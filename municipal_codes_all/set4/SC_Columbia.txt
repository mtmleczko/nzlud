PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Columbia, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through August 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to James S. Meggs, City Attorney, and his assistant Legal Department Administrative Coordinator Shari Lynn Ardis, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
(a)  In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances of the city, the following definitions and rules of construction shall be observed, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the city council or the text clearly requires otherwise: 
    And, or. The word "and" may be read as "or," and the word "or" as "and," where the sense requires it. 
    Bond. When a bond is required, an undertaking in writing shall be sufficient. 
    City. The term "the city" means the City of Columbia, in the County of Richland and State of South Carolina, except as otherwise provided. 
    Code. Whenever the words "Code" or "this Code" are used they shall mean and refer to the Code of Ordinances, City of Columbia, South Carolina, as designated in section 1-1. 
    Computation of time. The time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last day, and if the last day is Sunday or a legal holiday, that day shall be excluded. 
    Council and city council. The terms "the council" and "the city council" mean the City Council of Columbia, South Carolina, and shall be inclusive of the mayor. 
    County. The term "county" means the County of Richland and/or the County of Lexington in the State of South Carolina. 
    Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears in this Code requiring or authorizing the head of a department or other officer of the city to do some act or perform some duty, it shall be construed to authorize such department head or other officer to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to do the required act or perform the required duty unless the terms of the provision specifically designate otherwise.

Sec. 5-331. - Revocation of permit.

(b)  Upon the accumulation of 15 or more points or failure to comply with the requirements of this article, the following procedure shall be followed: 
(1)  The police chief or designee shall cause to be served written notice to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. Service shall be deemed complete if personally delivered upon the owner or agent by any officer authorized by law to serve process or a duly appointed law enforcement officer of the city police department. The person serving process shall make proof of service within the time during which the person served must respond to the process. If service cannot be personally made within the city, then service may be made by notice posted on the property and mailed certified return receipt to the last known address of record. 
(2)  The owner or agent shall have 15 days from the date of service to request a hearing to appeal the revocation of the permit. The request shall be sent to the police chief by certified mail, return receipt requested. If such request is not timely made, the revocation shall take effect on the 21st day after the date of service to show cause. 
(3)  Upon request for a hearing, the police chief or designee is authorized to schedule the appeal with the property maintenance board of appeals (PMBoA) at the next regularly scheduled meeting or special called meeting by the board. 
(4)  Once the hearing is scheduled, the property should be posted to announce the hearing date to the general public. 
(5)  In conducting the hearing, the PMBoA shall have the power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, compel the production of books, paper, and other documents, and receive evidence. All parties shall have an opportunity to respond, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross-examination and submit rebuttal evidence, to submit proposed findings of facts and orders, to file exceptions to the PMBoA's recommended order, and to be represented by counsel or other qualified representative. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The lack of actual knowledge of, acquiescence to, participation in, or responsibility for, a public nuisance at common law or a noxious use of private property on the part of the owner or agent shall not be a defense by such owner or agent. 
(6)  If the PMBoA finds that the accumulation of 15 or more points and the existence of a public nuisance at common law or noxious use of private property exist, then PMBoA shall prepare a recommended order. 
(7)  If the PMBoA finds no public nuisance at common law or noxious use of private property exists, or that the owner has recovered possession of the dwelling unit, the PMBoA will prepare a recommended order to dismiss the revocation action and recommend which points, if any, should be rescinded from the permit based upon the actions taken by the landlord to seek compliance with the city's ordinances. 
(8)  The PMBoA's recommended order shall consist of findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended relief. The police chief or designee shall transmit the recommended order to the city manager and the owner or agent. The owner or agent shall have 15 days from the date of the hearing officer's order to submit written exceptions to the PMBoA's recommended order. The city manager shall review such order and any written exceptions by the owner and may set forth any deficiencies he/she finds with respect to the order. Said deficiencies shall be limited to determinations that the findings were not based upon competent, substantial evidence, or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with the essential requirements of law. In reviewing such recommended order, the city manager shall not have the power to receive or consider additional evidence and shall not have the power to reject or modify the findings of fact or conclusions of law contained in the recommended order. The city manager may remand the recommended order along with the delineated deficiencies back to the PMBoA for consideration of the deficiencies. The PMBoA shall address the deficiencies in an addendum to the recommended order. The city manager shall then either: (a) adopt the recommended order and addendum, if applicable, in its entirety; or (b) adopt the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the recommended order and addendum, if applicable, and reject or modify the recommended relief. The action of the city manager shall be the final order of the city. 
(9)  The city manager or designee shall provide notice of the final order within five days of the date of the final order. 
(10)  If the permit is revoked under these procedures, the owner or agent shall have five days from the date of the final order to commence recovering possession of the rental unit. If the tenants do not voluntarily agree to vacate the premises, the owner or agent shall diligently pursue the process of eviction to completion. The owner or agent shall provide copies of all documents provided to the tenants or filed with the court concerning the eviction process to the city manager or designee. If the owner collects any rent from the tenants following the revocation of the permit, fails to comply with these provisions, or fails to abide with the final order of the city, the city may seek criminal relief by citing the owner for violation of section 5-326 (rental permit required), or seek other available legal or equitable relief. 
(11)  In addition to the above-described procedures, the city attorney is authorized to file for injunctive relief to abate the public nuisance at common law or noxious use of private property pursuant to law. 
(12)  The final order of the city is subject to certiorari review in a court of competent jurisdiction in Richland or Lexington County, South Carolina. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-332. - Effect of revocation. 
    Upon the commencement of revocation, no permit shall be granted nor any lease approved and no person, firm or corporation shall operate or rent/lease to another for residential occupancy any dwelling unit or rooming unit during such time that the rental housing permit for such unit is revoked; however any residential tenants under a lease in existence at the time of the commencement of revocation shall have all of the rights afforded to them under applicable state law. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-333. - Notification exemption. 
    Residential rental properties are exempt from the notification requirements, as given in the codes, when they have not obtained a valid permit for rental housing as required by this article. Properties operating without a valid rental permit shall receive one written warning and 20 working days to comply. If an owner is convicted of a violation of section 5-326 of the City of Columbia Code of Ordinances, the property shall not be eligible for a rental housing permit for a period of six months after the conviction. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-334. - Defenses. 
(a)  When tenants are guilty of offenses resulting in a revocation notice, the property owner may request a suspension of revocation proceedings by providing written evidence of the initiation of eviction proceedings against the culpable tenants. If the tenants are evicted, the property owner may request termination of the revocation proceedings. If revocation has been suspended but the tenants are not evicted, revocation proceedings will be reinstated by the city. A remediation plan, as outlined in section 5-341, which addresses any future problems with the tenants, will also have the same effect as initiating eviction proceedings. 
(b)  If the permit accumulates points which are solely caused by the behavior of a tenant, the Landlord or permit holder may apply for removal of those tenant-related points at the conclusion of eviction proceedings which result in the eviction of those tenants or upon proof that the tenants have vacated the property. If the city, by and through the chief of police, or his designee, agrees to remove the points after the landlord or permit holder presents a valid order of eviction of those tenants, the points shall be removed as if never assessed. If the chief of police, or his designee, does not agree to remove those points from the permit as tenant related, then the Landlord or permit holder may apply for a review by the city manager. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-335. - Operating without a permit a public nuisance. 
    If a person operates as a landlord without a rental permit as set forth in this section, such shall constitute a public nuisance.

(a)  Inspections . By applying for a permit, the owner agrees to allow inspection of the unit for violations of this article, as well as violations of the International Property Maintenance Code at any reasonable time; however, this provision shall not be interpreted as authorizing the city to conduct an inspection of an occupied rental unit without obtaining either the consent of an occupant or a warrant. 
(b)  Complaints . Each complainant shall be requested to state his/her name and addresses and give a statement of the facts giving rise to the complainant's belief that the provisions of this article are being violated. Such information may be obtained orally or in writing. A complainant may be subpoenaed to appear in a revocation or denial proceeding to provide evidence or testimony. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-337. - Offenses. 
    Any person violating any provision of this article shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor offense and shall be subject to the penalties outlined in section 1-5. Each day of violation shall be considered a separate offense. Punishment for violation shall not relieve the offender of liability for delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs provided for this article.

Sec. 5-338. - Denial of permit. 
(a)  The police chief or designee may deny issuance of any permits applied for under this section if it is determined either that the owner or agent has made material misrepresentations about the condition of his/her property or status of ownership, or that the occupancy of the property is in violation of the International Property Maintenance Code or city ordinances or that the owner has otherwise violated a provision of this article. 
(b)  If the police chief or designee determines there is reasonable cause to believe that there are grounds to deny a permit applied for the police chief or designee shall provide notice of the denial, including the grounds for the denial. 
(c)  Within 15 days of the date of the notice, the owner may request in writing to the police chief a hearing on the denial. The police chief or designee shall schedule the hearing to occur within 15 days after receiving the request for hearing and shall notify the owner at least five days in advance of the time and location for the hearing. The hearing may be postponed if mutually agreed upon by the police chief and the owner. 
(d)  The hearing shall be conducted informally and adherence to the rules of evidence normally followed by the courts shall not be required. Any person may present testimony, documents or other evidence as deemed relevant by the city manager or designee. Any person may be represented by counsel. 
(e)  The police chief or designee shall consider all evidence presented, and if the preponderance of the evidence supports the allegation of violation the permit shall be denied. If the preponderance of the evidence does not support the allegation of violation, the permit shall be issued. The decision of the police chief or designee may be appealed by a writ of certiorari to a court of competent jurisdiction in Richland County or Lexington County, South Carolina. 
(f)  The police chief or designee may waive the denial requirement as to any permit if it is determined that the owner has attempted in good faith to comply with this article. In determining asserted good faith as required for a waiver, the police chief or designee may consider, but not be limited to, the owner response to current violations and remedy of past violations. 
(g)  If a permit is denied under this section, the owner whose permit was denied shall not be issued another permit on the same dwelling unit for a period of six months after the date of denial. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-339. - Permit fee. 
(a)  The annual permit fee shall be $25.00 for each permit, unless: (1) the applicant is a professional management company applying on behalf of an owner as a responsible local party; or (2) the applicant is licensed by the City of Columbia through the business license office to conduct the business of being a landlord. 
(b)  Upon determination that a rental property owner has failed to obtain a rental housing permit, a permit fee shall be assessed at $400.00 for each year the unpermitted occupancy has occurred. 
(c)  An inspection fee of $50.00 shall be included in the permit fee for properties that fail to pass inspection after the second inspection. 
(d)  All required fees shall be paid before a rental permit is issued, including any past due fees assessed for work abated by city.

It is hereby declared that the intent of the council is that this article would have been adopted as if such illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional section, sentence, clause, part, or provision had not been included herein. 
( Ord. No. 2015-099, 4-19-16 ) 
Sec. 5-341. - Remediation plan. 
    Whenever points are assessed to a permit, the responsible party may establish a remediation plan with the city that outlines actions to be taken to remedy the violation of city ordinances. The plan must be approved by the police chief or his designee and include a timeline for implementation. Once the remediation plan is approved, the points against the permit will be suspended during the term of the remediation. When the remediation is completed successfully as agreed the points assessed prior to remediation will be removed. If the permit holder fails to adhere to the remediation plan, the plan will be withdrawn by the city and the points will be re-assessed.

Sec. 8-38. - Appeal procedures; hearing. 
(a)  Appeal of finding of nuisance: The responsible person, owner or occupant, or the lien holder of the property, may make a written demand to the housing official for a hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance in fact exists. This appeal stays the public abatement until such time as the matter is heard and decided by the hearing board. The appeal must be received by the housing official before the time specified in the notice. The appeal may be faxed or emailed to the manager. The written demand shall include a contact number, either phone or facsimile in order for the person to be informed of the hearing location, date and time. It shall not be a defense to the determination that a public nuisance exists that the property is boarded up or otherwise enclosed. The hearing board may amend or modify the notice to abate the public nuisance, or when appropriate under the facts presented, extend the time for compliance by the owner to such date as the majority of the appeals board may determine. The decisions of the board are final, and shall be delivered orally to the appellant on the date of the hearing, and then, if requested, written and mailed to the address provided. 
(b)  Failure to appeal: Failure to timely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the existence of a public nuisance. 
(c)  Appeal of assessment: Further, in those instances where the nuisance has been abated by the city after the required notice, the owner or occupant of the property who has been served with a notice of assessment pursuant to this article may make a written demand to the manager for a hearing to review the cost of the abatement. This appeal stays the attachment of the lien until such time as the matter is heard and decided by the hearing board. The appeal of the assessment must be received by the manager within five business days of the appellant's receipt of the notice of assessment. The written demand shall include a contact number, either phone or facsimile in order for the person to be informed of the hearing location, date and time. In an appeal of the assessment of costs, no testimony shall be permitted on the issue of the existence of the public nuisance. The decisions of the board are final, and shall be delivered orally to the appellant on the date of the hearing, and then, if requested, written and mailed to the address provided. 
(d)  Failure to appeal assessment: Failure to timely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the assessment of costs. 
(e)  Notice of the hearing: By way of the contact numbers provided in the written demand, the manager shall orally advise the owner of the location, date and time of the hearing. Notice of the hearing must be provided at least two business days prior to the hearing, excluding city recognized holidays and weekends. 
(f)  Time and manner of hearings: The hearings as allowed under this section shall be held as soon as practical but in any event no later than ten business days after receipt of the appeal, excluding city recognized holidays and weekends. The hearing shall not be conducted under the strict rules of evidence, but the board can have formal rules of procedure. The enforcement officer shall present the facts and circumstances that resulted in a conclusion that a public nuisance existed. The owner, occupant or lien holder, or their agents, representatives or attorneys shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the appeals board in the course of the hearing, and shall have the right of cross examination of the enforcement officer. When the nuisance has been abated by the city and the person has appealed the assessment of the administrative fee and actual costs, the hearing board shall have discretion to waive the administrative fee or the public cost of abating a nuisance, in whole or in part, if, in the course of the hearing reviewing the decision, the hearing board finds that justice and equity require such waiver or that any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this article: 
(1)  The notice to remove the nuisance; 
(2)  The work performed in abating the nuisance; 
(3)  The itemized computation of charges and costs of abatement alleged to be owed by the owner of the property to the city.

    In the event of refusal or neglect of a person to cause such nuisance to be abated in the manner and within the time provided herein, it shall be reported to the manager. The manager may, in a reasonable and prudent manner, direct the expenditure of public resources to abate the nuisance condition. Fee and costs shall be established by ordinance. The cost of abatement shall include an administrative assessment, title search costs, lien filing costs and any attorney's fees and costs made necessary when the public is compelled to collect through legal process, in addition to the actual cost of labor and materials expended in public abatement. The person shall be served with a notice of assessment within seven days of the completion of the abatement. The notice of assessment shall include the administrative fee and a statement of public cost, attested to by affidavit, and shall be issued and served upon the person responsible for payment who shall make payment within 30 days of the date of service. Upon the expiration of the 30-day period, if the amount has not been paid in full or contested before the manager, the manager may cause a lien in that amount to be filed with the county clerk of court and with the finance director of the city. The lien shall be of record in the county courthouse and the office of the finance director in the book of liens, until paid or recovered, or otherwise released. Collection of the lien by way of foreclosure may be instituted by the city attorney on behalf of the city.

(c)  Review of finding of nuisance: The responsible person, owner or occupant, or the lien holder of the property, may make a written demand to the city manager for a hearing on the question of whether a public nuisance in fact exists. This review does not stay the revocation of the license of permit, but a hearing will be scheduled with the city manager as soon as possible. The review must be received by the manager before the time specified in the notice. The review may be faxed or emailed to the manager. The written demand shall include an address and a contact number, either phone or facsimile, in order for the person to be informed of the hearing location, date and time. The city manager may amend or modify the notice of revocation, or when appropriate under the facts presented, extend the time for compliance by the owner to such date as the city manager may determine. The decisions of the city manager are final, and shall be delivered in written form within ten days and mailed to the address provided.

DIVISION 5. - REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO SMOKING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS 

Sec. 8-215. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Findings . As an incident to the adoption of the ordinance from which this division derives, the city council ("city council") of the City of Columbia, South Carolina (the "city") makes the following findings: 
(1)  Secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing 53,000 Americans prematurely each year; and 
(2)  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Toxicology Program's Report on Carcinogens, National Cancer Institute, and the International Agency for Research and Cancer have all reported that secondhand smoke is a Group A human carcinogen, a cancer causing substance, of which there is no safe level of exposure; and 
(3)  The health consequences of involuntary smoking have been reported by the U.S. Surgeon General to be a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy non-smokers; and 
(4)  The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that a simple separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of non-smokers; and 
(5)  Numerous medical and scientific studies show substantial levels of exposure to secondhand smoke among the United States population, and over the past two decades, the health hazards resulting from exposure to secondhand smoke have been increasingly recognized; and 
(6)  Secondhand smoke increases the risk of developing breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women; and when inhaled by pregnant women, secondhand smoke increases the risk for low-weight babies, pre-term delivery, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome(SIDS); and 
(7)  Exposure to secondhand smoke by children leads to decreased lung function, asthma, pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis and even sudden infant death syndrome; and 
(8)  Studies of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana and Pueblo, Colorado before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease; and 
(9)  Workplaces have been shown to be locations of significant exposure to secondhand smoke by employees working in the City of Columbia; and 
(10)  There are laws, ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards, including Class A carcinogens, asbestos, arsenic and benzene, but none which regulate exposure to secondhand smoke; and 
(11)  The South Carolina General Assembly at Section 44-95-10 et seq. (the "Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990") imposed certain limitations on smoking. For example, it limited smoking in government buildings (the definition of which includes city-owned buildings) except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas. 
City Council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this division. 
(b)  Intent. City council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this city to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace. Therefore, city council declares that the purpose of this act is to preserve and improve the health, comfort and environment of this city by limiting exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

    False alarm means the activation of a fire alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, improper maintenance, or the negligence of the owner or lessee of the fire alarm system or of his employees or agents. This does not include alarms caused by unauthorized tampering with a fire alarm system by anyone other than the fire alarm user or his agent. 
    Fire alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, installed by a fire alarm business, arranged to signal the occurrence of a fire, smoke, water flow or other condition to which the fire department may be expected to respond. 
    Fire alarm user means a person who is in control of any building, structure or facility where a fire alarm system is present.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 9-22. - False alarm procedure and user fee. 
(a)  Whenever fire department personnel respond to an activated fire alarm system, the fire official in charge of the incident shall determine if the response was caused by a false alarm and shall indicate that fact upon the incident report. 
(b)  The fire department shall regularly review incident reports to monitor the accumulation of false alarms at any one location. When two false alarms have occurred at the same location within one year, and the location is within the incorporated area of the city, the fire department shall notify the fire alarm user by letter, citing the location and date of each false alarm. The letter shall recommend that appropriate action be taken on the part of the fire alarm user to alleviate the causes of false alarms and shall include a statement that an accumulation of more than three false alarms within a year shall result in a charge for services. Another similar letter shall be sent when three false alarms have occurred at the same location within the year. 
(c)  When four false alarms have occurred at one location within a year, a user fee of $100.00 for service for false alarm response shall be billed to the property owner. Each additional false alarm within the year shall require the billing of an additional fee of $100.00. However, no fire alarm user shall be charged with accumulating more than one false alarm in any 24-hour period. The fee established by this section affords only partial recovery of the expenses incurred in responding to the false alarm. If payment of the fee, in full, has not been received within 30 days of billing, the fee shall increase to $300.00. 
(Ord. No. 94-59, 10-5-94) 
Sec. 9-23. - Evidence of repair accepted in lieu of fee. 
    An alarm user may submit evidence that a malfunctioning system has been repaired in lieu of paying a user fee within ten days of the date of notification of the fee. Evidence such as a receipt from a licensed alarm business with a statement of repairs made to the system is acceptable. For a repeated problem with a system after a repair is alleged to have been made, the city manager or his designee may decide not to accept an alternative to paying the fee.

ARTICLE I. - FALSE SECURITY ALARMS 

Sec. 10-1. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system when, upon inspection by the police department, there is no evidence of unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm does not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature. 
    Security alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, installed by a security alarm business, arranged to signal the occurrence of a criminal act, emergency, or other condition to which the Columbia Police Department may be expected to respond. 
    Security alarm user means a person who is in control of any building, structure or facility where a security alarm system is present. 
    Year means a 12-month period beginning with July 1 and ending on June 30 of each year. 
( Ord. No. 2015-100, 1-5-16 ) 
Sec. 10-2. - False alarm procedure and user fee. 
(a)  Whenever Columbia Police Department personnel respond to an activated security alarm system, the Columbia Police Department official in charge of the incident shall determine if the response was caused by a false alarm and shall indicate that fact upon the incident report. 
(b)  The Columbia Police Department shall regularly review incident reports to monitor the accumulation of false alarms at any one location. When two false alarms have occurred at the same location within one year, and the location is within the incorporated area of the city, the Columbia Police Department shall notify the security alarm user by letter, citing the location and date of each false alarm. The letter shall recommend that appropriate action be taken on the part of the security alarm user to alleviate the causes of false alarms and shall include a statement that an accumulation of any further false alarms within a year shall result in a charge for services. 
(c)  Upon a third false alarm occuring at one location within a year, a user fee of $25.00 for service for false alarm response shall be billed to the property owner. Each additional false alarm within the year shall require the billing of an additional fee of $100.00. However, no security alarm user shall be charged with accumulating more than one false alarm in any 24-hour period. The fee established by this section affords only partial recovery of the expenses incurred in responding to the false alarm. If payment of the fee, in full, has not been received within 30 days of billing, the fee shall increase to $300.00. 
If more than five false alarms occur at one location within a year, the Columbia Police Department will not respond to that location unless dispatched as a result of an emergency call to 911. 
( Ord. No. 2015-100, 1-5-16 ) 
Sec. 10-3. - Evidence of repair accepted in lieu of fee. 
    An alarm user may submit evidence that a malfunctioning system has been repaired in lieu of paying a user fee within ten days of the date of notification of the fee. Evidence such as a receipt from a licensed alarm business with a statement of repairs made to the system is acceptable. For a repeated problem with a system after a repair is alleged to have been made, the city manager or his designee may decide not to accept an alternative to paying the fee. 
( Ord. No. 2015-100, 1-5-16 ) 
Sec. 10-4. - Appeals. 
    Any person may appeal the imposition of a false alarm user fee to the city manager or his designee. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be made to the city manager within ten days of the date of notification of the fee.

(a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the business license ordinance, the business license tax for "retail telecommunications services", as defined in S. C.

The business license tax year shall begin on January 1 of each year. The rate for the 2005 business license tax year shall be the maximum rate allowed by State law as in effect on February 1, 2005. Declining rates shall not apply. 
(b)  In conformity with S.C. Code § 58-9-2220, the business license tax for "retail telecommunications services" shall apply to the gross income derived from the sale of retail telecommunications services for the preceding calendar or fiscal year which either originate or terminate in the municipality and which are charged to a service address within the municipality regardless of where these amounts are billed or paid and on which a business license tax has not been paid to another municipality. The measurement of the amounts derived from the retail sale of mobile telecommunications services shall include only revenues from the fixed monthly recurring charge of customers whose service address is within the boundaries of the municipality. For a business in operation for less than one year, the amount of business license tax shall be computed on a 12-month projected income. 
(c)  For the year 2005, the business license tax for "retail telecommunications services" shall be due on February 1, 2005, and payable by February 28, 2005, without penalty.

(d)  The delinquent penalty shall be five percent of the tax due for each month, or portion thereof, after the due date until paid. 
(e)  Exemptions in the business license ordinance for income from business in interstate commerce are hereby repealed. Properly apportioned gross income from interstate commerce shall be included in the gross income for every business subject to a business license tax. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to interfere with continuing obligations of any franchise agreement or contractual agreement in the event that the franchise or contractual agreement should expire after December 31, 2003. 
(g)  All fees collected under such a franchise or contractual agreement expiring after December 31, 2003, shall be in lieu of fees or taxes which might otherwise be authorized by this section. 
(h)  As authorized by S.C. Code § 5-7-300, the agreement with the Municipal Association of South Carolina for collection of current and delinquent license taxes from telecommunications companies pursuant to S.C. Code § 58-9-2200 shall continue in effect. Notwithstanding the provisions of the agreement, for the year 2005, the Municipal Association of South Carolina is authorized to collect current and delinquent license taxes, in conformity with the due date and delinquent date for 2005 as set out in this section and is further authorized, for the year 2005, to disburse business license taxes collected, less the service charge agreed to, to this municipality on or before April 1, 2005, and thereafter as remaining collections permit.

(4)  Any insurance policy provided to the city in satisfaction of the requirements of this subsection (b) shall specifically provide that the insurer provide written notice to the city at least 30 days prior to cancellation, termination or modification of the coverage provided to the city.

based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Tucson, Arizona - 1990; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Ft. Worth, Texas - 2004; Kennedale, Texas - 2005; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Jackson County, Missouri - 2008; Louisville, Kentucky - 2004; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); Dallas, Texas - 2007; "Rural Hotspots: The Case of Adult Businesses," 19 Criminal Justice Policy Review 153 (2008); and "Correlates of Current Transactional Sex among a Sample of Female Exotic Dancers in Baltimore, MD," Journal of Urban Health (2011), 
the city council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
    The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

ARTICLE IX. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 14-261. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council of the City of Columbia, South Carolina is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. 
    The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
    The city council intends, through the adoption of this article, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.

(b)  It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti has been applied and any person who may be in possession or who has the right to possess such property to at all times keep the property clear of graffiti.

d.  An information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance programs available through the city and private graffiti removal contractors. 
(2)  Exceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements of subsection (a) above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can demonstrate that:

(3)  Right of city to remove. 
a.  Use of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware or is notified and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the city shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the city manager, or other designee of the city manager, determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more extensive area. 
b.  Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and a release of the city from liability for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this article, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city shall commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions specified below.

Notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record cannot be found after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation. 
b.  Determination of hearing officer. The determination of the hearing officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If, after the due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the owner or the responsibility party or their respective agents, the hearing officer determines that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the hearing officer shall give written notice in an eradication order that, unless the graffiti is removed within ten days, the city shall enter upon the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall meet with the approval of the hearing officer), or such other eradication thereof as the hearing officer deems appropriate, and shall provide the owner and the responsible party thereafter with an accounting of the costs of the eradication effort on a full cost recovery basis. 
c.  Eradication effort. Not sooner than the time specified in the order of the hearing officer, the city manager, or the designee of the city manager, shall implement the eradication order and shall provide an accounting to the owner and the responsible party of the costs thereof. 
d.  Cost hearing. The owner or responsible party may request a cost hearing before the hearing officer on the eradication accounting, and appropriate due process must be extended to the owner or responsible party. If following the cost hearing, or if no hearing is requested, after the implementation of the eradication order, the hearing officer determines that all or a portion of the costs are appropriately chargeable to the eradication effort, the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting, or an amount thereof determined as appropriate by the hearing officer, shall be due and payable by the owner or responsible party within 30 days. Any amount of eradication charges assessed by the hearing officer that are less than the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting shall be explained by written letter from the hearing officer to the city council.

It shall be the duty of the board to authorize upon appeal in specific cases a variance from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals-form based codes that the conditions listed under subsection (3)b. of this section have been met. 
2.  No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts, shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
3.  In granting any variance, the board may prescribe conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article. 
b.  Procedures in consideration of request for variance. 
1.  A written application for a variance shall be submitted demonstrating that: 
(i)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the piece of property; 
(ii)  These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity; 
(iii)  Because of these conditions, the application of this division to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and 
(iv)  The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
2.  The board may not grant a variance the effects of which would be to allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning district, to extend physically a nonconforming use of land, or to change the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably should a variance be granted, may not be considered grounds for a variance. 
3.  Notice of public hearing shall be posted on the property for which variance is sought and shall be published at least 15 days prior to the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
4.  The hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by agent or by attorney. 
5.  The board of zoning appeals-form based codes shall make findings that the requirements of subsection (3)b.1. of this section have been met by the applicant for a variance. 
6.  The board of zoning appeals-form based codes shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
7.  The board of zoning appeals-form based codes shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
8.  The board of zoning appeals-form based codes may prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the variance is requested shall be begun or completed, or both. 
c.  Effect of failure to meet conditions. 
1.  Violation of conditions and safeguards prescribed in conformity with this article, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article, punishable under penalties established in this article. 
2.  Failure to begin or complete, or begin and complete, an action for which a variance is granted, within the time limit specified, when such time limit is made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall void the variance.

Sec. 17-201. - Intent regarding nonconforming structures and uses. 
    Within the districts established by this article, or by amendments which may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the ordinance from which this article is derived was passed or before an amendment to this article was passed, but which would be prohibited or regulated and restricted under the terms of this article or future amendment. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Nonconforming uses are declared by this article to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is the further intent of this article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, reconstructed to continue nonconformity after major damage, or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3041) 
Sec. 17-202. - Continuance of nonconforming structures and uses. 
(a)  Change to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, structure, or characteristic of use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use, structure, or characteristic of use unless the board of zoning appeals finds that the new use, structure, or characteristic of use is more in character with the uses permitted in the district, in which case the zoning board of adjustment may permit such change as a special exception. In permitting the change, the board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose of this article. 
(b)  Conversion of use on nonconforming lots. The minimum yard requirements of this article shall not be construed as prohibiting the conversion of an existing building which does not meet the minimum yard requirements to another permitted use, so long as no further encroachment is made into the existing yards. 
(c)  Demolition and reconstruction. A nonconforming structure shall not be demolished and rebuilt as a nonconforming structure. 
(d)  Extension or enlargement. A nonconforming use, structure or characteristic of use shall not be extended, enlarged or intensified except in conformity with this article; provided, however, that any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or at the time of amendment of this article, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside that building. 
(e)  Reestablishment. A nonconforming use or characteristic of use shall not be reestablished after vacancy, abandonment or discontinuance for any period of 12 consecutive months, except where subsection (f) of this section applies. When a nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use, the nonconforming use may not be reestablished at any time. 
(f)  Reconstruction after damage. A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired except in conformity with this article after sustaining damage exceeding 75 percent of the replacement cost of the structure at the time of damage, provided that any permitted reconstruction shall begin within six months from the time of damage and shall be completed within 12 months after the issuance of a building permit. 
(g)  Extended time for reestablishment in design preservation districts. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a nonconforming use in a design preservation district may be established after vacancy, abandonment or discontinuance of a prior nonconforming use for an period of up to 36 consecutive months, by special exception by the board of zoning appeals. The board of zoning appeals shall not grant a special exception except upon a finding that the nonconforming use proposed is more in character with the uses permitted in the district than the prior nonconforming use. In addition, the zoning board of adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose of this article. 
(h)  Certain nonconforming uses in RD district. 
(1)  As a transition period for certain structures in areas being rezoned from RG-2-DP to RD-DP, any nonconforming structure(s), after sustaining casualty damage exceeding 75 percent of the replacement costs of the structure(s), may until 2050 be permitted to be rebuilt, but shall not exceed that number of dwelling units as were conforming on the particular lot when the RD designation was imposed. Reconstruction is otherwise subject to all other provisions of this chapter governing reconstruction of nonconforming structures after damage. 
(2)  As a transition period for certain structures in areas being rezoned from RG-3-DP to RD-DP, any nonconforming structure(s) containing six or more dwelling units, after sustaining casualty damage exceeding 75 percent of the replacement costs of the structure(s), may until 2050 be permitted to be rebuilt, but shall not exceed that number of dwelling units as were conforming on the particular lot when the RD-DP designation was imposed.

The interim zoning district classification(s) shall be specified in the annexation ordinance considered by city council and such classification(s) shall become effective on the effective date of the annexation. After the effective date of the annexation, the zoning administrator shall initiate zoning amendment procedures to establish or confirm the zoning district classification for the annexed area.

(b)  The regulations in this article have been made with reasonable consideration of, among other things, the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city. 
(c)  The regulations of this division shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land located within any of the following district classifications respectively: 
D-1 Development District RS-1 Single-Family Residential District RS-1A Single-Family Residential District RS-1B Single-Family Residential District RS-2 Single-Family Residential District RS-3 Single-Family Residential District RD Two-Family Residential District RD-2 Mill Village Two-Family Residential District RG-1 General Residential District RG-1A General Residential District RG-2 General Residential District RG-3 Townhouse and High-Rise Residential District UTD Urban Transitional District C-1 Office and Institutional District C-2 Neighborhood Commercial District C-3 General Commercial District C-3A General Commercial Overlay District C-4 Central Area Commercial District C-5 Central Business District C-6 Limited Commercial District MX-1 Mixed-Use Corridor/Neighborhood District MX-2 Mixed-Use Urban M-1 Light Industrial District M-2 Heavy Industrial District PUD-R Residential Planned Unit Development District PUD-C Commercial Planned Unit Development District -MU Multiple Use Areas -AP Airport Height Restrictive Area -FW Floodway Area -FP Floodplain Area -DP Design and Preservation Area -S Sign Designated Area -DD Design/Development District -PD Planned Development Area -5P Five Points Overlay District -ID Innovista Design District -NC North Main Corridor  
(Code 1979, § 6-3061; Ord. No. 98-079, 11-18-99; Ord. No. 2008-025, 6-18-08; Ord. No. 2009-36, 6-3-09; Ord. No. 2009-131, 3-7-10; Ord. No. 2010-110, 7-28-10) 
Sec. 17-232. - D-1 development district. 
    The D-1 district is intended to provide for large tracts of land located primarily on the fringe of urban growth where the predominant character of urban development has not yet been fully established, but where the current characteristics of use are predominantly residential, agricultural or similar development, with scattered related uses. Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, recreational and other needs of such areas are permitted as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to ensure compatibility of uses within the district and adjacent thereto. It is further recognized that future demand for developable land will generate requests for amendments to remove land from the D-1 classification and place it into other more intensely developed classifications as natural consequences of urban expansion. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3062) 
Sec. 17-233. - RS-1, RS-1A, RS-1B, RS-2 and RS-3 single-family residential districts. 
    The RS-1, RS-1A, RS-1B, RS-2 and RS-3 districts are intended as single-family residential areas with detached units with low to medium population densities. Use regulations for the single-family districts are identical, but contain varying classes of lot width and lot area, and these dimensional differences are intended to be preserved. Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, noncommercial recreational, and other needs of those areas are permitted outright within such districts or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to preserve and protect the single-family residential character of the district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3063) 
Sec. 17-234. - RD and RD-2 two-family residential district. 
    The RD and RD-2 districts are intended as one- and two-family residential areas with attached and detached units with medium to high population densities. RD-2 is intended for use only in Historic Mill Village areas and only shall be applied where more than 50 percent of the parcels retain the original Mill Village residence. Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, noncommercial recreational, and other needs of those areas are permitted outright within such districts or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to preserve and protect the two-family residential character of the district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3064; Ord. No. 2010-110, 7-28-10) 
Sec. 17-235. - RG-1, RG-1A and RG-2 general residential districts. 
    The RG-1, RG-1A and RG-2 districts are intended as medium and high density residential areas permitting progressively higher population densities, characterized by single-family detached, two-family detached and multiple-family structures, and garden type apartments. Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, noncommercial recreational, and other needs of the areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to preserve and protect the residential character of the districts. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3065) 
Sec. 17-236. - RG-3 townhouse and high-rise residential district. 
    The RG-3 district is intended as a medium to high density residential area characterized by townhouses and high-rise structures. Certain structures and uses required to serve governmental, educational, religious, noncommercial recreational, and other needs of the areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to preserve and protect the residential character of the district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3066) 
Sec. 17-237. - UTD urban transitional district. 
    The UTD district is intended to accommodate uses typically found in single-family areas undergoing transition to commercial office uses. District land uses will preserve the area's existing residential character while permitting commercial uses that are low traffic generators. This district frequently occurs along developing street corridors and connects commercial clusters. The residential character is preserved through the use of residential materials (i.e., brick, siding, stucco, etc.) and the use of pitched roofs on new buildings. Also traffic impacts will be lessened by minimizing curb cuts, with possible shared driveways. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3066.1) 
Sec. 17-238. - C-1 office and institutional district. 
    The C-1 district is intended to accommodate office, institutional, and certain types of residential uses in areas whose characteristic is neither general commercial nor exclusively residential in nature. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of the areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3067) 
Sec. 17-239. - C-2 neighborhood commercial district. 
    The C-2 district is intended to accommodate commercial and service uses oriented primarily to serving the needs of persons who live or work in nearby areas. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of such areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3068) 
Sec. 17-240. - C-3 general commercial district. 
    The C-3 district is intended to accommodate a variety of general commercial and nonresidential uses characterized primarily by retail, office and service establishments and oriented primarily to major traffic arteries or extensive areas of predominantly commercial usage and characteristics. Certain related structures and uses are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. It is not the intent of this article to encourage the development of long, narrow strips of commercial development fronting on major arteries, often referred to as strip commercial areas. Such development is often incompatible with adjacent uses and may lead to the eventual formation of commercial slums, damage the traffic-carrying capacities of streets, increase congestion, lead to depreciation of property values in adjacent areas, encourage undue dispersion of commercial facilities to the inconvenience of the public, and create disproportionate costs in the provision of governmental services. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3069) 
Sec. 17-241. - C-3A general commercial overlay district. 
    The C-3A district is intended to accommodate a variety of general commercial and nonresidential uses characterized primarily by retail, office and service establishments. It is oriented primarily to major traffic arteries or extensive areas of predominantly commercial use and characteristics. Traffic impacts will be lessened by minimizing curb cuts, with possible shared driveways. Also, there will be no outside storage of goods or materials. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3069.1) 
Sec. 17-242. - C-4 central area commercial district. 
    The C-4 district is intended to accommodate retail, office, service and distribution uses generally benefitting by location in the central area of the city, and generally complementary to uses and characteristics of use ordinarily found in the retail core or central business district. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of such areas are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. A principal purpose of the C-4 district is to provide for uses complementary to those found in the C-5 central business district zone, but simultaneously to create a character less congested than that of the C-5 district by requiring yards and off-street parking. It is, therefore, the intent of this article that C-4 central area commercial districts be established only contiguous to or in the immediate vicinity of the C-5 central business district zone. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3070) 
Sec. 17-243. - C-5 central business district. 
    The C-5 district is intended to accommodate those uses which, taken together, form the central business district, characterized by retail core uses, intensive office employment, and complementary uses intended to serve persons who shop or work in the central business district. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of the area are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the needs of this district. Since the central business district of the city serves a unique and special function, it is the intent of this article that the C-5 district classification be applied to one contiguous and continuous area, and that before additional areas contiguous to those already classified C-5 are considered for inclusion within the C-5 district, consideration should be given to the appropriateness of the C-4 central area commercial district as an alternate designation intended to create a less congested character than that of the C-5 district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3071) 
Sec. 17-244. - C-6 limited commercial district. 
    The C-6 district is intended to accommodate those uses which complement the existing commercial character of shopping areas which serve a unique and special function within the city. This district is characterized by a strong core of small businesses and a mixture of various types of eating and drinking establishments. It is the intent of this article that the C-6 district classification be applied to one contiguous and continuous area. Certain uses are permitted outright, while others are permitted as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this district classification. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3072) 
Sec. 17-245. - M-1 light industrial district. 
    The M-1 district is intended to accommodate wholesaling, distribution, storage, processing, light manufacturing and general commercial uses. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of such uses are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3073) 
Sec. 17-246. - M-2 heavy industrial district. 
    The M-2 district is intended to accommodate primarily those uses of a manufacturing and industrial nature, and secondarily those uses which are functionally related thereto such as distribution, storage and processing. General commercial uses are allowed but are considered incidental to the predominantly industrial nature of the district. Certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of the primary uses are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article. In addition, certain uses are permitted only as special exceptions or are prohibited in order to protect such uses from the potentially incompatible characteristics of industrial areas. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3074) 
Sec. 17-247. - Planned unit development districts. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of planned unit development districts is to derive the benefits of efficiency, economy and flexibility by encouraging unified development of large sites, while also obtaining the advantage of creative site design, improved appearance, compatibility of uses, optimum service by community facilities, and better functioning of vehicular access and circulation. It is the intent of this article to allow development of large sites subject to specific regulations concerning permitted uses, but only subject to regulations concerning lot area, building coverage, yard spaces and building height insofar as the city council shall deem appropriate to fulfill the intent of this article, upon presentation of certification from the owners, developers or other parties at interest in the development of such sites that they will adhere to development policies which will fulfill the intent of this article. 
(b)  Types of districts. Two types of districts accommodating primarily residential or nonresidential uses are created as follows: 
(1)  PUD-R Planned Unit Development-Residential. The PUD-R district is intended to accommodate residential uses, with nonresidential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
(2)  PUD-C Planned Unit Development-Commercial. The PUD-C district is intended to accommodate primarily nonresidential uses, with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
(c)  Design and planning features. The types of residential dwelling units and the types of nonresidential uses allowed to be established in such districts increase with increasing site size of such districts, based upon the premise that increased site size will allow proper design, including functional interrelations, buffer treatments separating uses with potentially incompatible characteristics of use, design of access patterns, and relationships of uses within such planned unit developments with uses in adjacent districts. It is the intent of this article that such design and planning features be incorporated properly into any PUD district hereafter created, and that the planning commission and city council shall consider the existence and appropriateness of such features before any amendment to the zoning map is adopted to create such district. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3075) 
Sec. 17-248. - -MU multiple use overlay district. 
    It is the intent of the -MU overlay district to protect and improve the quality of the environment of the city by the identification and encouragement of efficient redevelopment of central city areas whose predominant character is no longer clearly defined, or areas where a more efficient use of the land can be promoted by permitting multiple uses. The multiple use concept is intended to promote utilization of innovative and creative urban design concepts. Such concepts are expected to achieve a more desirable urban environment than might be achieved through conventional urban development. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3076) 
Sec. 17-249. - -AP airport height restrictive area. 
    It is the intent of the -AP area to restrain influences which are adverse to the proper and safe conduct of aircraft operations in the vicinity of Owens Field Airport, to prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation, to prevent conflict with land development which may result in loss of life and property, and to encourage development which is compatible with airport use characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, the -AP designation, when appended to a basic district classification, is intended to coordinate the purpose and intent of this section with other regulations duly established by the city whose primary intent is to further the purposes set out in this section. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3077) 
Sec. 17-250. - -FW and -FP flood protective areas. 
    Certain areas within the city are subject to periodic inundation by floodwater, which results or may reasonably be foreseen to result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These hazards are caused or extended in part by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses which increase flood damage upon other lands or uses which are vulnerable to floods because they are inadequately elevated or not otherwise protected from flood damages. It is, therefore, the intent of this article to lessen such hazards or losses by restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood hazards at the time of initial construction; and by controlling filling, grading, mineral extraction, placing of obstructions within flood channels and other activities, uses or characteristics of use which may increase flood damage. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3078) 
Sec. 17-251. - -DP design and preservation area. 
    It is the intent of this article to protect and improve the quality of the environment of the city by the encouragement of identification, recognition, conservation, maintenance and enhancement of areas, sites, structures, fixtures and other features of the architectural, economic, social, cultural and political history of the city as well as its natural features; to encourage appropriate use of such features, areas, sites, structures and fixtures; and to restrain influences adverse to such purposes, and by so doing to promote the public welfare. To this end, the -DP designation, when appended to a basic district classification, is intended to coordinate the purposes and intent of this article with those regulations established by other provisions whose primary intent is to further the purposes set out in this section. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3079) 
Sec. 17-252. - -S sign designated area. 
    The -S overlay district is intended to provide for the removal of signs from buildings which are no longer being used for the purpose which the sign advertises. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3080) 
Sec. 17-253. - -DD design/development area. 
    The -DD area is intended to protect the area identified as "City Center" which is undergoing redevelopment and revitalization from incompatible land uses and influences which do not complement or promote the high-intensity mixed use character of the area. It is also the intent that new developments within the -DD area are coordinated to ensure that the land use, pedestrian environment, urban design, open space, signs, street scape and traffic circulation are sensitive to and implement the overall objectives and concept of the applicable redevelopment plan. Development within the -DD area must comply with design guidelines set forth in this Code and in the publication "City Center Design/Development Guidelines, Final Report, September 1, 1998," LDR International, Inc. Consultants. 
    The -DD area consists of approximately 1,400 acres in the area bounded as follows: on the North by Elmwood Avenue, east by Pickens Street, South by Blossom Street, and West by the Congaree River. Any lot of record which fronts or abuts Elmwood, Pickens or Blossom within the area described above shall be deemed to fall within the -DD area. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3081; Ord. No. 98-079, 11-18-99) 
Sec. 17-254. - -PD planned development district. 
    The -PD area is intended to protect the Congaree vista and other areas of the city undergoing redevelopment and revitalization from incompatible land uses and influences which do not complement or promote the high-intensity mixed use character of the area. It is also the intent that new developments within the -PD area are coordinated to ensure that the land use, pedestrian environment, urban design, open space, signs, streetscape and traffic circulation are sensitive to and implement the overall objectives and concept of the applicable redevelopment plan. 
(Code 1979, § 6-3082) 
Sec. 17-255. - -CS collector street (minor thoroughfare) sign overlay district. 
    The -CS overlay district is intended to provide for the commercial promotion of business enterprises and/or presentation of public service information along appropriate, designated collector (minor thoroughfare) streets in the City of Columbia's zoning jurisdiction.

Sec. 17-256. - -AS arterial street (major thoroughfare) sign overlay district. 
    The -AS overlay district is intended to provide for the commercial promotion of business enterprises and/or presentation of public service information along appropriate, designated arterial (major thoroughfare) streets in the City of Columbia's zoning jurisdiction.

Sec. 17-278. - Orientation of required yards. 
    In interpretation of requirements related to establishment of required yards, the zoning administrator shall apply the following interpretation to the orientation of those yards: 
(1)  Through lots. In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing front yard pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall be provided on all frontages. Where one of the front yards that would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the zoning administrator may waive the requirement for the normal front yard and substitute therefor a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards existing on lots within the same block. 
(2)  Corner lots with two frontages. In the case of corner lots with two frontages, a front yard of the required depth shall be provided on the frontage of the street having the higher traffic volume. Where the traffic volumes on both streets are approximately equal, the required depth shall be provided on the street frontage having the minimum lot width. A second front yard of half the depth required generally for front yards in the district shall be provided on the other frontage. 
(3)  Corner lots with more than two frontages. In the case of corner lots with more than two frontages. the zoning administrator shall determine the front yard requirements, subject to the following limitations: 
a.  At least one front yard shall be provided having the full depth required in the district. 
b.  No other front yard on that lot shall have less than half the full depth required generally. 
(4)  Appropriateness of orientation; authority of zoning administrator. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) of this section, the zoning administrator may determine that the most appropriate orientation for any required yard is different from the orientation as set forth in subsections (1) through (3) of this section in such instance that it appears that such different orientation will further the intent of this article. When a structure is to be built which will contain more than one dwelling unit, the orientation of required yards shall be based upon both the orientation of the lot and the orientation of the structure. The zoning administrator may impose an orientation of yards different from the orientation set forth in this section and elsewhere in this article subject only to appeal of the decision to the board of zoning appeals as an appeal from an administrative decision of the zoning administrator.

A base station is distinct from a tower. The definition of base station is intended to be consistent with the FCC's interpretations of that word under Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act. An existing base station includes a structure that, at the time of the application, supports or houses an antenna, transceiver, or other associated equipment that constitutes part of a "base station" as defined above, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. 
(3)  Carrier on wheels (COW). A portable, self-contained wireless communication facility that is transported to a location to provide wireless services on a temporary or emergency basis. 
(4)  Board of zoning appeals (BOZA). The board that reviews requests for special exceptions. 
(5)  Collocation. 
a.  The placement of two or more provider's wireless communication antenna upon the same wireless communication facility; or 
b.  The mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. 
(6)  Communication tower. Is a guy-wire communication tower, a lattice communication tower or a monopole communication tower only. 
a.  Guy-wire communication tower. A ground-mounted tower supported by guys extending from various points upon the tower to anchors at the base of the tower that supports wireless communication antenna. 
b.  Lattice communication tower. A ground-mounted, many-legged, self-supporting tower created by the joining of structural members that supports wireless communication antenna. 
c.  Monopole communication tower. A ground-mounted, pole-shaped, self-supporting tower that supports wireless communication antenna. 
(7)  Eligible facilities request means any request for modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that involves: 
(i)  Collocation of new transmission equipment; 
(ii)  Removal of transmission equipment; or 
(iii)  Replacement of transmission equipment. 
This definition does not include replacement of the underlying structure. 
(8)  Eligible support structure. Is any structure that falls within this section's definitions of a tower or base station. 
(9)  Equipment building or cabinet. Is an accessory structure that contains equipment necessary for the proper operation of wireless communication antenna. 
(10)  Stealth wireless communication facility. A structure fabricated in a manner that aesthetically masks its appearance as a wireless communication facility, including but not limited to a flagpole, tree, light standard, or bell tower. 
(11)  Support structure. A structure that supports wireless communication antenna and/or an equipment building or cabinet including but not limited to an existing structure, guy-wire communication tower, lattice communication tower, a monopole communication tower, and stealth wireless communication facility. 
(12)  Tower. A structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities. 
(13)  Transmission equipment. Any equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, and other relevant equipment associated with and necessary to their operation, including coaxial or fiber optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. This definition includes equipment used in any technological configuration associated with any FCC authorized wireless transmission, licensed or unlicensed, terrestrial or satellite, including commercial mobile, private mobile, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul or fixed broadband. 
(14)  Transmission system. Is broadly defined to include any telecommunications, broadcast, satellite, commercial mobile service, or other communications system that employs radio spectrum. 
(15)  Wireless communication facility (WCF). The principal use that consists of a wireless communication antenna, support structure, and/or an equipment building or cabinet. 
(16)  Zoning administrator. Means the City of Columbia's zoning administrator or his or her designee. 
(c)  Districts where permitted, height, and setbacks. WCFs may be located in accordance with, and built to a height outlined within, Table 3, "Permissibility of and Bulk Requirements for Wireless Communication Facilities According to Support Structure" and any other applicable subsection.

Notes: (1) Includes property zoned similarly within Richland or Lexington Counties as well as PUD-R. (2) See 17-275, Table 2. Schedule of Major Height and Area Requirements as well as § 17-276 and § 17-278 for determination of appropriate setback from property line and/or public right-of-way. (3) Height may be increased by 30 feet only where the applicant demonstrates to the board of zoning appeals that (a) the additional height is necessary to accommodate co-location and (b) the structure is designed and engineered to accommodate additional WCFs.  
(d)  Application process for all WCFs. Applications are located at the City of Columbia Zoning Division. Applications and an applicable fee must be submitted to the same office to initiate the approval process. All applications must contain the following: 
(1)  An application form signed by the applicant. 
(2)  A copy of lease or letter of authorization from the property owner indicating applicant's authority to pursue zoning application. Financial information need not be disclosed and may be redacted. Where the planned location is in a public right-of-way or on public property, an applicant must submit a copy of the franchise agreement authorizing the applicant's use of the right-of-way or property. 
(3)  Site plans detailing proposed improvements which complies with the city's existing site-plan requirements. Drawings must depict all proposed improvements, including, but not limited to, property boundaries, setbacks, landscaping, fencing, topography, elevation sketch, and dimensions of improvement. Staff is interested in materials to be used, color options, and photographs or illustrations and examples of similar completed projects. 
(4)  Where special exceptions are sought, information necessary for the board of zoning appeals to decide whether to grant a special exception. See section 17-112 and this section. 
(e)  Approvals required for WCFs and support structures. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) below, any person or company, including those holding franchises granted by the city, must receive zoning approval before constructing WCFs or adding on to existing structures. 
(1)  Staff review. The zoning administrator may review and determine applications for antennas, collocations, certain WCFs, minor modifications to existing structures, and applications for COWs not to last more than 120 days. If the zoning administrator determines that the character or size of the proposed antennas, collocations, certain WCFs, or minor modifications should require further approval, the zoning administrator shall defer the application to the BOZA based on the criteria found in Table 3, "Permissibility of and Bulk Requirements for Wireless Communication Facilities According to Support Structure" and any other applicable subsection. 
(2)  Review procedure for WCFs and support structures. 
a.  Within 30 days of the receipt of an application, the city's zoning administrator shall either deem the application complete or inform the applicant in writing of the reasons why the application is deemed incomplete, specifying the code provision, ordinance, application instruction, or otherwise publicly-stated procedures that were not followed. If the application is deemed incomplete, the timeframe for the review process is suspended until the applicant submits a complete application. If the applicant fails to resubmit a complete application within 60 days of receiving notice that its first application was incomplete, the application is considered withdrawn without prejudice and may only be resubmitted with a new application fee. For good cause shown, the department may in writing extend the 60-day deadline. 
b.  Unless the review process is suspended in accordance with subsection (e)(2)a. or if the applicant agrees to an extension of time, the staff at the city's zoning department must issue a written decision granting or denying the application within 90 days of the date of the initial application. 
c.  If the application is denied, the applicant will be informed in writing of why there is substantial evidence that application is inconsistent with city ordinances. 
d.  Any applicant may appeal a decision approving, approving with conditions, or denying an application within 30 days by filing an appeal with the board of zoning appeals. 
(f)  Approvals required for an "Eligible Facilities Request" for modifications to existing wireless towers or base stations. 
(1)  The zoning administrator will approve any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station. 
(2)  For purposes of subsection (f), a substantial change is a modification that substantially changes the physical dimensions of a tower or base station if it meets any of the following criteria: 
a.  For towers outside of public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than 10 percent, or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; for those towers in the rights-of-way and for all base stations, it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent or ten feet, whichever is greater; 
b.  For towers outside of public rights-of-way, it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for those towers in the rights-of-way and for all base stations, it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet; 
c.  It involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; 
d.  It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site of the tower or base station; 
e.  It would defeat the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station; or 
f.  It does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station unless the non-compliance is due to an increase in height, increase in width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation that does not exceed the corresponding "substantial change" thresholds identified above. 
(3)  Other considerations. 
a.  For purposes of evaluating whether a modification is a "substantial change," the changes in height resulting from a modification should be measured from the original support structure in cases where the deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act on February 22, 2012. 
b.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the city may continue to enforce and condition approval on compliance with generally applicable building, structural, electrical, safety codes, and with other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety. 
(4)  Review and approval procedure for an "Eligible Facilities Request." 
a.  Timeframe for review. Within 60 days of the receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request, the zoning administrator shall review and then approve the application, unless it determines that the application proposes a substantial change to the physical dimensions of a tower or base station or is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of this section. 
b.  Tolling the timeframe for review. 
(i)  The zoning administrator's timeframe for review will be tolled if the zoning administrator and the applicant mutually agree to toll the timeframe, or if the zoning administrator determines the application is incomplete. 
(ii)  To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the zoning administrator must provide written notice within 30 days of receipt of the application, identifying the missing information, specifying the code provision, ordinance, application instruction, or otherwise publicly-stated procedures that were not followed. 
(iii)  If the applicant makes a supplemental submission, the timeframe for review will begin running again, but may be tolled again if the zoning administrator provides written notice within ten days after receiving supplemental information, specifying that the application is still incomplete, and identifying the missing information, specifying the code provision, ordinance, application instruction, or otherwise publicly-stated procedures that were not followed. If any supplemental submissions are incomplete, the Zoning Administrator must provide written notice of incompleteness within ten (10) days of receiving the supplemental submission. If the ten-day period in this subsection expires, the timeframe for review may not be further tolled for incompleteness. 
c.  Interaction with subsection (e). If the zoning administrator determines that the application presents a substantial change or is otherwise not covered by Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, the application will be considered under subsection (e), above. The timeframe for review subsection (e) will begin to run from the date the zoning administrator issues its decision. The zoning administrator may request the applicant submit additional information, as required under subsection (e). 
(g)  General standards for WCFs. In considering applications for WCFs, except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) above, the zoning administrator shall make all reasonable efforts insofar as practical to find that: 
(1)  The proposed WCF would emulate an architectural or landscape feature typical of, or appropriate to, the surrounding area. 
(2)  The proposed WCF would respect and, to the extent possible, compliment the style, height, bulk mass, material, and color of existing buildings, structures, vegetation, or uses within the surrounding area; 
(3)  The proposed WCF would preserve existing vegetation; 
(4)  The proposed WCF would preserve scenic view sheds; 
(5)  The proposed WCF would respect existing topography, including minimizing the extent to which the proposed WCF would be a dominant feature upon a hill, crest, ridgeline or other topographical high point; 
(6)  Conceal conduit internally and streamline antenna and equipment; 
(7)  Color match antenna and equipment with existing poles, buildings, and background; and 
(8)  Use decorative metal or fiberglass supports consistent with the redevelopment or esthetics efforts of the area. 
(h)  Special exception criteria. 
(1)  Standards for approval. In addition to the criteria for special exceptions set forth in section 17-112(2), the BOZA shall, in considering any applications that require special exceptions relating to WCF's find that: 
a.  The proposed WCF would not endanger the safety of residents, employees, or travelers, including but not limited to the likelihood of the failure of such structure; 
b.  The proposed WCF would not be located where it would substantially detract from aesthetics and neighborhood character or impair the use of neighboring properties; 
c.  The proposed WCF, if a communication tower is not located within 1,000 feet of another communication tower; 
d.  The proposed user has attempted to co-locate upon existing WCFs; and, 
e.  The proposed user will allow other users to co-locate upon the WCF in the future subject to the engineering capabilities of the structure. 
(2)  Additional standards for approval for stealth WCFs and certain existing WCFs upon existing structures. In addition to the criteria for special exceptions set forth in section 17-112(2) and section 17-283(h)(1) above, the BOZA shall, in considering applications for special exceptions for stealth WCFs and certain WCFs upon existing structures, find that: 
a.  The proposed WCF would emulate an architectural or landscape feature typical of, or appropriate to, the surrounding area; 
b.  The proposed WCF would respect, and to the extent possible compliment, the style, height, bulk, mass, material and color of existing buildings, structures, vegetation or uses within the surrounding area; 
c.  The proposed WCF would preserve existing vegetation; 
d.  The proposed WCF would preserve scenic view sheds; 
e.  The proposed WCF would respect existing topography, including minimizing the extent to which the proposed WCF would be a dominant feature upon a hill, crest, ridgeline or other topographical high point; 
f.  Where the proposed WCF would be located within or within 300 feet of a D-1, RS-1,RS-1A, RS-1B, RS-2, RS-3 or RD zoning district, the applicant shall conduct a neighborhood information meeting at least 14 calendar days prior to the public hearing at the board of zoning appeals. At least 14 calendar days prior to the neighborhood information meeting, the applicant shall distribute flyers to the neighborhood president, if such person is registered with the Columbia Council of Neighborhoods, and all property owners within 1,000 feet of the proposed location, informing said persons of the date, time location and general topic of the meeting; 
g.  The applicant for a special exception under this section shall send a notice of the public hearing by certified mail return receipt requested, to all property owners of parcels that are located within 1,000 ft. of the lot to contain the wireless communication facility (cell tower) at least 14 calendar days prior to the hearing date. Addresses used for the mailing shall be the most current listed with the Richland County Tax Assessor. This notice shall contain the following information: 
(i)  The date, time and place of the hearing; 
(ii)  A description to inform the public of the location of the property for which the special exception is requested, including the street address and the tax map reference; 
(iii)  The description of the request to include the type and height of the facility requested. 
(i)  Additional criteria. 
(1)  Where a new communication tower or a new stealth WCF would be "visible" from property listed within the National Register of Historic Places, the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Officer must issue a letter stating that the design would have no adverse effect before the zoning administrator or his or her designee shall issue a zoning permit. Where a new communication tower or a new stealth WCF would be "visible" from property listed within a locally designated architectural conservation district, historic commercial district, a local individual landmark, or landmark district, staff must review and approve the design of the structure. To determine whether or not a proposed WCF would be "visible" as the term is used within above, apply a line of site six feet above grade from the property line of any property that would be within a 1,000-foot radius from the proposed WCF. Stealth WCFs are considered visible in totality even though the associated wireless communication antenna and/or equipment building or cabinet may not be easily discernible. 
(2)  Eight-foot-high fencing shall be provided around any communication tower and associated equipment building or cabinet. Concertina wire, barbed wire, or other like security devices are expressly prohibited unless the devices are screened entirely and year round with landscaping that achieves the required screening at the time the landscaping is installed. Any existing concertina wire, barbed wire, or other like security fencing shall he either removed within one year of the date of adoption of this amendment to the zoning ordinance or screened entirely and year round with landscaping that achieves the required screening at the time the landscaping is installed. 
(3)  Around the base of any communication tower, outside of the fencing, at least one row of evergreen shrubs forming a continuous hedge at least five feet in height shall be provided, with individual plantings spaced not more than five feet apart. Additional landscaping, to include that associated with parking, is to be provided as required by all other relevant provisions of this article. 
(4)  Illumination. WCFs shall be illuminated only to the extent required by applicable federal or state statute or regulation. 
(5)  Signage. No signage is permitted, except: 
a.  As is required by applicable state or federal law, rule, or regulation; 
b.  As is required by standard industry practice for the purpose of identification, warning, emergency function or contact; and 
(6)  Stealth WCFs that serve as or provide a public amenity may have up to six square feet of signage only for the purpose of dedication and/or announcing corporate sponsorship. 
(7)  Abandonment. A WCF and equipment that is no longer used for communication purposes must be removed within 120 days of the date it is taken out of service. 
(8)  Permit required. A zoning permit is required prior to the beginning of any site work or WCF construction. 
(9)  Color. New communication towers shall be light gray, except as otherwise required by applicable federal or state statute or regulation. 
(10)  Fall zone letter required. A new communication tower, a new stealth communication WCF, or the support structure necessary to increase the height of an existing structure by more than 20 feet must be designed such that, in the event the WCF may fail structurally, it would not fall within a public right-of-way. The zoning administrator or his or her designee shall not issue a zoning permit for the support structures listed within this subsection until such time that the applicant provides a signed letter from a registered professional structural engineer certifying that the proposed WCF is designed as required above. 
(11)  Relocation of a WCF. Any WCF permitted in the public right-of-way shall be relocated at the expense of the WCF's owner in the event relocation is required due to roadway or utility improvements. 
(12)  Locations on city property or right-of-way. Nothing in this section abrogates the city's discretion to deny the use of city property or right-of-ways. The city, in its proprietary capacity, retains the discretion to reject or allow. 
(13)  Expansion of nonconformity. Notwithstanding section 17-201 et seq., which regulates nonconformities, no WCF proposed upon an existing structure permitted in accordance with Table 3 shall be construed to expand or otherwise exacerbate an existing nonconformity. 
(14)  No variance to the requirements of this section shall be granted by BOZA.

Application for amendment to establish a PUD district shall be subject to the provisions of division 4 of this article, and in addition, the procedures described in this subsection shall apply. It is the intent of this article that the public interest will be served not only by consideration of those specific criteria set forth in this section, but also by consideration of the total anticipated effect of the planned unit development upon the community at large. The provisions of the PUD district represent a relaxation of specific site design requirements as applied to other districts provided for in this article, and in return for the design flexibility granted thereby, the applicant for amendment to PUD district classification, by requesting the PUD designation and making application therefor, shall agree to furnish information about the proposed development, and later to abide by certain conditions and safeguards as may be imposed by the city council in establishing such developments. To that end, the regulations set forth in this section are minimum requirements, and it is the intent of this article that the city council may impose conditions and safeguards in excess of, or in addition to, the specific requirements set forth in this section, and that guarantee of meeting the minimum requirements set forth in this section does not per se create an indication that an applicant should be entitled to such an amendment, and notice is hereby given to that effect. 
b.  Pre-application conference. The applicant is encouraged to communicate his intentions to establish a planned unit development, and the proposed characteristics thereof, to the planning commission staff prior to initiating an application or amendment in order to avoid undue delay in the review process after initiating such application, and in order to facilitate review of materials which may be in preliminary form, and in order to avoid unnecessary expense in preparation of materials in final form which may later be found to be unacceptable or incomplete.

The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(5)  Conical surface means a surface extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(6)  Conical zone. The conical zone is established on the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom for a distance of 4,000 feet and upward at a slope of 20:1. 
(7)  Hazard to navigation means an obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. 
(8)  Height. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this section and shown on the zoning map, the term "the datum" shall mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
(9)  Horizontal surface means a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plane coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone. 
(10)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(11)  Obstruction means any structure, growth or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limited height set forth in this section. 
(12)  Primary surface means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is 250 feet. 
(13)  Runway means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
(14)  Structure means an object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including but not limited to buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines. 
(15)  Transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward at right angles (90-degree angles) to the runway centerline and extend at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal surfaces. 
(16)  Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(b)  Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained and no trees shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this section to a height in excess of the applicable height limitations established in this section for each zone in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zone, -APA: Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Transitional zones, -APT: Slopes seven feet horizontally for each foot upward beginning at the side of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation or 344 feet above mean sea level. In addition, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending to where they intersect the horizontal surface. 
(3)  Horizontal zone, -APH: Established at 150 feet above the airport at an elevation of 344 feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone, -APC: Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to an elevation of 544 feet above mean sea level. 
(c)  Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this section in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
(d)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and is diligently pursued. 
(2)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the county. 
(e)  Permits. The zoning administrator shall not issue a zoning permit within an -APA, -APH, -APT or -APC area until it has been determined that the proposal upon which he is requested to act is in compliance with the terms of this article. 
(1)  Required; exceptions. Except as specifically provided in subsections (e)(1)a, b and c of this section, no material changes shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created by this section unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient detail to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this section. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (e)(4) of this section. 
a.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
b.  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet in vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
c.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the elevation prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of these exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits established by this section as set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived or the effective date of any amendments to this section, or than it is when the application for such a permit shall be granted. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 75 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(4)  Variances. 
a.  Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section, may apply to the board of zoning appeals for a variance from such regulations. 
b.  The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this section. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this section may be considered by the board of zoning appeals unless a copy of this application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of zoning appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application. 
(5)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effect the purpose of this section and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of zoning appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the county, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

Sec. 17-308. - -FW and -FP flood protection areas. 
(a)  Designations supplementary. The -FW and -FP designations are not intended to be utilized as district classifications, but as designations which identify areas subject to regulations which are supplementary to the regulations of the district to which such designations are attached, appended or overlaid. Regulations which apply to areas designated on the zoning map as being within such appended or overlaid designations must be determined by joint reference to the regulations of both the basic district classification and the appended or overlay classification. 
(b)  Definitions. Definitions of the terms used in this section can be found in section 17-55. 
(c)  Regulation of floodway areas. 
(1)  Designation on zoning map. Areas classified as floodway areas are designated by the notation "-FW" appended to a district classification on the zoning map. 
(2)  Filling. Filling of floodway areas, dumping of salvaged or scrap material or other placing of material or obstructions within a floodway area in such a manner as to impede free flow of water during time of flood or in such a manner that the elevation of floodwaters will be increased is prohibited, except that the city engineer may issue a permit specifically authorizing such filling and prescribing the location of material to be placed within the floodway and limiting the elevation of the finished grade of such material.

Permitted accessory structures, prohibited uses and structures, minimum lot area, minimum lot width, minimum yard requirements, maximum lot coverage, maximum height of structures, minimum off-street parking and loading, and regulation of signs shall be as provided for the basic district to which the -FW designation is appended, unless a greater requirement is placed upon such dimensions and characteristics of use by this section. 
(d)  Regulation of floodplain areas. 
(1)  Designation on zoning map. Areas classified as floodplain areas are designated by the notation "-FP" appended to a district classification on the zoning map. 
(2)  Protection from flood hazards. All structures hereafter erected within areas designated as floodplain areas shall be protected from flood hazards as follows: 
a.  Filling. Acceptable protection may be filling of building sites to an elevation of not less than one foot above the regulatory flood level as established by the city engineer, with such elevation extending not less than 25 feet outward from the base of the structure. This method of protection is referred to in this section as "filling" or "on fill," and such terms include the specifications given in this subsection. 
b.  Elevation on pilings. Acceptable protection may be accomplished by erecting structures on pilings or other structural members such that the floor level of the structure is not less than two feet above the regulatory flood protection elevation as established by the city engineer, and such that service facilities such as electrical circuits and installed electrical appliances are not less than one foot above the regulatory flood level as established by the city engineer. 
c.  Floodproofing. Acceptable protection may be accomplished by floodproofing following such methods as approved by the city engineer as generally set forth in subsection (e)(8) of this section. 
(3)  Review of proposed uses by city engineer. All applications for zoning permits for uses permitted within -FP areas shall be reviewed by the city engineer in accordance with subsection (e) of this section before the zoning administrator may issue zoning permits or before the board of zoning appeals may grant a special exception. The findings and recommendations of the city engineer shall be binding upon the zoning administrator and upon the board of zoning appeals. 
(4)  Permitted uses. Any use permitted outright or permitted as an accessory use in the basic district to which the -FP designation is appended is permitted, provided that such uses are located on fill or are elevated on pilings. 
(5)  Permissible special exceptions. 
a.  Any use which is permitted outright or permitted as an accessory use in the basic district to which the -FP designation is appended is a permissible special exception if such uses are not located on fill and are not elevated on pilings, provided that such uses, if not otherwise protected, shall be floodproofed. 
b.  Any use which is permitted as a special exception in the basic district to which the -FP designation is appended is a permissible special exception, provided that such uses shall be either on fill, elevated on pilings or floodproofed. 
(e)  Review of proposed uses by city engineer. 
(1)  Required. As provided in this section, the following require review and certification by the city engineer of findings to either the zoning administrator or the board of zoning appeals as appropriate: 
a.  Filling in -FW areas in connection with permissible uses or as a use in itself; 
b.  All special exceptions within -FW areas; 
c.  All uses permissible in -FP areas; and 
d.  All special exceptions in -FP areas. 
(2)  General standards. When reviewing applications for filling permits, zoning permits and special exceptions, the city engineer should take into account the following considerations and review the following factors: 
a.  No structure, storage of materials or equipment, filling or other use should be approved which, acting alone or in combination with existing or future uses, will significantly increase the hazard of flood damage to other land or property. 
b.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocity or erosion damage shall be considered. 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others shall be considered. 
d.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions shall be considered. 
e.  The relationship of the proposed use to the floodplain management program for the area shall be considered. 
f.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles shall be considered. 
g.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site shall be considered. 
(3)  Filling, grading, excavating or dredging. When reviewing applications for actions including filling, grading, excavating or dredging, the following considerations should be reviewed: 
a.  The proposed activity should be permitted only if it will not seriously disturb or interfere with natural drainage and will not significantly increase the elevation of floodwaters. 
b.  The city engineer may require information for review relating to topographic, engineering, geologic or hydrologic features to determine the nature, strength and distribution of existing and proposed soils and the adequacy of design criteria. 
c.  The city engineer may recommend or attach conditions to the approval of applications pertaining to final slope and grade, period of ground cover removal, bulkheading, construction of retaining walls, riprapping, landscaping, drainage facilities, reconstruction of natural storm drainage features and other matters. 
d.  Fill used for building sites should consist of sand, gravel or other sand foundation material which will retain its structural bearing capacity under saturated conditions. Silts, very fine sands, clays, peat and other high organic soils subject to compaction or erosion should not be used. Where mud, peat or silt is not removed before placement of fill, additional fill should be required to protect against settlement. Where water erosion is likely to occur, fill should be protected by bulkheads, riprap, planting of vegetation or other protective measures. 
(4)  Flood control works. When reviewing applications for actions relating to the construction of flood controls or erosion control structures, the city engineer should consider the following factors, among others: 
a.  All work should be designed to provide a degree of protection consistent with the intended use of the property. 
b.  No work should be permitted which will damage the subject or adjoining properties. 
c.  Fill and other material for flood or erosion control should be protected as described in subsection (e)(3)d of this section. 
(5)  Buildings. When reviewing applications for actions relating to buildings, the city engineer should consider the following factors, among others: 
a.  Buildings should be designed with low flood damage potential. 
b.  Buildings should be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. 
c.  Structures should be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures. 
d.  Service facilities such as electrical equipment, circuits, heating and cooling equipment, and appliances should be constructed above the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area or should be floodproofed. 
(6)  Storage of materials and equipment. When reviewing applications for action relating to the storage of materials and equipment, the city engineer should consider the following factors, among others: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that in time of flooding are flammable, explosive, or similarly hazardous or injurious should be prohibited. 
b.  Other materials or equipment stored in areas subject to flooding should not be subject to major damage by flooding and should be firmly anchored to prevent flotation or readily removable from the area within the time normally available after flood warning. 
(7)  Use of floodproofing. When reviewing applications for actions relating to the floodproofing of structures, the city engineer should consider the following factors, among others: 
a.  Structural floodproofing should not ordinarily be allowed for residences. 
b.  Structural floodproofing of nonresidential structures should be considered as acceptable flood protection only when it appears that construction of buildings on fill or elevation of buildings on pilings is impractical. 
(8)  Methods of floodproofing. The following measures are considered as appropriate to floodproofing, and these and other measures should be considered by the city engineer when reviewing applications for actions related to floodproofing. These measures should be designed to be consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. 
a.  Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement; 
b.  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters or similar methods of construction to protect against water damage; 
c.  Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures; 
d.  Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls; 
e.  Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation; 
f.  Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures; 
g.  Construction of water supply and waste systems so as to prevent the entrance of floodwaters; 
h.  Pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface drainage systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood pressures; 
i.  Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris; 
j.  Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and stormwater into the buildings or structures. Gravity drainage of basements may be eliminated by mechanical devices; 
k.  Location of all electrical equipment, circuits and installed electrical appliances in a manner which will ensure that they are not subject to flooding and to provide protection from inundation by the regulatory flood; and 
l.  Location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids or other toxic materials which will ensure that the facilities are situated at elevations above the height associated with the regulatory protection elevation or are adequately floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage containers or damage to storage containers which could result in the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters. 
(9)  Report to zoning administrator or board of adjustment. Upon completion of review of applications for zoning permits or special exceptions, the city engineer shall certify his findings to the zoning administrator or board of zoning appeals as appropriate, and such certification shall be made within 30 days of receipt of all required materials. The requirements of the city engineer shall be binding upon the zoning administrator and upon the board of zoning appeals.

Properties containing dwelling units within a mixed-use structure (e.g. ground-floor commercial with apartments within the upper floors) are excluded from this definition. Vacant property zoned residentially is excluded from this definition, as parking upon such property would be considered a principal use and subject to section 17-258, Table of permitted uses.

Parking spaces located within either the primary or secondary front yard shall be nine feet wide by 20 feet deep, except upon property used for detached one-family and two-family where the size of a parking space may be reduced to eight feet wide by 16 feet deep. 
(e)  Arrangement of parking spaces. Parking space and driveway configurations, except where the property is used for detached one-family, attached one-family, townhouses, and two-family, shall be so designed that vehicles are not required to back onto or maneuver in the public right-of-way. Tandem parking spaces are permitted only upon property used for detached one-family and two-family.

Sec. 17-323. - Interim measures for community character protection. 
(a)  Creation of overlay district and application of interim measures for community character protection. 
(1)  The -CC overlay district is intended to minimize the possibility that demolition and construction activity within a residential community would drastically negatively affect the existing character of that community. Also, it is intended that this district be established for a period of time only long enough for that community to determine whether or not a historic or design protection overlay district is appropriate. 
(2)  The -CC designation and the associated interim measures for community character protection are not intended to be utilized as a stand-alone zoning district classification, but as a set of regulations which are overlaid and supplemental to the regulations of the existing zoning district. 
(3)  The interim measures provided for in this ordinance shall apply to property zoned or used residentially for a period of two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, or until such time as city council votes to grant or deny a request for a historic or a design preservation overlay district for that geographic area. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection 17-132(b), only a member of city council may initiate an amendment to the zoning map to overlay these interim measures to other geographic areas, and the interim measures shall apply to property zoned or used residentially for a period of two years from the effective date of the ordinance applying the interim measures to the particular geographic area. 
(5)  In conjunction with an application for a historic or design preservation overlay district for a geographic area within the two-year periods provided hereinabove, the zoning administrator shall also initiate a text and map amendment to remove the interim measures for that particular geographic area. 
(b)  Limits to demolition. 
(1)  The city shall not issue a demolition or relocation permit for any structure 50 years old or more within any geographic area to which these interim measures for community character protection apply without prior review and approval by the design development review commission (DDRC) unless the structure is deemed "noncontributing" in accordance with subsection 17-655(a)(2) by city staff. City staff may review and approve the demolition or relocation of a structure deemed "noncontributing" in accordance with subsection 17-655(a)(2). 
(2)  The age of a structure shall be established by the records maintained by the Richland County Assessor's Office. If the age of the structure cannot be established by the records maintained by the Richland County Assessor's Office, the applicant for a demolition or relocation permit shall present other documentation to the city to establish the age of the structure. 
(3)  Where prior review and approval by the DDRC is required, the applicant for a demolition or relocation permit shall submit an application for certificate of design approval to the DDRC. 
(4)  The property upon which the structure is located shall be posted with notice of the application to demolish or relocate at least 15 days prior to the consideration of the application by the DDRC. 
(5)  For applications to demolish a structure, the DDRC shall apply the criteria for review of requests for demolition permits as set forth in subsection 17-674(e). 
(6)  For applications to relocate a structure, the DDRC shall apply the Guidelines for Relocation as published by the DDRC. 
(7)  If an application for a demolition or relocation is denied, the applicant may appeal to city council pursuant to section 17-677. 
(8)  The following demolitions are exempt from this section: 
a.  Partial demolitions where city staff determines that the portion of structure to be demolished does not contribute to the design integrity of the structure or the character of the structure. 
b.  Demolitions ordered by the city to remedy a life or safety issue. 
c.  Demolitions ordered by the city as a conclusion of a property maintenance or housing code case. 
d.  Demolition requested within an application to rezone the property to PUD and the application for a PUD is approved by city council.

Any person demolishing or relocating without a permit or certificate of design approval as required by the provisions of this section shall be subject to the penalties provided for in section 17-656. 
(c)  Limits upon new construction and subdivisions. 
(1)  Side yard setbacks. Within any geographic area to which these interim measures for community character protection apply, the side yard setbacks for a newly subdivided residential lot shall be the mean side yard setback for all improved residential lots within a 750-foot radius, except that: 
a.  Side yard setbacks for newly subdivided residential lots subdivided from a corner lot shall be determined pursuant to subsections (2), (3) or (4) below. 
b.  Side yard setbacks shall not reduce the width of a building pad upon a newly subdivided residential lot to less than 30 feet in width. 
c.  Side yard setbacks upon a newly subdivided residential lot shall not be less than five feet unless reduced by an approved PUD or variance. 
(2)  Subdivisions of improved corner lots. Within any geographic area to which these interim measures for community character protection apply, the following shall apply to an application to subdivide a new residential lot from an improved corner lot: 
a.  If the application for subdivision seeks to orient a structure perpendicular to the existing structure located upon the "remaining" corner lot, no new lot line shall be closer to the existing structure than 30 feet. Covered or enclosed landings, porches, or patios incidental to the structure and less than 75 square feet gross floor area may encroach into this 30-foot setback. (See Figure 1) 

b.  If the application for subdivision seeks to orient a structure in the substantially same orientation as the existing structure located upon the "remaining" corner lot, the front yard setback of the new lot shall be the same as the same street setback of the existing structure upon the "remaining" corner lot. (See Figure 2) 
c.  Side yard setbacks shall be established pursuant to subsection 1 above. (See Figure 2) 

(3)  Subdivisions of vacant corner lots. Within any geographic area to which these interim measures for community character protection apply, the following shall apply to an application to subdivide a new residential lot from a vacant corner lot (See Figure 3): 
a.  The subdivision shall be platted so the structure built upon the "remaining" corner lot has setbacks from both street lot lines that align with the existing setbacks of existing structures in each direction. 
b.  The street setback for any new "interior" lot shall align with the existing setback of an existing adjacent structure. If no adjacent structure exists to establish the street setback, or if the street setback of an existing structure is atypical for the area, the street setback shall be determined by the average of all similarly oriented street setbacks along the same street within a two-block radius. 
c.  Side yard setbacks shall be established pursuant to subsection (1) above. 

(4)  Subdivisions of corner lots, generally. The zoning administrator may require a different orientation or setback than that required by this ordinance or by section 17-275, 17-276, or 17-278 if a different orientation or setback would further the intent of these interim measures, or where such orientation would preserve a grand and/or significant tree. The applicant for subdivision may appeal this determination to the board of zoning appeals as an appeal from an administrative decision of the zoning administrator. 
(5)  Height considerations. Within any geographic area to which these interim measures for community character protection apply, any structure constructed upon a newly subdivided residential lot which is contiguous to a lot upon which a structure one and one-half stories high or less exists shall be no higher than a line drawn at a 45-degree angle from a point eight feet above the common lot line or than the maximum allowance within the underlying zoning district, whichever is less. These provisions shall not apply to chimneys and other unoccupied appurtenances attached to the structure. (See Figure 4) 

(6)  Newly subdivided residential lot. For the purpose of this ordinance, "newly subdivided residential lot" shall mean any residential lot created by a plat of subdivision filed and recorded after the effective date of this ordinance upon which no more than a single-family or two-family dwelling can be constructed.

Where a property does not have the area available to provide off-street parking spaces because of existing conditions that were lawful at the time of establishment (e.g. an existing building covers the entire parcel), those nonresidential uses listed upon Table 1 of section 17-258 with an off-street parking requirement equivalent to three parking spaces for each 1,000 square feet of gross floor area or less or those retail trade uses listed upon Table 1 of section 17-258 within or under SIC category number 53 General merchandise stores, 54 Food stores, 56 Apparel and accessory stores, 57 Furniture, and 59 Miscellaneous retail shall only be required to provide as many off-street parking spaces as may physically fit upon the property. 
(b)  Remote parking. Where the off-street parking spaces required by this section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal nonresidential use would be located: 
(1)  Such space may be provided on any land within 600 feet of the principal use provided that the owner or authorized agent for the land upon which such remote parking is located shall restrict the use of such parking area for parking only in connection with the use or structure for which such remote parking is provided. Such restriction shall be recorded by a declaration of restrictions filed with the Office of the Register of Deeds for Richland County or Lexington County, which may be released only by the written consent of city council. Remote parking for nonresidential uses shall not be established within any residential district except in accordance with the provisions of section 17-344(a)(3). 
(2)  Such space may be leased subject to the approval of a special exception by the board of zoning appeals and subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Notices required of section 17-112 shall include both the location of the prospective use and the property containing the leased parking spaces; 
b.  At the time of application for special exception, each prospective user shall provide a copy of an unexecuted lease for a number of off-street parking spaces at a rate specified upon Table 1 of section 17-258, and the number of parking spaces required will be rounded to the nearest whole number; 
c.  The lease must specify that the parking spaces are for the exclusive use of the prospective user, including the user's customers and employees, unless the parking spaces are controlled by the City of Columbia; 
d.  The lease must state that no party can cancel the lease without first sending notice via certified mail to the Zoning Administrator, c/o the Zoning Division of the City of Columbia, at least 30 days prior to the termination of the lease; 
e.  With the application for special exception, the applicant shall provide a site plan to scale depicting the location of the prospective use, the location of the parking spaces, and the pedestrian path of travel between these locations. The board of zoning appeals shall find that the location of the parking spaces and the associated pedestrian path of travel are safe and well lit; 
f.  Parking spaces shall be located on parcels within 600 feet of the property containing the prospective use; 
g.  Parking spaces shall not include required off-street parking spaces for another use, except in accordance with section 17-346, shared parking; 
h.  For the purposes of this subsection, section 17-345 (b), the term "lease" may include some other similar type of binding contractual arrangement between a user and a property owner, subject to compliance with all other conditions of the grant of special exception; 
i.  At the time of application for zoning approval (request coming from either a business license application or other similar application for zoning permit), each prospective user shall provide a copy of an executed lease identical to the unexecuted lease provided to the board of zoning appeals and in conformance with any additional conditions imposed by the board of zoning appeals; 
j.  Prior to operating the use, each parking space shall be clearly marked that the space is reserved for the exclusive use of the user, and that the user may cause violators to be towed; 
k.  Each parking space marking shall not exceed two square feet and shall be free of logos or other commercial contents; and 
l.  At the time of every annual renewal for a business license, each user shall submit evidence that the lease submitted in support of the grant of special exception is currently in effect and has been in effect since the last date of zoning approval (i.e. initial zoning approval or last annual business license renewal). 
(c)  Residential facilities intended for occupancy by the elderly. The board of adjustment may, as a special exception, after notice and hearing, and subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, grant a reduction in off-street parking requirements of not more than 50 percent of that generally required for residential facilities intended for occupancy by the elderly, provided that adequate land is available for future expansion to accommodate the generally required amount of parking and that the site design of such reduced parking area will facilitate future expansion if such is required. 
(d)  Industrial, processing, storage, warehousing, distribution or wholesaling uses. The board of adjustment may, as a special exception, after notice and hearing, and subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, grant a reduction in the amount of parking required for industrial, processing, storage, warehousing, distribution or wholesaling uses located in C-4, M-1 or M-2 districts if such action appears to be reasonably justified as based upon employment levels and characteristics of operation of such uses. 
(e)  Drive-in facilities other than eating and drinking establishments. The board of adjustment may, as a special exception, after notice and hearing, and subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, grant a reduction of not more than 50 percent in the generally required off-street parking for facilities offering drive-in service to customers or patrons, provided that: 
(1)  The applicant for such special exception demonstrates that the installation of drive-in facilities will reduce customer or patron parking requirements in direct ratio to the number of off-street parking spaces proposed to be eliminated. 
(2)  Adequate off-street parking will remain to accommodate employees. 
(f)  High-rise apartments in C-4 districts. The board of adjustment may, as a special exception, after notice and hearing, and subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, grant a reduction in required parking for high-rise apartments located in C-4 districts to not less than one space per dwelling unit. 
(g)  Required improvements. Off-street parking areas developed to meet minimum requirements of this article, and all off-street parking facilities located within the C-4 central commercial area district and C-5 central business district, shall be within properly graded, marked and improved parking lots or within parking structures. 
(h)  College or university public dormitories. Parking for public dormitories may be located on land owned by the college or university regardless of the distance from the principal use. Such parking shall be improved to meet all applicable parking lot standards, and not be located in a residential zoning district. Parking located more than 600 feet from the lot where the principal use is located shall be served by a transit system. Transit shelters shall be provided to protect riders from the elements, and include security lighting, emergency call boxes, and security cameras. A real time locator feature to inform riders of the bus location shall be provided. Hours of transit operation shall factor in ultimate ridership and include weekend and after hours service if there is a demand.

Sec. 17-346. - Shared parking. 
    Shared parking should be encouraged in mixed use developments which include at least two uses that have different parking demand peaking characteristics. The actual reduction for such a project should be determined through a comprehensive analysis of parking demands by time of day.

based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Tucson, Arizona - 1990; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Ft. Worth, Texas - 2004; Kennedale, Texas - 2005; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Jackson County, Missouri - 2008; Louisville, Kentucky - 2004; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); Dallas, Texas - 2007; "Rural Hotspots: The Case of Adult Businesses," 19 Criminal Justice Policy Review 153 (2008); and "Correlates of Current Transactional Sex among a Sample of Female Exotic Dancers in Baltimore, MD," Journal of Urban Health (2011), 
the city council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this division, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this division are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
    The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

Sec. 17-408-17-410. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 13. - LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 17-411. - Purpose, intent and applicability. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Recognizing that trees and landscaping contribute to the public health, safety and welfare, the City of Columbia has set standards for landscaping and screening in the city. Among the benefits of trees, shrubs, and other plants are: improved air quality; beneficial climate modification; reduction of glare, noise, odors and dust; reduction of stormwater runoff and flooding; screening of undesirable views; provision of buffers between incompatible land uses; shelter and food for birds and other wildlife; the psychological benefits of experiencing nature in the city; the aesthetic enjoyment provided by the diversity and dynamism of the planted landscape. All of these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life, enhancing the appeal and economic value of both residential and business properties in the city. 
    The intent of these requirements, as set forth in this division, is to provide for landscaping between dissimilar uses (buffer transition yards), along public rights-of-way (street protective yards), and within and around parking lots and other vehicular surface areas. Screening for loading, trash collection, display, and utility areas is required; and minimum tree density standards, along with tree protection standards to preserve existing grand and other protected trees, must be met for all developments to which this division applies. To ensure that the landscaping continues to thrive and enhance the quality of life in the City of Columbia, requirements for maintenance are also included. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  General requirements. When a zoning permit is applied for within the City of Columbia, the permit applicant must present a Landscape plan (section 17-412) and must comply with the pertinent requirements of the following sections: Single-family residential subdivisions (section 17-413); Buffer transition yards (section 17-417); Street protective yards (section 17-418); Vehicular surface area interior landscaping (section 17-419); Screening (section 17-420); and Required density factor for the site (section 17-422). See also section 17-421, Protection of existing trees during development. Even when a zoning permit has not been applied for, see Article VII, Divisions 3 and 4, for tree protection and preservation requirements. 
Any violation of the regulations set forth in any of these divisions shall be a violation of the zoning regulations for the City of Columbia and subject to all penalties and remedies set forth in Article III, Division 13, section 17-424 and Article VII, Division 3, section 17-816 of this chapter. 
See general applicability in subsections immediately below; in addition, see the pertinent sections covered later in this chapter. 
(2)  Exemptions. These requirements shall not apply to: 
a.  Lots zoned for single-family detached dwellings. The initial development of a subdivision of single-family or two-family homes is subject to the tree protection (section 17-421) requirements for trees that have been identified to meet the required density factor for the site (section 17-422). See section 17-413, single-family residential subdivisions. 
b.  Public and private utilities, except when a zoning permit or subdivision approval is required. Such utilities may include but are not limited to storm drainage installation, street construction, water and sewer construction, and electric, gas, communications and other similar service installations. 
c.  Improvements to existing structures if there is an expansion of less than 25 percent of the total gross floor area of the building and/or an expansion of less than 25 percent of the vehicular surface area. 
d.  Improvements to existing structures if there is a renovation/reuse (not a more intense use) that is valued at less than 50 percent or more of the existing recorded tax value of the building. 
Note: A vacant lot shall be treated as if in the highest category for which it is zoned. For example, if the lot is zoned residential, a transitional buffer yard is required for an adjacent commercial or industrial development. 
(3)  Full compliance. See also section 17-411(b)(4), partial compliance, below. 
a.  Any new development other than those exempted in (2), above, must fully comply with the requirements set forth in the following sections: Landscape plan (section 17-412) Single-family residential subdivisions (Sec. 17-413); Buffer transition yards (Sec. 17-417); Street protective yards (Sec. 17-418); Vehicular surface area interior landscaping (Sec. 17-419); Screening for loading areas, trash collection areas, display areas and utility service areas (Sec. 17-420); Required density factor for the site (Sec. 17-422); and Protection of existing trees during development (Sec. 17-421). 
b.  Any existing structure for which a zoning permit has been applied for a change of use to a more intense use must fully comply with the requirements for Buffer transition yards (Sec. 17-417) and Screening (Sec. 17-420); any new, additional or expanded portions of vehicular surface areas must fully comply with Street protective yard requirements for vehicular surface areas (Sec. 17-418) and with Vehicular surface area interior landscaping requirements (Sec. 17-419). 
c.

d.  Any existing structure for which there is a renovation/reuse (not a more intense use) that is valued at 50 percent or more of the existing recorded tax value of the building, must meet 100 percent of the requirements for screening (section 17-420) and in any new, additional or expanded vehicular surface areas, 100 percent of the requirements for street protective yards (section 17-418) and for vehicular surface area interior landscaping (section 17-419). 
e.  Any existing vehicular surface that is used to satisfy the parking requirements for a new building must fully comply with street protective yards (section 17-418) for vehicular surface areas and vehicular surface area interior landscaping (section 17-419). 
(4)  Partial compliance for certain expansions or renovations. See also section 17-411(b)(3), Full compliance, above. Notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth below or in any other section of this chapter, no buffer transition yard (section 17-4174) shall at any point have a width measuring less than ten feet, no existing buffer yard shall be reduced in size from its existing width, and no street protective yard (section 17-418) shall at any point have a width of less than five feet. 
Partial compliance, as set forth below, is required in either of the following types of development: 1) any existing structure for which there is an expansion that, singularly or collectively, equals 25 percent or more of the gross floor area of an existing building and/or 25 percent or more of the existing vehicular surface area, or 2) any existing structure for which there is a renovation/reuse (not a more intense use) that is valued at 50 percent or more of the existing recorded tax value of the building. 
a.  Fifty percent of the buffer transition yard (section 17-417) requirements. This reduction applies both to the width of the yard and to the quantities of required shrubs. 
b.  A street protective yard (section 17-418) for the entire property that is no less than the length of the property adjacent to the right-of-way times five feet (and shall not at any point be less than five feet in width). 
c.  Fifty percent or more of the Vehicular surface area interior (section 17-419) planting requirements for any existing vehicular surface area. See full compliance, subsection (3)c., above, for new parking areas. 
d.  Screening (section 17-420) for any new locations for trash collection, loading, or display areas. 
(5)  Parking reductions to facilitate compliance in existing developments. In order to facilitate compliance in situations involving expansion, renovation/reuse and change of use of existing developments, the zoning administrator may allow up to a ten percent reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces. The board of zoning appeals must determine whether any further reductions may be allowed, provided that the reductions will not create on-street parking congestion. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-412. - Landscape plan, tree inventory and survey requirements. 
(a)  Plan to be submitted with zoning permit application. Prior to obtaining a zoning permit, an applicant must receive approval of a landscape plan, which shall be submitted with the zoning permit application. The landscape plan must contain all information necessary to show that the planned use, structure, or development complies with the standards set forth in this division and must conform to the standards for landscape plans set forth in the administrative guidelines. This shall include utility and irrigation plans, if applicable, any required tree survey or tree inventory, and any required tree protection plans. See single-family residential subdivisions (section 17-413) and section 17-422, Required density factor for the site. 
(b)  Commercial developments or subdivisions. The initial development of commercial properties is subject to all landscaping requirements and specifically to the landscape plan, preservation plan, tree inventory and survey requirements as set forth below.

(1)  Proposed multi-family projects of ten or fewer units must submit a tree inventory of all trees of 12-inch or greater DBH, a tree preservation plan, and a landscape plan for review and approval. 
(2)  Proposed multi-family projects of 11 or more units must submit a tree survey of all trees of 12-inch or greater DBH, a tree preservation plan, and a landscape plan for review and approval. 
(3)  As part of the zoning permit process, a tree inventory or survey, a tree preservation plan, and a landscape plan must be reviewed and approved by the zoning administrator or his designee. 
(d)  Approval. Issuance of a valid zoning permit shall be contingent upon approval by the land development planner of the required landscape plan and shall indicate conformance to the provisions of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-413. - Single-family residential subdivisions and required density factor for the site (DFS). 
(a)  General. All single-family residential subdivisions must comply with a required density factor (section 17-422) for the site of 20 units per acre. This requirement may be met as an average for the total acreage of each phase of the subdivision development, rather than for each individual acre. Trees may be retained or planted along the street right-of-way, as edge plantings along a development's perimeter, in entranceways, or in common open space. Emphasis shall be placed upon retaining grand trees. 
(b)  Tree protection. All existing trees to be counted towards meeting the density factor for the site must comply with protection of existing trees during development (section 17-421). 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-414. - Credit for existing vegetation. 
    Existing vegetation in good health that meets the requirements set forth in the pertinent subsections (buffer yards, street protective yards vehicular surface areas, etc.), may be used to satisfy these planting requirements, provided that all tree protection standards are met. (See section 17-421 for "fair or better condition" tree criteria and for tree protection standards. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-415. - Planting specifications. 
(a)  Species. Trees, shrubs and other vegetative material shall be selected from those listed in the administrative guidelines or shall be approved by the zoning administrator. Plants shall be adapted to the site conditions where they will be planted. Please refer to the administrative guidelines for more detailed plant and materials specifications. 
(b)  Trees. See section 17-55, Definitions, for tree classifications. 
(1)  Size. All shade trees planted in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be a minimum of ten feet in height, and small-maturing trees a minimum of eight feet in height, when planted. Both shade trees and small-maturing trees must be two inches in caliper (measured one-half foot above ground level) when planted. Any new trees of above four-inch caliper size shall be measured 12 inches above the ground. 
(2)  Spread relationship. The height-to-trunk caliper ratio, root ball sizes, or spread relationship for any tree to be planted shall meet the current "American Standards for Nursery Stock" as set forth by the American Association of Nurserymen.

(c)  Shrubs. All shrubs planted to meet the requirements of this section, unless required to be larger, as set forth in later subsections such as "Screening, vehicular surface areas," etc., shall be a minimum of three-gallon container size and 18 inches in height or spread (depending on whether the growth habit is upright or spreading) measured from the top of the root zone. 
(d)  Mulch. All planted materials are to be mulched with an approved material in the amount (depth and area) specified in the guidelines. Generally, an organic material such as bark mulch or pine straw shall be applied as follows: for trees and shrubs, three to four inches deep at the base of shrubs and trees from the trunk to the dripline; for ground cover and perennials, one to two inches deep sufficient in coverage to conserve moisture and suppress weeds without inhibiting growth of the landscape plants. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-416. - Alternative compliance; Columbia landscaping and tree fund. 
(a)  Alternative landscaping plans or plant materials may be used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application of the landscaping requirements. Such situations may result from streams, natural rock formations, topography, lot configuration, utility easements, or from other unusual site conditions. The alternative compliance committee, comprised of the zoning administrator, the land development planner, and the planning director, must approve such alternatives. 
(b)  Alternative compliance shall not be interpreted as a means to remove a grand tree. 
(c)  The alternative compliance committee may approve an alternate plan that proposes a different, creative design solution provided that the design meets the standards of quality, effectiveness, durability and performance (the spirit and intent) required by this division. 
(d)  The zoning administrator shall review the performance of alternate landscaping plans. The purpose of this review shall be to determine if the alternate plan meets the intent and purpose of this division. This determination shall take into account the land use of adjacent property; the amount and species of plant material; its arrangement and coverage of the lot; the level of screening; and the mature height, spread and canopy of the plantings. 
(e)  Decisions of the zoning administrator or the alternative compliance committee regarding alternate methods of compliance may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals. 
(f)  In the event that certain constraints, such as those listed in (a) above, make it impossible for the development to comply with the landscaping requirements, the unmet requirements must be compensated for via payment to the Columbia Landscaping and Tree Fund of 125 percent of the estimated cost of plant materials and installation. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-417. - Buffer transition yards. 
(a)  Purpose, definition and applicability 
(1)  Purpose and definition. The buffer transition yard is a landscaped area designed to provide separation and screening between land uses of different intensities. The required land area and the specified type of screening for each buffer transition yard are designed to buffer the effects of traffic, noise, glare, trash, activity, vibration, odor, visual disorder, and any other harmful or noxious effect associated with a more intensive use. Buffer transition yard regulations are also intended to prevent an adverse community appearance, to protect the character of an area and to conserve the values of buildings and land. 
(2)  Applicability. See section 17-411(b). 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  General. Buffer transition yards are to be located on the property of the proposed or changing land use that is to be screened. Such transition yards are to be located between the property line and any vehicular use areas, buildings, storage, service areas or other areas of activity on the property to be screened and shall extend along the entire property line abutting the less intensive land use. Ornamental entry columns and gates, flagpoles, lamp or address posts, mailboxes, approved driveway openings, public utility wires and poles, fences, retaining walls or similar structures are permitted in required buffer transition yards, provided that the general separation of land uses is achieved and that the total number of required plantings are still met. Plantings shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any street, driveway or parking aisle. 
(2)  Planting/screening in easements. No vegetative screening or fencing required by this section shall be planted inside utility and drainage easements, excluding overhead easements, without the consent of the zoning administrator and the easement holder. If plantings or fences inside utility and drainage easement areas are allowed, these plantings and fences shall be maintained in accordance with the terms of consent and any applicable maintenance provisions. Any tree planted within the right-of-way of overhead utility lines shall be a small-maturing tree. (See section 17-55, Definitions, of the Zoning Ordinance.) 
(3)  Buffer transition yards and required yards (setbacks). Where front, side or rear yards (setbacks) are required by this chapter, buffer transition yards may be established within such setbacks. If the setback requirement is less than the buffer transition yard requirement, the buffer transition yard width requirement shall prevail. 
(c)  Determination of buffer transition yard requirements. To determine whether a buffer transition yard is required between two different land uses, and if so, what the buffer-width and planting-density requirements are, the procedure below should be followed: 
(1)  Identify the proposed new or expanding land use and each existing adjacent land use. Identify the land use impact of each of these identified uses as set forth in the Land Use Impact Table (d) below. A proposed land use is considered existing on an adjacent property when a building permit is issued for the use. If an adjacent property is vacant, and no building permit has been issued for its use, its use shall be determined by assigning it the highest level of use in its zoning classification. 
(2)  Determine the type of buffer transition yard required as set forth in (e) below. 
(3)  Identify the buffer transition yard width and planting requirements for the required yard type as set forth in (f) below. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the required buffer transition yard widths as set forth in this section, any buffer transition yard of less than 15 feet in width shall have a six-foot masonry wall along the length of such buffer yard. 
(5)  This process must be applied to each property line, except when street protective yards (section 17-418) apply. 
(6)  In a development in which there are mixed land uses, internal buffers are not required. On external property lines, however, compliance is required and is determined by the predominant new use. In addition where a land use bordering external property lines is of a higher intensity than that of the adjacent property, buffer requirements must be met for the portion that abuts the lower intensity land use. 
(d)  Land use impact table. See the following table.

(e)  Buffer yard reductions. Notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth in this section, or in any of the provisions set forth in subsection 17-411(b), Applicability, no property on which a buffer transition yard is required shall have such a yard that is less than ten feet in width. Any buffer transition yard that is less than 15 feet in width must contain a six-foot tall masonry wall along the length of such yard. 
The width of a buffer transition yard and the required plantings may be reduced as follows by the addition of a fence or masonry wall, or if there are grade elevation changes as set forth below. 
(1)  Fences. The addition of a closed wooden fence in the required transition yard allows reduction of the required width of the applicable buffer transition yard by 25 percent if said fence meets the following standards: 
a.  Height and arrangement. The fence must be a minimum of eight feet in height, measured on the side facing away from the property to be screened. Such fence must also have its finished side facing away from the property to be screened. 
b.  Materials. Rot-resistant wood is the acceptable material. Chain link does not meet buffer yard requirements. 
c.  Required plantings. The number of required shrubs is reduced by 50 percent in a buffer yard in which a fence is installed. 
(2)  Masonry walls. The addition of a masonry wall along the length of the required buffer yard allows reduction of the required width of the yard by 50 percent and the amount of required planting as follows, if said wall meets the following standards: 
a.  Height. The wall must be a minimum of six feet in height measured on the side of the wall facing away from the property to be screened. 
b.  Materials. Materials shall be brick, stone, or stucco. The wall shall not be of cinder block. 
c.  Required plantings. If a masonry wall that meets the above standards is installed, the planting of shrubs shall be optional and not mandatory, and small-maturing trees may replace one-half of the required shade trees. The requirement that one-half of the buffer yard's trees shall be evergreen still applies. 
(3)  Grade elevation changes. The existence of a natural or man-made grade separation in the required buffer transition yard allows reduction of such yard by 25 percent in width if said elevation change achieves a screening effect similar to a wall or a fence and meets the following standards: 
a.  Elevation. The grade change must be at least six feet in elevation. 
b.  Slope. The side slopes of such grade may not be greater than three to one (3:1). 
c.  Retaining wall. A greater slope is allowable if it is retained by a structurally sound retaining wall that meets engineering standards for such a wall. 
d.  Relationship to properties from which developing property is to be screened. The developing property must be located at an elevation lower than the properties from which it is to be screened. 
e.  Location of required plantings. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the screen, the required plantings shall be located at the top of the slope in the reduced buffer transition yard. 
(4)  Credit for existing vegetation. See section 17-414. 
(f)  Buffer material specifications. See section 17-415 for general specifications for trees, shrubs and other vegetation. 
(1)  Trees. 
a.  Size. Except as provided above under (g) Buffer yard reductions, trees planted in a buffer transition yard shall be shade trees unless within 15 feet of an overhead power line, in which case small maturing trees shall be used. (See section 17-55, Definitions in this chapter for definitions of tree types.) 
b.  Species. One-half of the required trees shall be locally adapted evergreen species. 
c.  Distribution. Trees shall be distributed throughout the yard so as to minimize gaps between them. Trees counted to meet the required number shall be spaced at least ten feet apart. 
d.  Shrubs. All shrubs are to be evergreen and shall be a minimum of three feet in height when planted and shall be expected to reach a height of six feet or greater within five years of planting.

5.  Developments greater than ten acres. For properties greater than ten acres in size, each incremental increase of five acres shall require a corresponding increase in the street protective yard's minimum square footage and minimum width by five feet, but no street protective yard shall be required to measure greater than 50 feet in width. 
b.  Tree quantity and spacing for street protective yards. Each street protective yard shall contain at least one shade tree for every 40 linear feet of street protective yard or fraction thereof, as measured along the property line abutting the right-of-way. No street protective yard shall contain less than one shade tree. (See definition for shade tree in section 17-55 of this chapter) 
c.  Shrubs and other vegetation in street protective yards not adjacent to vehicular surface areas. In street protective yards other than those for vehicular surface areas, shrubs, ground cover, small-maturing trees, or turf shall cover at least 60 percent of the street yard area not used for shade trees or for pedestrian or vehicular access. (See (c), below for vehicular surface area shrubs, etc.) 
(c)  Street protective yards for vehicular surface areas; full compliance requirements. Vehicular surface areas to which this subsection is applicable are required to provide, in addition to the general requirements for location, width and tree plantings as specified in (b), above, a visually modifying screen or barrier to the vehicular surface area, as set forth below. 
(1)  Density. Evergreen shrubs or a masonry wall combined with plantings, as specified below, must form an opaque screen along the length of the street protective yard adjacent to the vehicular surface area. If such screen is comprised of evergreen shrubs, these shall measure at least two feet in height at time of planting and shall reach a mature height of two and one-half to three feet in height within one year of planting. Such evergreen screen shall be maintained at a maximum height of three feet for security reasons. This screen shall be measured exclusive of driveways and sight lines needed for easy and safe automobile access and egress. 
(2)  Reduction of width and shrub requirements for street protective yards with masonry wall. The required width and shrubs plantings for street protective yards adjacent to vehicular surface areas may be reduced by the use of a masonry wall if it meets the requirements set forth below. 
a.  Width. The width of the street protective yard may be reduced by half if a masonry wall meeting the requirements below runs the entire length of the yard, exclusive of driveways and sight lines needed for easy and safe automobile access and egress. 
b.  Masonry wall materials. Materials shall be brick, stone, or stucco, or a combination of one of these materials with decorative metal, such as wrought iron. 
c.  Height and opacity.

(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-420. - Screening for loading areas, trash collection areas, display areas and utility service areas. 
(a)  Purpose and applicability. 
(1)  Purpose. All loading areas, trash collection areas (including dumpsters), display areas (except vehicular display areas, covered in section 17-419, above) and utility service areas visible from a public street or from an adjacent property shall be screened as set forth below unless already screened by an intervening building or buffer yard. These provisions are designed to improve the visual quality of the City of Columbia and to minimize the negative impacts of the areas to be screened on surrounding properties. Such screening shall not interfere with the access and operation of any such area or facility. 
(2)  Applicability. See section 17-411(b). 
(b)  Screening of loading and trash collection areas. Screening of loading and trash collection areas must be accomplished with an opaque wall of masonry, rot-resistant wood, or evergreen shrubs that are one foot taller than the object to be screened. If evergreen shrubs are used, they must achieve the required screening at the time of planting. 
(c)  Screening for display areas. (See section 17-55, Definitions) Screening for display areas (not vehicular display areas, covered in section 17-416, above) may be accomplished by natural plants, closed fences, walls, or any combination thereof as long as the following requirements are met: 
(1)  Screening area. The natural plants, closed fences or walls, or a combination thereof must occupy at least 75 percent of a vertical rectangular plane equal to the peripheral length of the display area, in feet, times three feet in height. Such rectangular plane shall be measured exclusive of driveways and sight lines used for safe automobile access and egress. No additional consideration towards meeting the 75 percent average requirement shall be given for any screening material greater than 60 inches in height. 
(2)  Continuity of screen. No more than six continuous feet of the vertical plane as measured and viewed perpendicular to the street may be void of any natural plants, closed fences or walls, or combinations of these. 
(3)  Spacing of trees. See section 17-415, Plant materials specifications and section 17-414, Credit for existing vegetation. Along street protective yards for display areas, there shall be no less than one shade tree for every 40 linear feet. Trees shall be planted at least ten feet from any tree on the public right-of-way. 
(4)  Shrubs. All shrubs installed to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall be locally adapted species expected to reach a minimum height of 24 inches within three years of planting. All shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches tall when planted. At least 60 percent of all shrubs shall be evergreen. 
(5)  Fences and walls. Screening for display areas may be accomplished with a closed wooden fence, with finished side facing away from the area to be screened, or with a masonry wall. Additional planting materials may be provided along the surface areas of the fence or wall. 
(d)  Screening for utility service areas. 
(1)  Applicability. Utility service areas that are located outside the public right-of-way and exceed 42 inches in height and 42 inches in any other dimension shall be screened from the public right-of-way and from adjacent residentially zoned properties. Foundation pads six inches or less in height, will not be included in the measurement of the dimensions. Screening shall not be required for utility service areas located farther than 50 feet from the public right-of-way or from residentially zoned properties. 
(2)  Screening requirements. Utility service areas that are required to be screened shall be located a sufficient distance from the public right-of-way to allow the required screening to be planted outside the public right-of-way. Screening may be accomplished by locally adapted evergreen plantings that are a minimum of 24 inches tall when planted. Landscaping materials are expected to reach within three years of planting a mature height and width equal to, or greater than, the utility structures that require screening. Screening shall be accomplished in such a manner as to allow safe operation and access to the utility service area. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-421. - Protection of existing trees during development. 
(a)  Purpose and applicability. These regulations are designed to encourage the preservation and planting of significant trees within the City of Columbia, as stated in subsection 17-411(a), above. 
(b)  Applicability. See subsection 17-411(b). 
(c)  Trees to be protected. On sites where compliance with this section is required, the owner/developer shall protect the following trees: 
(1)  Any grand tree. (See section 17-55, Definitions) 
(2)  Any existing city-maintained tree two inches in diameter or larger which is located in the right-of-way. 
(3)  All trees in fair or better condition that are eight inches in diameter or larger that are located in a protected zone. (See "protected zone" in section 17-55, Definitions, of this chapter. See (c) below for criteria to determine if a tree is in "fair or better" condition). 
(4)  Trees identified for use to meet the minimum tree-density requirements set forth in section 17-422. 
(d)  Trees in fair or better condition. A tree is deemed to be in fair or better condition if it meets the following minimum standards: 
(1)  The trunk of the tree is relatively sound and solid with no extensive decay or hollow and less than 20 percent of the cambium is dead. (See "cambium" in section. 17-55, Definitions.) 
(2)  The tree contains no more than one major and several minor dead limbs. 
(3)  The tree has no major insect or pathological problem. 
(e)  Methods of tree protection. All trees to be protected shall be delineated on a detailed, illustrated tree protection plan that shall be submitted as part of the landscape plan for a zoning permit and shall include all information required by the application. Tree protection methods to be utilized shall be clearly indicated on the tree protection plan. Such methods may include the installment of protective barriers and tree fencing and must follow the adopted "City of Columbia Landscape and Tree Ordinance Guidelines" (Administrative Guidelines). 
(1)  Tree protection plan. A tree protection plan and/or permit for tree work is required for the following activities: construction, filling, demolition, grading, paving, trenching, or boring for installation of irrigation or utility lines, removal of protected tree(s) for any reason, or any other land disturbing activity. A grading permit may be issued following review and approval of a tree inventory or survey, site plan and tree protection and landscape plan. The tree protection plan and verification of tree species, size and condition on the tree survey shall be completed by an arborist who has completed the requirements for certification through the International Society of Arboriculture or by any forester registered in the state of South Carolina. 
(2)  Tree protection zone. The tree protection zone extends one foot in radius from the tree for each one inch of tree diameter (measured at four and one-half feet above ground level) or one-half the tree's height, whichever is greater. To protect the roots in this tree protection zone, the following are required: 
a.  Layout of the site utility and grading plans must accommodate the required tree protection zone. Utilities must be placed along corridors between tree protection zones. 
b.  Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, bury pits, concrete washout, burning of debris, shall not be allowed within tree protection zones. 
c.  If there is no alternative location, utility lines may be tunneled or bored under the tree and its roots at a 25-inch minimum depth. Such work must be shown on the approved tree protection plan. 
d.  Protective barriers or tree fencing shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the tree protection zones. Acceptable tree barriers include: four-foot-high wooden post and rail fence with two-inch by four-inch posts and a double one-inch by four-inch rail or four-foot-high orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing mounted on wooden posts, or any fencing method approved by the zoning administrator. All tree protection barriers must be installed prior to, and maintained throughout, the land disturbance and construction process and may not be removed until approved by the zoning administrator. 
e.  Curb stops, concrete curb, or other devices to prevent vehicular damage to required trees must be shown on the landscape plan and installed prior to final inspection. 
(f)  Requesting removal of protected trees. 
(1)  General; procedure. If an owner/developer proposes to remove any protected trees (see (b) above), then he/she must document the request and submit it as part of the landscape plan. The request shall be subject to the approval of the zoning administrator in conjunction with landscape plan/ zoning permit approval. 
(2)  Criteria for removal of grand trees. It shall be unlawful to remove a grand tree without the written permission of the zoning administrator. The location of grand trees requested to be removed shall be indicated on the landscape plan and/or tree protection plan. The following criteria shall be utilized in evaluating requests to remove grand trees or stands of trees: topography of the site; proposed grade changes; location of utilities and driveways; location of the trees; proposed tree planting or transplanting to compensate for tree removal; public safety; tree health, condition and longevity; tree species; and any historic, aesthetic or exceptional quality associated with the tree(s). 
(3)  Requirements for replacement of grand trees. When removal of grand trees is approved, the following replacement requirements shall apply: Grand trees shall be replaced with shade trees wherever possible. An equal number of density factor units of replacement trees shall be planted to replace the density factor units for trees removed. This planting shall be in addition to the required density factor for the site. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-422. - Required density factor for the site (DFS). 
(a)  Purpose, definition and applicability. 
(1)  Purpose and definition. This requirement is designed to encourage the preservation of existing trees and to replenish removed vegetation in the city. The density factor for a site (DFS) is a unit of measure used to determine the tree coverage required on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size. All sites to which this section is applicable are required to meet a DFS of 30 units per acre. 
(2)  Applicability See subsection 17-411(b). 
(b)  Requirements. 
(1)  Requirements, general. All developments to which this section applies, other than single-family residential subdivisions, shall be required to meet the minimum density factor for a site (DFS) of 30 units per acre. Multiplying the number of site acres in a development by 30 gives the required DFS. The minimum tree density of 30 units per acre shall include trees required in the street protective yard, buffer transition yard and vehicular surface areas. (See Division 13, Landscaping) 
(2)  Required DFS for single-family residential subdivisions. The required density factor for the site for single-family residential subdivisions shall be 20 units per acre. See section 17-413, Single-family residential subdivisions. 
(c)  Compliance with required DFS. To determine the number of trees that must be planted to comply with DFS requirements, the landscape plan submitted with the zoning permit application must be evaluated. The following steps must then be taken to determine any additional tree planting requirements: 
(1)  Calculation of existing density factor (EDF). Calculate the existing density factor (EDF) for all trees indicated on the landscape plan as remaining on the site following development. (These trees are required to be protected during construction according to section 17-419). EDF is determined by converting the diameter-at-breast-height (D.B.H.) for each individual existing tree (indicated as remaining) to density factor units using the following table. For softwoods, such as pine or cedar, multiply the units listed below by 0.5. Palmetto trees shall have the value of 1.0 unit each. These units are then totaled to determine the EDF for the site. 
CONVERSION FROM D.B.H. TO DENSITY FACTOR UNITS FOR TREES

(2)  Calculating required replacement density factor (RDF). To calculate the required replacement density factor, subtract the EDF from the required density factor for the site (DFS). 
(3)  Conversion of RDF to caliper. The RDF can be converted back to caliper using the following table. For softwoods, multiply the units in the table by 0.5; any palmetto tree shall have the value of 1.0 unit. Any number or combination of transplantable-size trees can be planted so long as their total density factor will equal or exceed the RDF calculated above and a DFS of 30 per acre or greater is achieved.

(d)  Relocation of trees on development site. Replacement units will be granted for trees relocated on site. Tree relocation is subject to the approval of the zoning administrator. 
(e)  Spatial consideration for replacement trees. The spacing of trees planted to meet the needed replacement density factor must be compatible with spatial limitations and with responsible consideration of potential species size. Where the zoning administrator determines that site spatial constraints prevent meeting the required tree density, as many trees as possible must be planted on the site. The balance of trees must be allocated to the Columbia Landscape and Tree Fund. 
(f)  Allocations to the Columbia Landscape and Tree Fund. If an unmet quota of required trees is to be allocated to the Columbia Landscape and Tree Fund, City Council shall administer the fund, and the Columbia Tree and Appearance Commission shall serve as an advisory board. The Columbia Landscape and Tree Fund shall be used for landscaping and beautification projects upon public property within the city of Columbia and within the planning area from which the fund is obtained. If a balance of required trees is to be allocated to the Landscape and Tree Fund, the following standards apply.

(a)  Certificate of zoning compliance. Landscaping as required by this division must be installed and inspected prior to a development's receiving a certificate of zoning compliance. All plants shall be installed in a manner to ensure their best chance of survival and to reduce the potential expense of replacing damaged plant materials. If the season or weather conditions prohibit planting of trees, the developer may provide a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial surety in an amount equal to 125 percent of the cost of installing the required trees to guarantee the completion of the required planting. Upon approval of the financial surety, the certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued. The financial surety shall be canceled and/or returned upon completion of the required landscaping. 
(b)  Maintenance. 
(1)  General. The owner of the property where landscaping is required shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection of all plants and other screening materials. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition and kept free of debris. Failure to maintain or replace dead, damaged or diseased plants or to repair a broken fence or wall shall constitute a violation of this chapter if not completed within 30 days of notification of such violation. In the event that an unusual weather occurrence or other act of nature destroys landscape plants, the owner shall have two years to replant. Landscaping to be replaced must be replaced with an equal number of density factor units. 
(2)  Protection from vehicular intrusion. Whenever any planting areas required by this division are adjacent to parking or vehicular circulation areas, the planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion or damage from excessive vehicular lubricants or fuels. 
(3)  Soil erosion. All landscape planting areas shall be stabilized from soil erosion immediately upon planting and the stabilization shall be maintained for the duration of the use. 
(4)  Topping prohibited. All required trees shall be allowed to reach their mature size and shall be maintained at their mature size. Except for trimming and pruning done in strict accordance with the utility line clearance policies and standards set forth in this chapter, required plants shall not be cut or severely pruned or otherwise damaged so that their natural form is impaired. Topping of trees that reduces the height to less than the required height shall be considered a violation of this article. The property owner shall be required to replace each unlawfully pruned, damaged or removed tree with a tree at least four inches in caliper. 
(5)  Irrigation. An irrigation system shall be planned, installed, maintained and utilized in such as way as to ensure the required landscape plants receive the optimum moisture needed for healthy survival and growth. 
(6)  Review of landscape plantings. The zoning administrator or his designee shall have the authority to review landscaping and require replanting if necessary to maintain the required landscape plants in good health. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 2, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-424. - Violations; penalties. 
(a)  Notification of violation. If the zoning administrator shall find that any of the provisions of this division are being violated, he/she shall in writing notify the owner of the property of such violation. The notice shall specify what steps are necessary for compliance. No violations may be cited more than five years after damage can be proven to have occurred. 
(b)  Penalties. If the owner of the property subject to the violation notice fails to comply within the time specified on the notice, he/she shall be subject to citation for violation of this division. Each calendar day a violation exists shall be considered a separate offense. Penalties for violation of this division could include:

(3)  Review and approval of the final plat by the planning commission and as-built drawing by the city engineer. 
(b)  Minor subdivisions. Minor subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities, storm drainage systems, or improvements to existing streets may be accepted for review by the planning commission in the form of a final plat. Sketch plans and preliminary plats are not required in such cases. However, the city engineer may require a service connection plan and a grading plan. 
(Code 1979, § 6-4011) 
Sec. 17-492. - Procedures and plan requirements. 
    The following procedures shall be followed in the submission, review and action upon all subdivision plats:

    When, due to the peculiar shape or topography of a tract of land or other unusual condition, it is impractical for a developer to comply with the literal interpretation of the design requirements of this article, the planning commission shall be authorized, after considering recommendations from the city engineer, the fire department, the police department, and the public works department, to vary those requirements, provided the intent and purpose of this article are not violated. 
(Code 1979, § 6-4035; Ord. No. 2005-039, 5-18-05) 
Sec. 17-512. - Streets. 
    All streets which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards and city specifications for roadway design: 
(1)  Extension of existing streets. The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the alignment and continuation or extension of existing streets in adjoining areas in the same or greater width than the minimum required by this article. 
(2)  Culs-de-sac. Culs-de-sac shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way of at least 100 feet in diameter and a paved turnaround with a minimum outside diameter of 80 feet, or other approved type of turnaround, including T's, Y's or landscaped islands. 
(3)  Temporary dead-end streets. Temporary dead-end streets which extend for a greater distance than the depth of one abutting lot shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway surface diameter of 80 feet, or other approved type of turnaround. 
(4)  Half streets. Half streets of less than two lanes are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
(5)  Intersections. The centerline of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as feasible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. The angle of intersection shall be measured at the intersection of street centerlines. Where curved streets intersect, the minor street shall have a minimum tangent of 100 feet at the intersection. 
(6)  Reverse curves. Where practical, a tangent of at least 150 feet on collector streets shall be provided between reverse curves. On major arterials, tangent distances shall be determined by use of standards of the state department of highways and public transportation. 
(7)  Street names. Streets or roads that are extensions of, or obviously in alignment with, existing named streets shall bear that name. The names of new streets and roads shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names, irrespective of the use of the suffix "street," "avenue," "circle," "way," "boulevard," "drive," "place" or "court" or the like, unless, for orientation purposes, suffix streets are connected. 
(8)  Street access to unsubdivided property. Where it is deemed necessary to the development of a logical street pattern and transportation network, streets and rights-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of adjoining property. Incompatible characteristics of adjoining property shall be given due consideration in making a determination of what shall constitute a logical street pattern. Reserve strips adjoining street rights-of-way for the purpose of preventing access to adjacent property shall not be permitted. 
(9)  Intersection spacing. Street intersections shall have a centerline offset of not less than 200 feet, except that for street intersections on minor or local residential streets, the street intersection spacing shall be 125 feet. 
(10)  Additional right-of-way. Subdivisions which include or abut an existing platted street or road that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of this article shall dedicate additional width along one or both sides of that street or road so that the minimum right-of-way required by this article is established. Due consideration for proper street alignment shall be given to location of additional right-of-way required. Subdivisions abutting only one side of such a street or road shall dedicate a minimum of one-half, measured from the centerline of the existing right-of-way, of the right-of-way required by this article. 
(11)  Right-of-way and pavement width. Minimum rights-of-way and pavement widths shall be as follows: 
Street Classification Minimum 
Right-of-Way 
(feet) Minimum

*Pavement width is measured from low point to low point of curb. Minimum pavement widths and right-of-way may be reduced by the planning commission in individual cases upon written approval of the city engineer. 
**Measured from face to face of curb. 
(12)  Street grades, horizontal curves and vertical curves. Street grades, horizontal curves and vertical curves shall be in accordance with the provisions of Part 5, Specifications for Roadway Design, City of Columbia Regulations. 
(13)  Split level streets. Streets which are constructed so as to have two trafficways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall provide a paved traffic surface of at least 20 feet on each level and a slope between the two trafficways of six to one or flatter. 
(14)  Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. Where alleys are permitted, they shall be graded and surfaced to specifications approved by the city engineer and deeded to the city. 
(15)  Access to parks, schools, etc. Streets shall be designed or walkways dedicated to ensure convenient access to adjoining parks, playgrounds, schools and other places of public assembly. Dedicated walkways shall not be less than 15 feet in width. 
(16)  Relation to railroad rights-of-way. When a subdivision adjoins railroad right-of-way, the subdivider may be required to arrange the street pattern to provide for future grade separation of street and railroad crossings. 
(17)  Arterial streets shown on major thoroughfare plan. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided includes any part of a street shown on the major thoroughfare plan approved by the planning commission and adopted by the council, a right-of-way for the arterial street shall be platted in the location and to the width specified in the thoroughfare plan.

    All lots which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
(1)  Authority of health department. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as preventing the health department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of that subdivision shall not be built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in this article are inadequate and must be increased to ensure the protection of the public health. 
(2)  Lot lines and city limit or county lines. Lots should, insofar as practicable, not be divided by city limit or county boundary lines. 
(3)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be of sufficient size so that a structure could be constructed and still maintain minimum yard requirements specified in the city zoning ordinance (article III of this chapter). 
(4)  Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from railroad or major street rights-of-way or from nonresidential uses. 
(5)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
(6)  Minimum lot dimensions and area. Minimum lot dimensions and area are governed by the city zoning ordinance (article III of this chapter) or applicable health regulations.

DIVISION 4. - IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 17-531. - Required; installation. 
    A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements shall have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the improvements required by this article shall be installed prior to the approval of the final plat. 
(1)  Monuments. All lot corners shall be marked with an iron pipe at least 24 inches long and driven to within four inches above the finished grade or flush as conditions may require. 
(2)  Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible the lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
(3)  Water supply. Water mains, valves and fire hydrants shall be installed according to plans and specifications approved by the city engineer. When required, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line or easement line to serve all abutting lots at the time of installation of water mains. All water mains shall be installed in private easements dedicated exclusively to the city; or if water mains are installed in street rights-of-way, easements shall be dedicated prior to filing of the subdivision final plat. 
(4)  Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be installed according to the plans and specifications approved by the city engineer. When required, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line or easement line to serve all abutting lots at the time of installation of sewer mains. All sanitary sewer mains shall be installed in private easements dedicated exclusively to the city; or if sanitary sewer mains are installed in street rights-of-way, easements shall be dedicated prior to filing of the subdivision final plat. The developer shall obtain the appropriate permit to construct from the state department of health and environmental control on the sewer system. 
(5)  Community sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system such as an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by the city engineer. No wastewater treatment facility will be approved unless it is in accordance with the approved sewer plan for the area. All wastewater treatment systems must receive a permit to construct from the state department of health and environmental control. 
(6)  Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city engineer. 
(7)  Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the city engineer. 
(8)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system based on acceptable stormwater management principles, including necessary open swales and waterways, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances, shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans in accordance with the city storm drainage ordinance (Chapter 21, article II) and approved by the city engineer. 
(9)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design of such signs shall be approved by the city engineer. 
(10)  Street trees. The planting of street trees is not required. However, if the subdivider chooses to plant trees along the street to enhance the appearance of a subdivision, the trees shall not be planted on any street right-of-way of less than 60 feet unless it can be conclusively shown that there will be no future conflict with vehicles or with utility lines either above or below the ground surface. 
(Code 1979, § 6-4041) 
Sec. 17-532. - Surety in lieu of completion of improvements. 
    After preliminary plat approval has been given, in lieu of the completion of the physical development and installation of the required improvements prior to the final approval of a plat, the city may accept a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the city the actual construction and installation of those improvements and utilities within a period specified by the city engineer and/or city attorney and expressed in the bond. All easements and rights-of-way shall be shown on final plats and descriptions recorded prior to filing of the final plat of a subdivision under surety bond.

Sec. 17-654. - Designation of historic protection classifications. 
(a)  Description of classifications. It is the general intent of this article to ensure a proper relationship between appropriate urban design and historic preservation considerations on the one hand and flexibility of design creativity on the other hand. To that end, five protection classifications are hereby created, with the intent that each shall impose a different degree of regulation upon activities related to the intent of this article. Protection classifications are as enumerated in this subsection, in descending order of regulatory control. 
(1)  Landmark. This classification shall be applied to buildings, structures, improvements or physical features which have historic, architectural, aesthetic, social or cultural significance to the city, the state, the region, or the nation. This classification shall not be applied unless the feature has been in existence for at least 20 years. This classification should be applied in order to protect such features from demolition, encroachment, removal to inappropriate sites, or other adverse actions which would endanger those qualities of the feature which impart its value as a landmark. It is anticipated that stringent control criteria would be applied for features given this classification. 
(2)  Landmark district. This classification is intended to be applied to either of two types of areas: 
a.  To an area surrounding a landmark in order to protect the landmark; or 
b.  To an area not containing a landmark but which, because of a grouping of structures or other features, may be considered of substantial importance such that the district itself constitutes an outstanding and distinctive area worthy of protection. It is not required that any criteria of age of structures be established. It is anticipated that stringent control criteria would be applied within landmark districts. 
(3)  Architectural conservation district. This classification is intended to be applied to areas which constitute distinctive sections of the city by virtue of groupings of architectural features, distinctive character of the district or distinctive function of the district. This classification should be applied when the regulatory intent is to preserve, conserve or enhance the character, function or environment of the district as contrasted to preservation of specific structures. It is anticipated that less stringent control criteria would be applied than for the landmark district. 
(4)  Historic commercial district. This classification is intended to be applied to areas which constitute distinctive sections of the city by virtue of groupings of buildings and structures which were constructed originally for commercial uses. Typically these buildings originally housed retail, institutional, office or manufacturing uses. This classification should be applied when the regulatory intent is to preserve, conserve or enhance the character, function or environment of the district as contrasted to specific structures. It is anticipated that control criteria equal in magnitude to that of the architectural conservation district would be applied. It is anticipated that less stringent control criteria would be applied than for the landmark district. 
(5)  Protection areas. This classification is intended to be applied to areas which are less distinctively defined geographically, visually or physically than landmark districts, architectural conservation districts or historic commercial districts, but which nevertheless constitute essential portions of areas which should be subject to urban design regulations. This classification should be applied in areas where selective control of specified design characteristics and features is desired as a means of protecting the environs of districts which are distinctive in character or function. It is anticipated that minimal control of selected characteristics would be applied in protection areas. 
(b)  Procedure for designation. Prior to designation of any landmark, landmark district, architectural conservation district, historic commercial district or protection area, the DDRC shall submit a report to the city council recommending the location and boundaries of such designation. The report shall, in addition, recommend general standards for urban design and historic preservation control and other regulatory criteria consistent with the purpose of this article. Such standards and criteria shall take account of the differences in significance and purpose between landmarks, landmark districts, architectural conservation districts, historic commercial districts and protection areas as enumerated in subsection (a) of this section. These standards, or design guidelines, shall be made a material part of the designation and may be amended at the discretion of city council after a duly held public hearing. 
(Code 1979, § 6-8004; Ord. No. 94-16, 5-4-94; Ord. No. 98-079, 11-18-98; Ord. No. 2011-010, 5-24-11)

(Code 1979, § 6-8013; Ord. No. 98-079, 11-18-98) 
Sec. 17-674. - Review process. 
(a)  Notice of public hearing. The DDRC shall cause public notice to be given on all actions listed in section 17-655(a)(2)b. 
(b)  Materials to be submitted for review. Where the DDRC deems it necessary, in order to pass upon a particular proposal in a DP district, it may require submission of any or all of the following, among other necessary items, as part of the application for review: architectural plans, plot plans, landscaping plans, plans for off-street parking, proposed signs, and elevations of proposed structures. Additionally, in any historic commercial districts or for any proposals of multi-family structures, landscaping plans and elevation photographs or drawings showing proposed structures and all such existing structures as are within 500 feet of the proposed structure and are substantially related to it visually or by reason of function, traffic generation or other characteristics, may be required. 
(c)  Matters to be considered by commission. In its review of material submitted with applications for approval, the commission shall examine the architectural design, the exterior surface treatment, the arrangement and location of buildings and structures on the site in question and their relation to other buildings and structures within the district involved, and other pertinent factors affecting the appearance and efficient functioning of the district. In the DP districts, the commission shall not approve any proposed building or structure separately or in relation to its premises as proposed to be arranged, landscaped or constructed which would adversely affect the primary character of the district involved or the setting of public or quasi-public historical buildings or landmarks on which public or private monies have been or are proposed to be spent. The commission shall endeavor to ensure that the exterior appearance and arrangement of buildings, structures and premises in these districts will: 
(1)  Enhance the attractiveness and functioning of each district in keeping with its purpose and intent; 
(2)  Encourage the orderly and harmonious development of each district; and 
(3)  Enhance and protect the public and private investment and general value of lands and improvements within the district. 
(d)  Criteria for review of design of structures and sites. 
(1)  Issuance of a certificate of design approval shall be based upon the requirements set forth in the standards or design guidelines adopted by the city council for each historic district. For individual landmarks, the Governor's Mansion Protection Area, Elmwood Park Architectural Conservation District, and the Landmark District, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as amended and listed below (the "Standards"), shall serve as guidelines until such time as design guidelines may be written and adopted by City Council for each local historic district. The Standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects, taking into account the designation level of each district. 
a.  For landmark districts and individual landmarks, the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
b.  In architectural conservation districts and protection areas, the historic character of a district shall be retained and preserved through the preservation of historic materials and features which characterize the historic district. 
c.  For individual landmarks and the landmark district, each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where severe deterioration or complete loss requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, finish, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence, and character-defining features that have been lost due to intentional damage, removal or neglect shall be rebuilt. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property.

(2)  Criteria for review of new construction. For new construction, the standards shall be used in conjunction with the following review items used for new construction in historic districts without established guidelines: 
a.  Height : Construct new buildings to a height that is compatible with the height of surrounding historic buildings. 
b.  Size and scale : The size and scale of a new building shall be visually compatible with surrounding buildings. 
c.  Massing : Arrange the mass of a new building (the relationship of solid components (ex. walls, columns, etc.) to open spaces (ex. windows, doors arches)) so that it is compatible with existing historic buildings on the block or street. 
d.  Directional expression: Site the entrance of the building so that it is compatible with surrounding buildings. 
e.  Setback: Locate the new building on the site so that the distance of the structure from the right of way is similar to adjacent structures. 
f.  Sense of entry: Place the main entrance and the associated architectural elements (porches, steps, etc.) so that they are compatible to surrounding structures. The main entrance shall be constructed with covered porches, porticos, or other architectural forms that are found on historic structures on the block or street. 
g.  Rhythm of openings: Construct new buildings so that the relationship of width to height of windows and doors, and the rhythm of solids to voids is visually compatible with historic buildings on the block or street. Maintain a similar ratio of height to width in the bays of the façade. 
h.  Roof shape: Use roof shapes, pitches, and materials that are visually compatible with those of surrounding buildings.

(4)  Whether the building, structure or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the city or the region; 
(5)  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
(6)  The existing structural condition, history of maintenance and use of the property, whether it endangers public safety, and whether the city is requiring its demolition 
(7)  Whether the building or structure is able to be relocated, and whether a site for relocation is available; and 
(8)  Whether the building or structure is under orders from the city to be demolished due to severe structural deficiencies, and this criterion shall have added significance in comparison to the criteria mentioned in subsections (1) through (7) of this subsection. 
(f)  Criteria for review of driveways and vehicular parking areas. The DDRC or its staff, in their review of all construction or alteration of driveways or other vehicular parking areas in residentially zoned DP districts located in the front or secondary front yard, shall use criteria which includes, but is not limited to the following: 
(1)  Unless a showing of extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the piece of property can be shown, the amount of allowable area paved for the use of a driveway or a vehicular parking area shall be limited to a width of 12 feet measured with a straight line that runs parallel to the front or secondary front lot line. 
(2)  The designated vehicular parking area or driveway shall be placed so as to minimize its visual impact on the primary structure.

(d)  Group III consists of structures or sites which round out and extend the material-visual history of Columbia when added to Groups I and II; they evidence one or more of the following criteria for selection: 
(1)  The site of events, homes of men, etc., that are interesting locally. 
(2)  Somewhat unusual characteristics in architectural design. 
(3)  Belonging to a family or "genera" of buildings recognized locally.

DIVISION 5. - SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS FOR REHABILITATED HISTORIC PROPERTIES 

Sec. 17-695. - Special tax assessment created. 
    A special tax assessment is created for eligible rehabilitated historic properties for 20 years equal to the appraised value of the property at the time of preliminary certification. 
(Ord. No. 2007-063, § I, 9-5-07) 
Sec. 17-696. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to: 
(1)  Encourage the restoration of historic properties; 
(2)  Promote community development and redevelopment; 
(3)  Encourage sound community planning; and 
(4)  Promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(Ord. No. 2007-063, § II, 9-5-07) 
Sec. 17-697. - Eligible properties. 
(a)  Certification. In order to be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic properties must receive preliminary and final certification. 
(1)  To receive preliminary certification a property must meet the following conditions: 
a.  The property has received historic designation. 
b.  The proposed rehabilitation work receives approval from the design/development review commission (DDRC). 
c.  Be a project that commenced by or after August 17, 2004 to the date of the adoption of this ordinance and work was permitted to have begun prior to receiving preliminary certification; or 
d.  Be a project that commences on or after the date of the adoption of this ordinance. Preliminary certification must be received prior to beginning work. 
(2)  To receive final certification, a property must have met the following conditions: 
a.  The property has received preliminary certification. 
b.  The minimum expenditures for rehabilitation were incurred and paid. 
c.  The completed rehabilitation receives approval from the secretary to the DDRC as being consistent with the plans approved by DDRC as part of preliminary certification. 
(b)  Historic designation. As used in this section, "Historic Designation" means the property maintains one or more of the following: 
(1)  The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as a contributing property in a district. 
(2)  The property is at least 50 years old and is an individual landmark or a contributing property in a local district as designated by city council and listed in sections 17-681 and 17-691 of the City of Columbia Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2007-063, § III, 9-5-07) 
Sec. 17-698. - Eligible rehabilitation. 
(a)  Standards for rehabilitation work. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic rehabilitations must be appropriate for the historic building and the historic district in which it is located. This is achieved through adherence to the following standards: 
(1)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved; the removal of historic materials or alterations of features and spaces that characterize each property shall be avoided. 
(2)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use; changes that create a false sense of historical development shall not be undertaken. 
(3)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(4)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
(5)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced; where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new should match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials; replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(6)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used; the surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(7)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property; the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the historic property and its environment. 
(8)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(b)  Work to be reviewed. The following work will be reviewed according to the standards set forth above: 
(1)  Repairs to the exterior of the designated building. 
(2)  Alterations to the exterior of the designated building. 
(3)  New construction on the property on which the building is located. 
(4)  Alterations to interior primary public spaces. 
(5)  Any remaining work where the expenditures for such work are being used to satisfy the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. 
(c)  Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation means the owner or the owner's estate rehabilitates the building, with expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding 20 percent of the fair market value of the building. Fair market value means the appraised value as certified to the DDRC by a real estate appraiser licensed by the State of South Carolina, the sales price as delineated in a bona fide contract of sale within 12 months of the time it is submitted, or the most recent appraised value published by the Richland County Tax Assessor. 
(d)  Expenditures for rehabilitation means the actual cost of rehabilitation relating to one or more of the following: 
(1)  Improvements located on or within the historic building as designated. 
(2)  Improvements outside of but directly attached to the historic building which are necessary to make the building fully useable (such as vertical circulation) but shall not include rentable/habitable floorspace attributable to new construction. 
(3)  Architectural and engineering services attributable to the design of the improvements. 
(4)  Costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity of the building. 
(e)  Scope. The special tax assessment may apply to the following: 
(1)  Structure(s) rehabilitated. 
(2)  Real property on which the building is located. 
(f)  Time limits. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, rehabilitation must be completed within two years of the preliminary certification date. If the project is not complete after two years, but the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred, the property continues to receive the special assessment until the project is completed or until the end of the special assessment period, whichever shall first occur. 
(Ord. No. 2007-063, § IV, 9-5-07) 
Sec. 17-699. - Process. 
(a)  Fee required. There is a fee of $150.00 required for final certification for each application for review of rehabilitation work of single-family and/or duplex structures and $300.00 for all other structures. Fees are payable to the City of Columbia, and final certification will not be given without payment of this fee. 
(b)  Plan required. Owners of property seeking approval of rehabilitation work must submit a rehabilitation historic property application with supporting documentation and application fee prior to beginning work. 
(c)  Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed application, the proposal shall be placed on the next available agenda of the D/DRC to determine if the project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation in subsection 17-698(a) above. After the D/DRC makes its determination, the owner shall be notified in writing. Upon receipt of this determination the owner may: 
(1)  If the application is approved, begin rehabilitation; 
(2)  If the application is not approved, he may revise such application in accordance with comments provided by the D/DRC; 
(d)  Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted to an application, substantive changes must be approved by the D/DRC. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from eligibility. Additional expenditures will not qualify the project for an extension on the special assessment. 
(e)  Final certification. Upon completion of the project, the project must receive final certification in order to be eligible for the special assessment. The secretary to the D/DRC will inspect completed projects to determine if the work is consistent with the approval granted by the D/DRC pursuant to section 17-698. Final certification will be granted when the completed work meets the Standards and verification is made that expenditures have been made in accordance with subsection 17-698(c) and (d) above. Upon receiving final certification, the property will be assessed for the remainder of the special assessment period on the fair market value of the property at the time the preliminary certification was made or the final certification was made, whichever occurred earlier. 
(f)  Additional work. For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, the property owner shall notify the D/DRC of any additional work, other than ordinary maintenance. The D/DRC will review the work at a regularly scheduled hearing and determine whether the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent the property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work. 
(g)  Decertification. When the property has received final certification and has been assessed as rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and must be granted the special assessment until the property becomes disqualified by any one of the following: 
(1)  Written notice from the owner to the D/DRC and the auditor requesting removal of the preferential assessment; 
(2)  Removal of the historic designation by the Columbia City Council; or 
(3)  Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation by the D/DRC because of alterations or renovation by the owner or the owner's estate which causes the property to no longer possess the qualities and features which made it eligible for final certification. 
Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given immediately to the Richland County Assessor, Auditor, and Treasurer. 
(h)  Notification. The city shall, upon final certification of a property, notify the Richland County Assessor, Auditor and Treasurer that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for the special tax assessment. 
(i)  Date effective. If an application for preliminary or final certification is filed by May 1 or the preliminary or final certification is approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. 
The special assessment only begins in the current or future tax years as provided for in this section. In no instance may the special assessment be applied retroactively. 
(j)  Application. Once the D/DRC has granted the special property tax assessments authorized herein, the owner of the property shall make application to the Richland County Auditor for the special assessment provided for herein.

DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS AND APPLICABILITY 

Sec. 17-791. - Purpose and authority. 
    The intent of this article is to encourage the preservation and protection of trees on private and public property in the City of Columbia consistent with the economic and healthful enjoyment of property. This article is adopted pursuant to authority conferred by the South Carolina Code of Laws. The purpose of the provisions contained herein include: promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare through lessening air pollution; modifying climate; improving surface drainage and minimizing flooding; preventing soil erosion; and beautifying and enhancing the quality of life in the City of Columbia.

Sec. 17-792. - Definitions. 
    See section 17-55, Definitions, of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 3, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-793. - Applicability. 
(a)  General. The regulations contained herein regarding tree preservation and protection on private or public property and the trimming, pruning, planting and removal of trees on public property are applicable to all properties in the City of Columbia unless specifically exempted. The requirements concerning tree protection only apply when there is no application for a zoning permit. See Article III, Division 13, section 17-419 for tree preservation and protection standards where a zoning permit application has been submitted. 
(b)  Exemptions. 
(1)  Single- and two-family residential. Single-family detached or two-family detached dwellings occupying their own lots. The initial development of a subdivision of single-family or two-family homes is subject to these requirements. See section 17-413, Single-family residential subdivisions.

Public and private utilities are exempted from the timber harvesting requirements if an approved policy is in place to evaluate the trees to be removed and provide for tree preservation wherever possible. Such utilities include but are not limited to storm drainage, electric, gas, communications, and similar installation, street construction and water and sewer construction. 
(3)  Bona fide agricultural use other than commercial timber operations. It shall be the burden of the property owner to prove that any timber harvesting or land clearing is conducted for the purpose of a bona fide agricultural use, and said owner must adhere to the voluntary "Best Management Practices" published by the South Carolina Forestry Commission.

It shall be the burden of the property owner to prove that any timber harvesting or land clearing is conducted as a commercial timber operation. A forestry plan shall be submitted that demonstrates that the intended forestry activities will contribute to the long term production of marketable forest products and ensure the continued existence of forests through regeneration. Conducting a timber sale as the sole timber management activity does not constitute a "commercial timber operation." 
(c)  Buffer and best management practices. All timber harvesting shall comply with the buffer requirements and other voluntary protective measures known as "Best Management Practices" and published by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. This shall include an undisturbed buffer along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, except for approved access crossings.

(2)  Required density factor for the site (DFS). Compliance with the minimum tree density of 30 units per acre following the completion of timber harvesting. Trees used to meet the minimum tree density requirements shall be in fair or better condition (See subsection 17-421(d)). 
(3)  Buffer and best management practices. All timber harvesting shall comply with the buffer requirements and other voluntary protective measures known as "Best Management Practices" and published by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. This shall include an undisturbed buffer along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, except for approved access crossings. Such buffer shall be 50 feet wide or equal to the required setback for the zoning district in which the property is located, whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 2002-050, § 3, 6-5-02) 
Sec. 17-796. - Revegetation required. 
    If timber harvesting occurs, and the owner is unable to prove that the work is conducted as a commercial timber operation, or if non-commercial timber harvesting reduces the density factor for the site to less than the required 30 units per acre, the owner shall be responsible for revegetating the site. Revegetation shall provide 40 units per acre and shall be installed within 12 months of the notice of violation.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 21-31. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council of the City of Columbia finds that: 
(1)  Uncontrolled stormwater runoff may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of the City of Columbia and the quality of life of its citizens by transporting pollutants into receiving waters and by causing erosion or contributing to conditions which may increase the incidence and severity of flooding. 
(2)  Proper management of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property, promote a functional drainage system, reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion, attain and maintain water quality standards, enhance the local environment associated with the drainage system, reduce local flooding, reduce pollutant loading to the maximum extent practicable and maintain to the extent practicable the pre-development runoff characteristics of the area, and facilitate economic development while mitigating associated pollutant, flooding and drainage impacts. 
(3)  Non-stormwater discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer system ("MS4") can contribute to the pollution of the waters of the State. 
(4)  The City of Columbia is required by federal and state law [33 U.S.C 1342, 40 C.F.R. 122.26, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 48-1-10 et seq., and S.C. Regulation 61-9.122.26] to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("DHEC") for stormwater discharges to the waters of the State from the City of Columbia Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System ("City of Columbia MS4"). The NPDES MS4 permit requires the city to develop and implement a comprehensive stormwater management program to effectively prohibit the discharge of non-stormwater into the MS4 and to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable. 
(5)  Certain facilities that discharge stormwater associated with an industrial activity, including land disturbing activities, are required to obtain NPDES permits. Also, the South Carolina Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act [S.C. Code Ann. §§ 48-14-10 et seq.] requires a state permit for certain land disturbing activities. 
(b)  It is the purpose of this article to protect, maintain, and enhance the environment of the City of Columbia and the short-term and long-term public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city by establishing requirements and procedures designed to: 
(1)  Control the potential adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with both future development and existing development; 
(2)  Reduce the discharge of pollutants to the City of Columbia MS4 and its receiving waters to the maximum extent practicable using management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods and such other programs and controls as are required by the NPDES MS4 Permit. 
(3)  Control and reduce the contribution of pollutants to the NPDES MS4 Permit and receiving waters of the State by stormwater discharges associated with residential, commercial, industrial and related facilities activity; and 
(4)  Assure compliance with federal and state NPDES regulations and the NPDES MS4 permit. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11)

(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-45. - Ownership and city participation. 
(a)  Unless city ownership is established prior to the amendment of this article, all stormwater management systems and facilities located on any property within the city's jurisdiction shall be privately owned and maintained unless the director accepts the controls or structures for city ownership and maintenance. The City of Columbia owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance, and improvement of those systems and facilities which: 
(1)  Are located within city-maintained public streets, rights-of-way; and easements; 
(2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
(3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
(b)  The city reserves the right to accept or refuse ownership and maintenance of all or part of a stormwater system on any property not owned by the city. 
(c)  Privately-owned stormwater management systems and facilities shall be maintained in accordance with the design and procedures set forth in the approved land disturbance plans. Operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner. 
(d)  A property owner or lessee may hire or contract others to perform necessary maintenance actions, but the city will hold the property owner or lessee as the responsible party should legal actions be necessary. The person(s) performing said work must be able to produce proof of any required trainings meeting NPDES MS4 permit conditions. 
(e)  The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this article. 
(f)  When the stormwater division determines that additional storage capacity or pollution reduction for on-site stormwater management is necessary in order to meet NPDES MS4 permit conditions, to enhance or provide for the public health, safety and general welfare, to correct existing water quantity and quality problems or to provide protection for future development, the city may require additional stormwater controls that may include additional storage or treatment capacity. 
(g)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. 
(h)  To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation, or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees, or agents. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-46. - Watercourse protection. 
(a)  Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee(s), shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation (other than that which is required by water quality buffers), and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner(s) or lessee(s) shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or directly adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(b)  Impaired waters are those waters not meeting state water quality standards as defined by Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. Every two years, states are required to submit a list of impaired waters to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for approval. These waters are then added to the 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. For sites that apply for a Land Disturbance Permit and have stormwater discharges to a receiving water that is listed as impaired on South Carolina's 303(d) List of Impaired Waters, it shall be determined by the stormwater division if the discharge from the site will contain the pollutant(s) of concern and if so, carefully evaluate the selected BMP's and their performance to ensure that stormwater discharges will not contribute to or cause a violation of water quality standards. If the project disturbs 25 acres or more, the SWPPP must have written quantitative and qualitative assessment that the BMP's selected will control the stormwater discharges so that they will not contribute to or cause a violation in water quality standards. 
(c)  To assist in the compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, the stormwater division may develop special protection areas which require additional control of stormwater quality and quantity than provided by minimum design standards. Such areas may consist of watersheds corresponding to adopted TMDLs, known flooding problems and pollution impairments, or other areas necessary to protect, maintain, and enhance water quality and the environment of the city and the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. These areas can be expected to change with time as development continues and federal and state law demands. 
(d)  The city stormwater division shall be responsible for the identification and preparation of stormwater studies. These studies may result in the implementation of additional requirements to meet or exceed the dynamic needs of the area with respect to water quality. The city shall allow individuals and/or groups to submit requests for consideration of stormwater studies. These requests will be weighed against other requests and existing city priorities (watershed requirements, emergency mitigation, priority areas, etc.). To the extent any areas are identified for study, public input will be included in the process. Once the area has been studied, any problems identified, and solutions determined, special provisions may be adopted through the stormwater management design manual and other means. 
(e)  New stormwater systems created as the result of any new and significant re-development project shall be connected to the existing drainage system in a manner so as not degrade the integrity of the existing system, whether natural or manmade, and shall have demonstrated this to the stormwater division prior to issuance of the NOT. Discharge points shall be confined to connections with an existing natural or man-made drainage system. When stormwater discharges are to flow into collection systems not owned and maintained by the city, the owners of all such systems, private or public, shall be notified and provided the opportunity to review such plans. The owners of these systems shall maintain the right to disapprove connections to their system. Private systems shall include all those on private property, including private ponds. Ponds built inline with waters of the state are not included as private systems, but instead protected by this article as any other water of the state. 
(f)  Additionally, water quality buffers are required along all jurisdictional waters and non-jurisdictional wetlands as identified by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Buffers are most effective when stormwater runoff is flowing into and through the buffer zone as shallow sheet flow, rather than concentrated flow such as channels, gullies or wet weather conveyances. Buffers shall be considered a "no disturb zone" along waters and wetlands identified by the USACE. Vegetation cannot be disturbed, removed or replanted unless a buffer restoration plan has been approved by the stormwater division. The function of the buffer is to protect the physical and ecological integrity of the water, to reduce flooding potential and to filter runoff from all development. Variances and appeals may be granted under the provisions set forth in section 21-60 of this article. The BMP manual shall be the reference for all design requirements related to water quality buffers. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-47. - Notification of spills. 
(a)  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a property, facility or its operation and maintenance, or responsible for emergency response for a property, facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of non-stormwater materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. The person shall also take immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the discharge. In the event of such a release of materials containing or comprised of pollutants, including but not limited to oils, greases, engine fluids and fuels, chemicals, herbicides and pesticides, and fertilizers, said person shall immediately notify all necessary agencies. This shall include the Columbia Fire Department and Stormwater Hotline. Notifications shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the stormwater division within five (5) business days of the spill event. In the event of a release of materials regardless of pollutant content, said person shall record an on-site written record of the spill. The owner or operator of such establishment shall retain an onsite written record of any and all spills that will include information on cleanup measures taken and the actions to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five (5) years. Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this article. 
(b)  The owner, operator or other designated responsible party will bear all costs of cleaning up any spills. In the event that the city cleans up a spill, the owner, operator or designated responsible party will be required to reimburse the city for funds used in the clean-up. 
(c)  Notification under this Section is in addition to any notification required under state or federal law, including, but not limited to, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11001 et seq., and Section 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 et seq.

(5)  Other unpolluted water. 
(e)  In the event of an accidental discharge or an unavoidable discharge to the City of Columbia MS4 of any pollutant, the person who caused the unanticipated discharge or the owner of the property on which the discharge originated shall inform the stormwater division as soon as possible, but not to exceed 24 hours, of the nature, quantity and time of occurrence of the discharge. The person who caused the accidental discharge and the owner of the property on which the discharge originated shall take immediate steps to contain the discharge, properly dispose of the contained material, and take such other actions as necessary to minimize the effects of the discharge on the MS4 and receiving waters. The person who caused the accidental discharge and the owner of the property on which the discharge originated shall also take immediate steps to prevent a recurrence of the discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-49. - Detection of illicit connections and improper disposal. 
(a)  The stormwater division shall take appropriate steps to detect and eliminate illicit connections to the City of Columbia MS4, including the adoption of a program to screen illicit discharges and identify their source or sources, perform inspections, and levy fines if not removed. 
(b)  The stormwater division shall take appropriate steps to detect and eliminate illicit discharges and improper disposal into the City of Columbia MS4. These steps may include programs to screen for illicit discharges and programs to provide for public education, public information, and other appropriate activities to facilitate the proper management and disposal of used oil, toxic materials and household hazardous waste. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-50. - Waste disposal prohibitions. 
    Waste collection/disposal shall be performed in accordance with City Code of Ordinances Chapters 8 and 19. No material shall be deposited in or on a storm drainage conveyance structure, including inlets, ditches, and waters of the US or state. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-51. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit or land disturbance permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the stormwater division prior to issuance of a building permit and/or allowing discharges to the City of Columbia MS4. 
(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-52. - Monitoring of discharges and inspections. 
(a)  This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including any construction site subject to an NPDES or land disturbance permit. 
(b)  The stormwater division shall have the right to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the stormwater division. 
(c)  Facility operators shall allow the stormwater division ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit or land disturbance permit, including those for controlling the contributions of pollutants from industrial facilities and for prohibiting illicit discharges and to verify that industries that are discharging stormwater to the City of Columbia MS4 are in compliance with their general or individual NPDES stormwater permit at or above standard design criteria requirements. 
(d)  The stormwater division shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(e)  The stormwater division has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(f)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the stormwater division and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(g)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the stormwater division access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the stormwater division reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(h)  Upon refusal by any property owner to permit an inspector to enter or continue an inspection, the inspector shall terminate the inspection or confine the inspection to areas concerning which no objection is raised. The inspector shall immediately report the refusal and the grounds to the director. 
(i)  If the stormwater division has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the stormwater division may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that the stormwater division reasonably believes that discharges from the premises into the City of Columbia MS4 may cause an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment, the inspection may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of the property or a representative on site. The inspector shall present proper credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or representative. 
(j)  At any time during the conducting of an inspection or at such other times as the stormwater division may request information from an owner or representative, the owner or representative may identify areas of its facility or establishment, material or processes which contains or which might reveal a trade secret. If the stormwater division has no clear and convincing reason to question such identification, all material, processes and all information obtained within such areas shall be conspicuously labeled "CONFIDENTIAL - TRADE SECRET." The trade secret designation shall be freely granted to any material claimed to be such by the owner or representative so long as there is clear and convincing evidence for such a designation. In the event the stormwater division does not agree with the trade secret designation, the material shall be temporarily designated a trade secret and the owner or representative may request an appeal of the stormwater division's decision in the manner in which all such appeals are handled in this article. Designation as trade secret shall not be grounds for denying inspection, but all information gathered during such an inspection will be treated as per subsection 21-52(k). 
(k)  All trade secret material which are prepared or obtained by or for the stormwater division shall be marked as such and filed in a secure place separate from regular files and documents. Reports from samples prepared or obtained by or for the stormwater division or submitted for laboratory analysis shall be marked as such and treated in the same manner as other trade secret material. Trade secret material shall not be divulged by the stormwater division to anyone other than (1) other employees of the city or employees of the state or federal governments engaged in an inspection or enforcement proceeding involving the designated material and (2) to administrative or judicial courts upon order to so divulge the material to the court.

(Ord. No. 2011-095, 12-20-11) 
Sec. 21-60. - Variances and appeals. 
(a)  The stormwater division shall have the authority to grant variances and exceptions to any of the provisions of this division in response to an application showing undue hardship. These variances shall not be contrary to public interest but may be authorized where a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an individual case, result in undue hardship, so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
In granting any variance, the stormwater division may prescribe conditions and safeguards in conformity of this article. A written application for variance shall be submitted demonstrating that: 
(1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the piece of property; 
(2)  These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity; 
(3)  Because of these conditions, the literal application of this article to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property. 
(b)  The fact that property may be utilized more profitably should a variance be granted may not be considered grounds for a variance; 
(c)  The stormwater division shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is a minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(d)  The stormwater division shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; 
(e)  The stormwater division may prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the variance is requested shall be begun or completed, or both. 
(f)  Violations of conditions and safeguards prescribed in conformity with this article, when part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article, punishable under penalties established in this article. Failure to begin or complete, or begin and complete, an action for which a variance is granted, within the time limit specified, when such time limit is made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall void the variance. 
(g)  Any person aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater division under this article may appeal to the city engineer. An appeal under the provision must be filed in writing with the city engineer within 30 days of the decision being mailed or delivered to the person aggrieved and must state the reasons for the appeal. 
(h)  Using information provided by the appellant, the city engineer (or his or her designee) shall conduct a technical review of the decision and respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days.

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[3] 
Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
State Law reference- Floodplains defined, S.C. Code 1976, § 44-96-250. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 21-121. - Statutory authority. 
    The legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does ordain this article. 
(Code 1979, § 6-12001) 
Sec. 21-122. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(Code 1979, § 6-12002) 
Sec. 21-123. - Purpose of article. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water, erosion, or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1979, § 6-12003) 
Sec. 21-124. - Objectives of article. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1979, § 6-12004) 
Sec. 21-125. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means structures that are located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common loadbearing wall other than a firewall. Additions to existing buildings shall comply with the requirements for new construction regardless as to whether the addition is a substantial improvement or not. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter loadbearing walls is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the city engineer's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means that portion of a building having its first floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system. 
    Building means any structure built for support, shelter or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
    Critical development means development that is critical to the community's public health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community, stores or produces highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, or houses occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools, fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane storage facilities. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations, or permanent storage of materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls or breakaway walls.

    Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improve real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood resistant material means any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type floor coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant.

Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of a slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The floor of an attached garage can still be considered the lowest floor if there are no openings. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a dock. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales or service facilities. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of this article. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area. Any unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered the buildings lowest floor, provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For the purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after August 26, 1981. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 26, 1981. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means vertical control, as corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

    Repetitive loss means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Special flood hazard area (see area of special flood hazard) means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructure. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost over the previous five-year period equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The current market value of the structure should be (i) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the repair or improvement for which the current permit is sought, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure required to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

Sec. 21-153. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Inspections. The local floodplain administrator or his designee may make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that any work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of any permit. In exercising this power, the floodplain administrator or his designee has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(b)  Corrective action order. 
(1)  If the local floodplain administrator or his designee finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The floodplain administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that the building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance. He/she shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, but not less than 60 days, as the floodplain administrator may prescribe; provided that where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(2)  Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order as provided for in this Article. 
(c)  Remedies. 
(1)  Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this article, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(2)  The local floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. What constitutes a substantial departure will be determined by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  If a structure is declared in violation of this article and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this ordinance then the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with this article. Once a violation has been remedied the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded. 
a.  The following documents are incorporated by reference and may be used by the local floodplain administrator to provide further guidance and interpretation of this ordinance as found on FEMA's website at www.fema.gov : 
i.  FEMA 55 Coastal Construction Manual 
ii.  All FEMA Technical Bulletins 
iii.  All FEMA Floodplain Management Bulletins 
iv.  FEMA 348 Protecting Building Utilities from Flood Damage

(d)  Functionally dependent uses. Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(e)  Criteria. In passing upon such applications, the building board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(6)  A variance shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provision of this article. 
(7)  The city engineer or the city engineer designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 21-171. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Reasonably safe from flooding. All permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(3)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(4)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(5)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(6)  Critical development shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data, 
(7)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(8)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems. 
(9)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(10)  Site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(11)  Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. 
(12)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this article shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article. 
(13)  Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this article. Provided, however, nothing in this article shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this article. 
(14)  American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in this ordinance, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Code 1979, § 6-12051; Ord. No. 2017-090 , 12-5-17) 
Sec. 21-172. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flooding hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Structures located in all A zones may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. 
(3)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two openings on different walls shall be provided having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening; 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation can be counted towards the required net open area; 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building; and 
6.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than 5 feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
(4)  Enclosures below lowest floor: 
a.  Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
d.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. 
b.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation. 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
3.  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of this section. 
5.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
c.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of this section. 
d.  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures. 
(6)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwater, which carries debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
b.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
c.  If subsection (5)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
d.  The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards and the elevation standards are met. 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
f.  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in this ordinance accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. 
(7)  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
a.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months from the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include; but not limited to: 
1.  Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 
2.  Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
3.  Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
4.  Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with this article. 
b.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with this ordinance, prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant. 
1.  The local floodplain administrator shall require a conditional letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for: 
2.  Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and 
3.  Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway. 
4.  Floodplain development permits issued by the local floodplain administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this article. 
5.  Right to submit new technical data. The floodplain administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time. 
(8)  Accessory structures. A detached accessory structure or garage, the cost of which is greater than $3,000.00, must comply with the requirements as outlined in FEMA's Technical Bulletin 7-93 Wet Floodproofing Requirements or be elevated in accordance with this article or dry floodproofed in accordance with this article.

Should the waste from such person's operations be deemed to be inadmissible into the sanitary sewerage system because of objectionable character as defined by this article, because of concentration of elements or substances in excess of the limits established by the approving authority, or because of flow characteristics incompatible with the best use of the receiving sewer, the approving authority will not approve the discharge of such waste into the sanitary sewerage system until such person has employed, at his own expense, methods and processes of pretreatment as will render the waste admissible to the sanitary sewerage system in accordance with this article. 
(c)  Criteria for approval. The approving authority will not specify, suggest or recommend equipment, structures or arrangements comprising the pretreatment processes. Approval of discharge of industrial waste by any person will be given only on the basis of performance of pretreatment processes (if pretreatment should be required). Approval given to any person for discharge of industrial waste, whether pretreated or not, into the sanitary sewerage system shall in no wise relieve such person of the responsibility of full compliance with this article at all times. 
(d)  Flow equalization. To effectively utilize the capacity of the sanitary sewerage system and to facilitate operation of the waste treatment facilities, it may be desirable that discharge of industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system be done at a uniform rate of flow over a period of 24 hours or by bulk discharge at specific periods of time. In order to accomplish this purpose, any person discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system shall provide, at his own expense, a holding tank from which such waste shall be discharged at a specified rate of flow over a 24-hour period. This requirement may be waived provided that: 
(1)  The total daily waste flow from the establishment of such person does not exceed 50,000 gallons; 
(2)  The maximum rate of discharge from the establishment does not exceed 100 gallons per minute; and 
(3)  In all other respects, the discharge of such waste is in full compliance with this article. 
(e)  Holding tank wastes. Any person proposing to discharge any holding tank industrial wastes into the sewerage system must secure a permit in accordance with this article. A separate permit must be secured for each separate discharge unless it can be demonstrated that the wastewater is routinely produced and is of such quantity and quality as to be in compliance with the permit. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the holding tank or other similar facility to secure the permit from the city. 
(f)  Septic tank trucks. Owners of septic tank trucks or of other methods of transportation utilized in the conveyance of wastes into the sewerage system, or their lessees, shall also secure a permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may include but shall not be limited to the following: 
(1)  Maximum permissible composite concentration of wastewater constituents. 
(2)  Limits on rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow regulation. 
(3)  Requirements for inspection and sampling. 
(4)  Requirements for recording, maintaining and reporting information concerning the origin of each tank truck load, and identification of industrial contributors to the load by permit number. 
(5)  Prohibition of discharge of certain wastewater constituents. 
(6)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the approving authority to ensure compliance with this article. 
(g)  General guidelines. As stated in this section, the discharge of any industrial waste or pollutant by any person shall be considered to be an individual problem, and individual application shall be made by any person discharging or proposing to discharge any industrial waste or pollutant into the sanitary sewerage system. For the general information of those persons discharging or proposing to discharge any industrial waste or pollutant into the sanitary sewerage system, the standards as set forth in this subsection shall apply to such discharge. All requirements as set forth under section 23-102 shall also be applicable, except as extended or amplified in this section. 
(1)  Packinghouse waste. All hair, bristle, hides or parts of hides, bones, animal parts, paunch manure, viscera, grease (in excess of the concentration specified under section 23-102), stock feeds, grit, sand and straw shall be removed prior to discharge. 
(2)  Poultry processing waste. All feathers, parts of birds, bones, grit, sand, poultry feeds, viscera and grease (in excess of the concentration specified under section 23-102) shall be removed prior to discharge. 
(3)  Textile wastes. All lint, thread, pieces of cloth, latex and yarn shall be removed prior to discharge. Kiering and acid boiling wastes shall be cooled, neutralized and stabilized within the limits specified in this article. Bleachery wastes shall be cooled, neutralized and stabilized within the limits specified in this article. Sulfur dyeing wastes shall not be admitted to the sanitary sewerage system. Admission of other dyeing wastes will be considered as specific problems are presented.

(12)  Organotins. Monobutyltin, dibutyltin, tributyltin, tetrabutyltin or any of the octyl tin group shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. 
The omission of any particular waste from the standards outlined in this subsection does not imply that discharge of such waste to the sanitary sewerage system will be permitted. Any liquid waste of peculiar character and volume, or of toxic or unusual nature, shall be subject to review by the approving authority and to standards deemed applicable by the approving authority. 
(h)  Measurement of volume. The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by any person into the sanitary sewerage system shall be measured by one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  If the volume of water used by any person in his industrial or process operations is substantially the same as the volume purchased from the municipal waterworks system, then the volume of water purchased shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged. 
(2)  If, in the establishment of any person discharging industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system, a substantial portion of the water purchased from the municipal waterworks system is used for domestic or commercial purposes (resulting in normal waste), for cooling purposes, or for other purposes that do not require the discharge of such used water to the sanitary sewerage system, such person may, at his own expense, install a meter of a design approved by the approving authority on the waste line from his industrial and/or process operations. The volume of waste flow, as measured through the meter, shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged to the sanitary sewerage system. 
(3)  If any person discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system does not secure his entire water supply requirements from the municipal waterworks system, such person shall, at his own expense, install a meter of a design approved by the approving authority on the waste line from his industrial and/or process operations. The volume of waste flow, as measured through the meter, shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged to the sanitary sewerage system. 
(i)  Construction and maintenance of control manhole. Any person discharging or proposing to discharge any industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system shall construct, at his own expense, a control manhole on the waste line from his industrial and/or process operations for the purpose of facilitating observations, measurements and sampling of the industrial waste discharged from such person's establishment. The control manhole shall be constructed in a suitable and satisfactory location downstream from any pretreatment facilities, holding tanks or other approved works, and ahead of the point of discharge of such waste into the sanitary sewerage system. The design of the control manhole shall be in accordance with the requirements of the approving authority. The control manhole shall be maintained by such person so as to be safe, accessible and in proper operating condition at all times. 
(j)  Exemption from requirement for control manhole. The requirement with respect to construction of a control manhole may be waived provided that: 
(1)  Total daily waste flow from the establishment of such person does not exceed the equivalent of 25,000 gallons of sanitary waste; 
(2)  The maximum rate of discharge from the establishment does not exceed 100 gallons per minute; 
(3)  Access, means and facilities are provided within such person's establishment for the purpose of observing, measuring and sampling the waste flow from such person's establishment; and 
(4)  The discharge of all such waste from the establishment is, in all other respects, in full compliance with this article.

Sec. 23-200. - Findings of fact. 
    The City Council of Columbia, South Carolina makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate enterprise accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in the City of Columbia in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(3)  Stormwater management is needed throughout the City of Columbia. Intense urban development in most portions of the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems, with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. A stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the City of Columbia, and the service charge rate structure should reflect the amount of impervious surfaces that exists on individual properties. 
(4)  The stormwater needs in the City of Columbia include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs, systems, and facilities therefore render and/or result in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city and to properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the unincorporated city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses. 
(5)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems, and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs, systems, and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems, and facilities in direct and precise relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater programs, systems, and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
(6)  The City of Columbia presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed, and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the City of Columbia in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(7)  The city council finds, concludes, and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the City of Columbia, and the most equitable means to fund stormwater services in the city is through stormwater service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city. 
(8)  The city council finds, concludes, and determines that a schedule of stormwater utility service charges based on the impervious area of each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities throughout the city. Such charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including but not limited to allocations of other revenues available to the city, special service fees, special assessments of the city, various taxes as allowed by law, and other revenues as deemed appropriate by the city council. 
(9)  The city council finds that credits against stormwater utility service charges are an appropriate means of adjusting fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines, and penalties in certain cases, and should be granted for properties providing on-site or off-site services, systems, facilities, activities, easements, or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of said property on the city's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, and that such credits should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities, easements, or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer. Credits for on-site stormwater management systems and facilities shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site. Credits should also be granted for activities which reduce the city's cost of public information and education about stormwater management and may include credits against stormwater service charges to public and private school systems. Credits for educational programs and other activities related to stormwater management provided by public and private schools shall be based on the city's avoided costs as determined by the city engineer and not on the cost of the educational programs or other activities. 
(10)  The city council finds that the impervious area on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and that the impervious area of each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge. 
(11)  The city council finds that it is imperative that all revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, inclusive of stormwater quality issues and requirements along with stormwater public education and relations, and stormwater management systems and facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and directs that such revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the stormwater management utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating, and non-operating costs, debt service of bonds for stormwater management purposes, and other appropriate uses as determined by the city council.

    Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of words and terms used in this ordinance shall be as set forth in S.C. Code Section 48-14-20, and 26 S.C. Code Regulation 72-301, mutatis mutandis. 
    Credits. Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge or other fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines, and penalties to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility, or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefitting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the stormwater management programs, systems, and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefitted as a result of the stormwater management program. 
    Detached single-family dwelling unit. Detached single-family dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include single-family houses, single duplex units under common ownership, patio homes, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on individual lots or parcels of land, and single story residential townhouse and condominium units. Developed land may be classified as a detached single-family dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings. Detached single-family dwelling units shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple residential properties. 
    Developed land. Developed land shall mean property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of improvements such as buildings, structures, or other impervious surfaces, or by other alteration of the property that results in a meaningful change in the hydrology of the property during and following rainfall events. 
    Equivalent residential unit. For the purposes of this ordinance, an equivalent residential unit shall mean 2,454 square feet of impervious area. The equivalent residential unit shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to detached single-family dwelling unit properties or classes of detached dwelling unit properties and other properties. 
    Exemption. Exemption shall mean not applying to or removing the application of the stormwater management utility service charge from a property. No permanent exemption shall be granted based on taxable or non-taxable status or economic status of the property owner. An exemption may be granted based on agreements between the city and other persons, governmental and non-governmental entities, and organizations whereby the other persons, governmental and non-governmental entities, and organizations perform on-site and/or off-site stormwater quantity and quality management, including acquiring, designing, building, operating, and maintaining systems and facilities, and performing measures and actions which equal or exceed the stormwater management program performed by the stormwater management utility. Exemptions may be removed or rescinded at any time by the city. 
    Impervious surface area. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. Impervious surfaces may also influence the water quality of stormwater exiting a property and receiving waters to which stormwater is ultimately discharged, affecting its use and value to the community. 
    Multiple-dwelling unit residential properties. Multiple-dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land whereon more than one residential dwelling unit is located, and shall include, but not be limited to triplexes, quadraplexes, apartment houses, multi-story residential townhouse and condominium developments, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one-family group commonly and normally reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater service charges, multiple-dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed lands as defined in this article. 
    Other developed lands. Other developed lands shall mean, but not be limited to, multiple-dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water and wastewater treatment plants, and lands in other uses which alter the hydrology of the property from that which would exist in a natural state. Properties which are used for other than single-family residential use located in detached single-family dwelling units shall be deemed other developed lands for the purpose of calculating stormwater service charges. 
    Stormwater management systems and facilities. Stormwater management systems and facilities are those natural and man-made channels, swales, ditches, swamps, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls, storm sewers, lakes, and other physical works, properties, and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
    Stormwater service charges. Stormwater service charges shall mean the periodic service charge imposed pursuant to this article for the purpose of funding costs related to stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. The use of the impervious area of each property as a stormwater service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics into classes or categories, grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the City of Columbia's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to individual properties or persons for services, systems, or facilities related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater service above and beyond the levels normally provided by the City of Columbia.

Sec. 23-204. - General funding policy. 
(a)  Funding for the stormwater management utility advanced program, systems, and facilities shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater program, systems, and facilities by individual properties or persons and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater programs, systems, and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities throughout the city. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses. Service charge rates shall be structured to be consistent in their application and shall be coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management within the city, including but not limited to allocations from the general fund. Plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, special assessments, general obligation and revenue bonding, and other funding methods and mechanisms available to the city may be used in concert with stormwater service charges and shall be coordinated with such charges in their application to ensure a fair and reasonable service charge rate structure. 
(b)  The cost of stormwater management programs, systems, and facilities subject to stormwater service charges may include operating, capital investment, and non-operating expenses, prudent operational and emergency reserve expenses, and stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management programs, needs, and requirements. 
(c)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater systems or facilities or to private stormwater facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater systems or facilities. 
(d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for activities which reduce the city's cost of public information and education about stormwater management and may include credits against stormwater service charges to public and private school systems. Credits for educational programs and other activities related to stormwater management provided by public and private schools shall be based on the city's avoided costs as determined by the city engineer and not on the cost of the educational programs or other activities.

Sec. 23-205. - Stormwater service charge rates. 
(a)  Stormwater service charge rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the Columbia City Council so that the total revenue generated by said charges and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the city council to the stormwater management utility shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management services, systems, and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, operating expense, capital outlays, non-operating expense, provisions for prudent reserves, and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city council. The following stormwater service charge rates shall apply: 
(1)  Detached single-family dwelling units. Detached single-family dwelling units, as defined by this ordinance, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article. 
(2)  Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as detached single-family dwelling units, as defined by this ordinance, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit for each 2,454 square feet or fraction thereof of impervious area on the subject property. There will be no service charge for developed lands with fewer than 600 square feet of impervious area. 
(b)  The monthly stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit, as defined in this ordinance, shall be: 
$11.80 Beginning July 1, 2017

Sec. 23-206. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exemption, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. A stormwater management utility service charge credit manual shall be prepared by the city engineer specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater services, systems, facilities, and activities that qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(b)  Credits. The following types of credits against stormwater service charges shall be available: 
(1)  On-site detention and retention facilities. Developed land other than detached single-family dwelling units with on-site detention or retention facilities may receive a credit against the stormwater service charge applicable to the property based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Management Utility Service Charge Credit Manual. The stormwater utility service charge credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. The stormwater utility service charge credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities shall be proportional to the reduced costs realized by the stormwater management utility, but shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the person or entity providing same. 
(2)  Public information and education. Developed land other than detached single-family dwelling units that provide activities which reduce the city's cost of public information and education about stormwater management may receive a credit against the stormwater service charge applicable to the property based on attaining and continuing compliance with the requirements and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Management Utility Service Charge Credit Manual. Credits for educational programs and other activities related to stormwater management provided by public and private schools shall be based on the city-avoided costs as determined by the city engineer and not on the cost of the educational programs or other activities. 
(c)  Exemptions. The following exemptions from the stormwater service charges shall be allowed: 
(1)  Improved public road rights-of-way which have been conveyed to and accepted for maintenance by the State of South Carolina and are available for use in common for vehicular transportation by the general public. 
(2)  Improved public road rights-of-way which have been conveyed to and accepted for maintenance by the City of Columbia and are available for use in common for vehicular transportation by the general public. 
(3)  Railroad tracks; however, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(4)  All of that property in the City of Columbia that is a part of the Fort Jackson Army federal military facilities. 
(d)  Timing of applications. The following timelines shall be used in determining the effective date of a credit against stormwater service charges: 
(1)  For new detention/retention facilities as well as educational programs, the credit shall become effective with the first billing period following successful completion of the application process and approval by the city engineer (or his or her designee). 
(2)  For detention/retention facilities as well as educational programs existing on the effective date of this ordinance, the credit shall become effective retroactively to the date of initial billing if an application is received by the city on or before July 1, 2003. The granting of such a credit shall be dependent upon successful completion of the application process and approval by the city engineer (or his or her designee). For existing detention/retention facilities as well as educational programs for which the application is received by the city after July 1, 2003, the credit shall become effective with the first billing period following successful completion of the application process and approval by the city engineer (or his or her designee).

Sec. 23-207. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies and collections. 
(a)  A stormwater service charge bill may be included as a separate line item to the city's water and sewer billing or may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The stormwater service charge bill may be billed and collected along with other charges, including but not limited to the city water and sewer billing, or other means as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. The owner of each parcel of land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such charges and any associated late charges, interest or penalties. 
(b)  Where stormwater service charges appear on the city water and sewer bill and a customer does not pay the service charges for all utilities on the bill in full, the partial payment shall be applied to the respective service charges in a prorated manner. 
(c)  In the event that stormwater service charges that appear on the City of Columbia water and sewer bill including those cases where the only charge on the water and sewer bill is the stormwater service charge are not paid when due, interest and/or late fees shall accrue in the same manner and at the same rate as provided for by section 23-142 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Columbia, until such time as the overdue payment and interest are paid. 
(d)  If a property receives water and/or sewer service and if the stormwater service charges for that property are not paid, the city shall have the authority to terminate water and/or sewer service to that property. Termination will be in accordance with section 23-141 of the City of Columbia Code of Ordinances regarding notice, appeal, and termination of utility services. Alternatively, the city may pursue such remedies as are available and as authorized by state law including the issuance of a civil penalty as provided for by state law. 
(e)  No property for which stormwater service charges are outstanding shall receive water and/or sewer service until the outstanding stormwater service charge on that property is paid in full. No customer with a delinquent stormwater service account shall be permitted to open a water and/or sewer account at the same or different location until the delinquency has been satisfied in full. 
(f)  If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for a particular property, the city may backbill for a period of up to three years, but shall not assess late charges, interest or penalties for that period. 
(g)  Detached single-family dwelling units shall be subject to the imposition of a stormwater service charge upon establishment of a water and/or sewer account for the said property. Other developed lands shall be subject to the imposition of a stormwater service charge upon establishment of a water and/or sewer account for the said property or in those cases where water and/or sewer service is not needed upon the final approval of site development by the city.
