PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Lake City, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Shawn Bell, City Administrator, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts, those of others in the city administration, and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Lake City, South Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows:...."

(c)  In the event a new section not heretofore existing the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, City of Lake City, South Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered _____, which section reads as follows:...." The new section shall then be set out in full as enacted. 
(d)  In lieu of the foregoing paragraph, when the governing authority desires to enact an ordinance of a general and permanent nature embracing a subject not previously existing in the Code, but which the governing authority desires to incorporate into the Code, a provision in substantially the following language may be made a part of the ordinance: "It is the intention of the council, and it is hereby ordained, that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made part of the Code of Ordinance of the City of Lake City, South Carolina, and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish that intention." 
(e)  All sections, divisions, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed must be specifically repealed by section, division, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
Sec. 1-14. - Supplementation of code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city. A supplement to the Code shall include substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement, and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that when they are inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to the Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency, organization or company authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, non-substantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and

Sec. 28-183. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans. 
(a)  Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge/slug load of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this section. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be approved by the superintendent and by DHEC before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. No user who commences contribution to the POTW 90 days following the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the superintendent. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. At least once every two years, the superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals;

    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Other conditions. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

In this schedule, a BOD5 concentration of 0 to 300 ppm and a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration of 0 to 220 ppm, is considered to be a standard sewage waste. The city may calculate surcharges on the basis of COD at its discretion. Any wastewaters having a concentration in excess of the stated limits is subject to a surcharge in accordance with the following schedule: 
(b)  The following monthly surcharge is based on the equitable recovery of wastewater treatment costs as required for those municipalities for both BOD5 and TSS receiving federal assistance for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities and is in compliance with the regulations of 40 CFR 35: 
(c)  $0.50 per pound x (mg/l x mg/month x 8.34). 
(1)  mg/l or ppm: milligrams per liter or parts per million over average strength wastes limits. 
(2)  mg/month: million gallons per month flow. 
(3)  8.34 lbs: equal to one gallon of water. 
(4)  1,000 gallons: 0.001 mgd. 
(d)  This issuance of this surcharge schedule does not in itself permit, nor does it imply, that any such high strength wastewater will be received by the city for treatment. Concentrations in excess of 300 ppm BOD5 and 220 ppm TSS are allowable only in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit. In each instances, the actual acceptance of the waste for treatment is subject to review and evaluation by the city. In some instances pretreatment may be required before acceptance of the wastewater for final treatment by the city.

The records shall be on forms approved or provided by the water purveyor. In the event of accidental pollution or contamination of the public or consumer's potable water system, due to backflow on or from consumer's premises, the owner shall promptly take steps to confine further spread of the pollution or contamination within the consumer's premises, and shall immediately notify the water purveyor of the hazardous condition. 
(Ord. No. 2005.268, 12-13-2005) 
Sec. 28-616. - Policy. 
    The water purveyor will provide a continuing inspection program of all industrial and commercial users of potable water, where it is probable that a pollutional, health, or system hazard may be created; or where materials dangerous to health or toxic substances in concentrations are handled in tanks, piping systems or other vessels on the premises; or where the water system is unstable and cross connections may be installed or reinstalled. The following state regulations to cross connections will apply: 
(1)  Should the connection be between two approved public water supplies, common gate or check valves may be used, provided this has the approval of both water supplies and the state board of health. 
(2)  Should the connection be between an approved public water supply and to a service or other water supply not hazardous to health but not meeting the standards of the approved water supply, and not cross-connected within its system with a potentially dangerous water or liquid, any approved double check valve assembly may be used. 
(3)  Should the connection be between an approved public water supply and to a service or other water supply which have or may have any material in the water, dangerous to health, that is, or may be handled under pressure, or subject to negative pressures, protection shall be by air-gap separation. The air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock or other connection to approved supply. All piping between such connection and air-gap shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met, the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, provided the alternative is acceptable to the water purveyor and the state board of health. 
(Ord. No. 2005.268, 12-13-2005) 
Sec. 28-617. - Frequency of inspections. 
    Due to changes in models or components, methods of manufacturing and additions to the plants, buildings, etc., water use requirements undergo continual change. As a result, new cross-connections may be installed and existing protection may be by-passed, removed or otherwise ineffective; therefore, an annual detailed inspection of all usage is required. 
(Ord. No. 2005.268, 12-13-2005) 
Sec. 28-618. - New construction. 
    All new construction plans and specifications should be made available to the city to determine the degree to possible cross connection hazards. 
(Ord. No. 2005.268, 12-13-2005) 
Sec. 28-619. - Existing systems. 
    In order to determine the degree of hazard to the public potable water system, a survey will be made of the consumer's presently installed water system. This survey need not be a detailed inspection of the location or disposition of the water lines, but can be confined to establishing the water uses on the premises, the existence of cross connections, the availability of auxiliary or used water supplies. 
(Ord. No. 2005.268, 12-13-2005)

Secs. 28-629-28-649. - Reserved 
Article IX. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 28-650. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council, the governing body of the city, makes the following findings: 
(1)  The management of stormwater runoff is necessary to reduce pollutants, siltation, sedimentation, flooding, inflow and infiltration into the city storm drainage system and receiving waters, all of which adversely impact land and water resources and the health, safety, property, and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(2)  The city maintains, or must ensure maintenance of, a system of stormwater management facilities, including but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, swashes, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration facilities, and other components as well as natural waterways. 
(3)  It has been determined through conducting a stormwater system survey and condition assessment that much of the city's storm sewer infrastructure is in need of more regular maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading or expansion in order to prevent flooding and water quality impacts from storm events. 
(4)  There is a lack of resources (equipment, manpower, funds) in the city to adequately address the stormwater system improvements and maintenance necessary to reduce future flooding and water quality impacts. 
(5)  The city needs to enhance the ability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures. 
(6)  Every built upon parcel of real property in the city either uses or benefits from the stormwater management system and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly benefit the owners of all real property. 
(7)  In the city, the extent of use of the stormwater management system by each classification of real property is dependent on a variety of factors that influence runoff, such as land use, topography, intensity of development, amount of impervious surface, and location in a particular watershed or basin. 
(8)  In the city property owners and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system and benefit from the system. Charges therefore should bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the service, and every effort should be made to fairly and reasonably spread the cost of the system to all property owners and users. 
(9)  It is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and, most specifically, the owners of real property, that a stormwater management utility with interim fees and classifications be established by ordinance and implemented as part of the city's utility enterprise system as authorized by S.C. Code, sections 48-14-10 to 48-14-150 (Supp. 1991); section 5-7-30 (Supp. 1991); and other relevant laws and regulations of the state. 
(10)  Creating a permanent stormwater management utility rate structure and schedule of fees is a difficult, time consuming and costly endeavor, and the city is committed to such an undertaking, but finds it is necessary to provide for interim stormwater management utility fees and classifications until the completion of a citywide impervious surface study. Thus, council finds that a stormwater management utility with interim fees and classifications should be established with the intent of establishing permanent stormwater management utility fees and classifications based on the results of further study, to include determination of impervious surface areas throughout the city. The city council further finds that the interim fees and classifications established hereby are reasonable and equitable given the use of and benefits accruing to properties within each of the various classifications. 
(11)  The interim stormwater utility fee will not be imposed on agricultural lands, forestlands, or undeveloped lands pursuant to the amendment of S.C. Code section 6-1-330 (A75, R70, S453).

(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-654. - Boundaries and jurisdiction. 
    The boundaries and jurisdiction of the utility shall encompass all those portions of the incorporated city, as they may exist from time to time and such additional areas lying inside the corporate limits of those jurisdictions within the city as shall be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-655. - Stormwater management utility fees. 
    City council shall establish amounts and classifications for stormwater management utility fees to be implemented to help fund the utility and its' programs and projects. City council shall consider, among other things, the following criteria in establishing fees: 
(1)  The fee system must be reasonable and equitable so that property owners and users pay to the extent they contribute to the needs for and benefit from the utility. City council recognizes that these benefits, while substantial, in many cases cannot be measured directly; 
(2)  Stormwater maintenance costs, construction/infrastructure improvement costs and the overall operational costs of the stormwater system should be borne equally by all classifications of property owners in the city in that all will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits of an improved and well-maintained system; 
(3)  The components of the calculations used to establish fees shall be based on whatever is determined to be reasonable and fair, to be approved by city council and may include, but shall not be limited to, the cost factors of administration, duties and powers found in section 28-653; and 
(4)  The practical difficulties and limitations related to establishing, calculating, and administering such fees. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-656. - Stormwater management utility rates. 
    Creating a permanent utility rate structure and schedule of fees is a difficult, time consuming and costly endeavor, and the city is committed to such an undertaking but finds it is necessary to provide for interim stormwater management utility fees and classifications (collectively, interim fees) until the completion of a citywide impervious surface study. Thus, council finds that the utility with interim fees should be established with the intent of establishing permanent stormwater management utility fees and classifications (collectively, permanent fees, and together with the interim fees, the fees) based on the results of further study, to include determination of impervious surface areas throughout the city. 
    City council shall establish the permanent fees following the completion of the stormwater management utility rate study and shall amend the interim fees through the city's annual budget ordinance or otherwise. Thereafter, the permanent fees will be reviewed and may be amended as necessary, by city council through the annual budget ordinance or otherwise as needed. 
    The interim fees shall be as follows: 
(a)  For all parcels containing a single-family residence a monthly fee of $4.00 per parcel shall be assigned. For parcels containing multiple residences on the parcel, a monthly fee of $4.00 per unit shall be assigned. 
(b)  For all parcels containing multi-family residences (apartments, duplexes, condominiums, etc.), excluding mobile home parks, a monthly fee of $2.00 per unit shall be assigned. 
(c)  For all parcels containing mobile homes, a monthly fee of $2.00 per unit shall be assigned to every mobile home maintained onsite. 
(d)  For all developed parcels containing nonresidential land use (commercial or industrial), a monthly fee of $44.00 per parcel shall be assigned. 
(e)  For all developed tax-exempt and non-profit properties, a monthly fee of $14.00 per parcel shall be assigned. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-657. - Investment and reinvestment of funds and borrowing. 
    Funds generated for the utility from fees, bond issues, other borrowing, and other sources shall be utilized only for those purposes for which the utility has been established, including but not limited to the following purposes: planning; acquisition of interests in land including easements; design and construction of facilities; maintenance of stormwater system; billing and administration; and water quality and water quantity management including surveillance, private maintenance inspection, construction inspection, and other activities which are reasonably required. Such funds shall be invested and reinvested pursuant to the same procedures and practices established by the city for investment and reinvestment of funds. City council may use any form of borrowing authorized by the laws of the state to fund capital acquisitions or expenditures for the utility. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-658. - Stormwater management utility fee billing, delinquencies and collection. 
(a)  The fees will be part of the city's water bill and may be sent through the United States mail, or by alternative means, notifying the property owner of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The fees may be levied, collected and paid in the same manner as user fees applied to water bills. The fees may also be billed and collected along with other charges, including but not limited to other city assessments, fees, or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Nevertheless, if a property owner is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back-bill for a period of up to one year. 
(b)  In addition to any other penalties or remedies provided in this article, the city, upon the recommendation of the city attorney and approval of the city administrator, may institute a civil action in the appropriate court to obtain compliance with the provisions of this chapter or remedy or prevent the violation or threatened violation of any provision of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-659. - City liability. 
    Nothing in this article and no action or failure to act under this article shall or may be construed to: 
(1)  Impose any liability on the city, or its departments, agencies, officers, or employees for the recovery of damages; or 
(2)  Relieve any person engaged in a land disturbing activity of duties, obligations, responsibilities, or liabilities arising from or incident to operations associated with such activity or imposed by the provisions of this article or the laws and regulations pursuant to which it was adopted. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-660. - Requests for reconsideration. 
(a)  A utility customer may request a reconsideration of any determination or interpretation by the city administrator in the operation of the utility. Such request must be in writing specifically explaining the grounds for the request and filed with the city administrator. 
(b)  The city administrator shall review the application and make a decision on the request within 30 working days. 
(c)  The request shall be made upon such forms and be accompanied by such information as the city administrator, by written policy, shall require. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 28-661. - Appeals. 
    Any person aggrieved by the fees charged with respect to property in which he has an interest or against whom a civil penalty is imposed may appeal the fee or penalty by filing a written explanation of the grounds of the appeal with the city administrator within 30 days of the mailing or delivery of the notification of the fee or penalty to the utility customer, real property owner, or person. The city administrator shall render his decision on the appeal in writing within 30 days after receipt of the written appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city administrator may appeal, pursuant to the foregoing procedures, to city council, whose decision is final with respect to fees and civil penalties. At each level of appeal, the reviewing official or body shall conduct a de novo review of the fee or civil penalty, provide the appellant with notice of the review, and allow the appellant an opportunity to be heard orally or in writing upon request. 
(Ord. No. 2017.453 , § 1, 9-12-2017)

PART II - LAND USE CODE 
Chapter 30 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 30-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has, in S.C. Code 1976, titles 5 and 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § A, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § B, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, this chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(b)  The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
(c)  Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § C, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
(a)  This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study, dated December 16, 2014, with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(b)  Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of the county, with accompanying map and other data, are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § D, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-5. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § E, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-6. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § F, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § G, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-8. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § H, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § I, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-10. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more that $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 1, § J, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-11. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory structure and appurtenant structure mean structures that are located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the floor area or height of a building or structure. Additions to existing buildings shall comply with the requirements for new construction regardless as to whether the addition is a substantial improvement or not. Where a firewall or load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition shall be considered a separate building and must comply with the standards for new construction. 
    Agricultural structure means a structure used solely for agricultural purposes in which the use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock. Agricultural structures are not exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the local floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or VO Zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any enclosed area of a building that is below grade on all sides. 
    Building. See Structure. 
    Coastal high hazard area means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of the primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. 
    Critical development means development that is critical to the community's public health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools, fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane storage facilities. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water. 
    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before June 1, 1981. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 17, 1971. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency which contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood-resistant material means any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated August 2008, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term "functionally dependent use" includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places; 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories may not be historic as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the historic structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the state department of archives and history has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 Zone it must meet the requirements of section 30-64(4). 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purpose of this chapter, the Nations Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) are shown. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 means, as corrected in 1929, elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
    New construction means a structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after September 17, 1971. The term "new construction" also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or after September 17, 1971. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means vertical control, as corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps. 
    Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. This act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Stable natural vegetation means the first place on the oceanfront where plants such as sea oats hold sand in place. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to Substantial improvement . 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether substantial improvement will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means, where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

(a)  Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local floodplain administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power, the floodplain administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this article, the floodplain administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(c)  Revocation of permits. The local floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(d)  Periodic inspections. The local floodplain administrator and each member of his inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(e)  Violations to be corrected. When the local floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(f)  Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the floodplain administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that the building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance; a hearing will be held before the local floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and, following the hearing, the local floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)  Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the floodplain administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance, he shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days, the floodplain administrator may prescribe; provided that where the floodplain administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)  Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the floodplain administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the floodplain administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)  Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court. 
(j)  Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP . If a structure is declared in violation of this article and after all other penalties are exhausted to achieve compliance with this article then the local floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation into compliance with this article. Once a violation has been remedied, the local floodplain administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the section 1316 be rescinded.

(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 4, § A, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-65. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 30-4 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local floodplain administrator in section 30-44, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection (4) of this section. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection (4) of this section. No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b.  A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in section 30-43(b)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 30-99. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 30-99 must meet the nonresidential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this article. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local floodplain administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in subsection (1) of this section must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement in accordance with section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs . Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
2.  The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening, 
3.  Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.  Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundation walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.  Enclosures below lowest floor. 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section. 
4.  All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section should be of flood resistant materials. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-4 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
1.  It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator. 
2.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b.  If subsection (5)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
c.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (3) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (5)a of this section are met. 
d.  Permissible uses within floodways may include general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or jacking system attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and has no permanently attached additions. Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of section 30-44, general standards outlined in section 30-64, and manufactured homes standards in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(7)  Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 30-4 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance activities are identified: 
a.  Requirement to submit new technical data. 
b.  For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 
2.  Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
3.  Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
4.  Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with section 30-66(b). 
c.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with subsection (7) of this section, prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant. 
d.  The local floodplain administrator shall require a conditional letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for: 
1.  Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and 
2.  Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway. 
e.  Floodplain development permits issued by the local floodplain administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (7) of this section. 
f.  Right to submit new technical data. The floodplain administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction and may be submitted at any time. 
(8)  Accessory structures. 
a.  A detached accessory structure or garage, the cost of which is greater than $3,000.00, must comply with the requirements as outlined in FEMA's Technical Bulletin 7-93 Wet Floodproofing Requirements or be elevated in accordance with subsections (1) and (4) of this section or dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.

(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)  Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available.

Additionally, comments from the department of natural resources, land, water and conservation division, state coordinator's office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 5, § G, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-102. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100 percent of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. No. 2014.403, art. 5, § H, 11-11-2014) 
Sec. 30-103. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  The local floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article. Violations must be corrected in accordance with section 30-45(e).

(2)  There are no other reasonable means of saving the property from deterioration, or collapse; or 
(3)  The property is owned by a nonprofit organization and it is not feasible financially or physically to achieve the charitable purposes of the organization while maintaining the property appropriately. 
(b)  The owner may be required to submit documents to show that he cannot comply with the design guidelines and earn a reasonable rate of return on his investment in the property. Information required may include: 
(1)  Costs of the proposed development with and without modification needed to comply with the design guidelines as determined by the board; 
(2)  Structural report and/or a feasibility report;

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN GUIDELINES 

Sec. 32-101. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this article to ensure, insofar as possible, that properties designated as historic shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical character of the city. In granting a certificate of appropriateness, the board shall take into account the architectural and historical significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity. 
(Ord. No. 2011.356, § 11.1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 32-102. - Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation. 
(a)  When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness for new construction, alteration, repair, or restoration, the commission shall use the Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation as guidelines in making its decisions. In addition, the board may adopt more specific guidelines for local historic districts and local historic buildings. These guidelines serve as the basis for determining the approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application. 
(b)  The Secretary's standards for rehabilitation are: 
(1)  A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
(3)  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other buildings, will not be undertaken. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
(8)  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale, and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. No. 2011.356, § 11.2, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 32-103. - Appeals.

No paving shall begin until the compacted base has been inspected and approved by the official representative of the city and underground utilities installed and approved. 
(3)  Water mains. Water shall be provided according to the following specifications. Where a public water main is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point, the subdivider shall connect with such water main. In such cases, mains of at least six inches shall be required. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all taps and extensions to existing municipal facilities.

(4)  Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be provided according to the following specifications. Wherever a public sanitary sewer is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point and connection by gravity flow is feasible, the subdivider shall connect with such sanitary sewer and provide a connection for each lot. The size of the mains shall be at least eight inches. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all taps, lift pump stations, manholes, and extensions to existing municipal facilities.

When there is more than one type of unit planned, the height of the planned structure will determine the amount of land which must be set aside for each dwelling unit. Select the correct column in Table C, then multiply the number of each type of unit by the total area required to determine how much land area is needed to comply. Example: A two-story building is planned on a lot 100 feet by 600 feet (or 60,000 square feet). The development is proposed to contain ten efficiencies, five one-bedroom, and five two-bedroom units. To determine if this many units of the type described is allowable, use Column 2 (which is for two-story buildings), then multiply as follows: 
10 efficiencies x 2,000 = 20,000 5 one-bedrooms x 2,250 = 11,250 5 two-bedrooms x 2,700 = 13,500 44,750 Square feet required  
The builder's land acreage is sufficient. 
c.  Minimum yard requirements (see subsection (2) of this section). 
Front yard 35 feet Side yard: 1. Combined width 35 feet 2. Width on one side 15 feet Front yard 25 feet  
Furthermore, no multifamily unit may be erected on a lot which has a width at the building line of less than 100 feet. 
d.  Maximum height permitted. No restriction on height, except that no building shall be erected which cannot be served by existing city firefighting equipment, and every building more than four stories in height must be certified by the fire chief that the structure is capable of being served by existing firefighting equipment. 
e.  Building coverage. No more than 40 percent of the lot may be covered by principal and accessory buildings, except that where parking is located within the structure, the coverage may be increased to 50 percent. 
f.  Accessory buildings . Accessory buildings not over 15 feet high may be located in the rear yard, provided such buildings occupy not more than 25 percent of the rear yard area; and, provided further, that no accessory building shall be closer to the rear or side yard line than three feet, except in the case of a corner lot, no wall of an accessory building shall be closer to a side street line than the side line of the main building; provided, however, that it shall also be as far from the side street line as the required front yard for buildings on the side street or as near thereto as the width of the lot will permit. 
(2)  Additional requirements. 
a.  Additional lot requirements. For each story above the second, all yard requirements shall be increased by two feet. 
b.  Placement of drives and parking areas. No drive or parking area shall be located closer than ten feet from any lot line unless there is adequate buffering as determined by the building official. No off-street parking will be permitted in any front yard. Alleys shall not be permitted as the only means of ingress or egress to parking areas required by this article. 
c.  Spacing of buildings. Detached principal or accessory buildings shall not be placed closer than ten feet from any other building. 
d.  Swimming pools. Swimming pools may be located within the buildable area of any tract or parcel of land used for multifamily dwelling purposes; provided that, when located on property adjacent to single-family or two-family dwelling districts, such pools shall not be located within 100 feet thereof unless there is adequate buffering present to shield the adjacent use from the glare of outdoor lights, noise, and other adverse effects as determined by the code enforcement officer. 
(3)  General information to be submitted for review by the planning commission prior to approval of the project. All applicants for multifamily structures shall submit architectural plans including details such as number, location, and orientation of dwelling units, etc.; plot plans; landscaping plans; plans for off-street parking and service areas and ingress and egress arrangements; plans for proposed signs; plans for lighting premises outside building; elevations of all portions of proposed structures; and perspective drawings showing the relationship between the proposed structure as it is to be located on the premises and the adjacent structures. The multifamily structures will be developed so that they will not be subject to hazards such as objectionable smoke, noxious odors, unusual noise, probability of flood or erosion, and so that the condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, rock formation and topography will not create hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants. Also, plans for water, sewerage, telephone, electricity, gas, and solid waste storage facilities shall be submitted for approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
The appropriate city officials shall review and comment on the plans and report their comments back to the planning and zoning commission. 
(Code 1983, § 22-6.12; Ord. of 3-21-1971, art. VI, § 12) 
Sec. 38-74. - Townhouses. 
    Townhouses shall be constructed according to the design criteria established in this article. Further, it is the intent of this article to provide for several specific types of ownership and development methods. 
(1)  General requirements. 
a.  Townhouse dwelling units shall be separated from each other by a two-hour fire-resistive partition extending from the lowest floor level to the roof, constructed according to the "Southern Standard Building Code" and shall have no openings therein. Where a separation between fire walls is provided, such separation shall be positively sealed in a manner which provides a substantial, approved closure of the space between units which is permanently watertight and verminproof. 
b.  Not more than ten contiguous townhouses nor fewer than three shall be built in a row with approximately the same (but staggered) front line. The staggering of the units may be single or in pairs, but must be at least eight feet. 
c.  No portion of townhouse or accessory structure in or related to one group of contiguous townhouses shall be closer than 20 feet to any portion of a townhouse or accessory structure related to another building outside the townhouse area. 
d.  Yard. No front, side, or rear yard as such is required in connection with any townhouse, except that each end building shall have a side yard of 30 feet from the street line of minor and collector streets, and 50 feet from the street line of major arterial streets. Each townhouse shall have its own yard, private and reasonably secluded from view from streets or from neighboring property. Such yard shall not be used for any accessory building except storage sheds and private garages. 
e.  Townhouse dwelling units shall each have a minimum of two off-street parking spaces. 
f.  Grouped parking facilities. Insofar as practicable, off-street parking facilities shall be grouped in bays, either adjacent to streets or in the interior of blocks. No off-street parking space shall be more than 100 feet by the most direct pedestrian route from the door of the dwelling unit it is intended to serve. Common parking facilities for three or more automobiles shall provide space outside the public right-of-way for maneuvering incidental to parking. 
g.  Visibility at access points for automobiles. In addition to the general provisions concerning visibility across portions of corner lots at street intersections, the following requirements apply to all private drives and entrances to, or exits from, common parking areas. At the intersection of any private drive or entrance, or exit for a common parking area with a public street, no fence, wall, hedge, or other planting or structure forming a material impediment to visibility between the height of two and ten feet shall be erected, planted, placed or maintained. 
h.  Sidewalks four feet wide shall be provided for each townhouse development project to provide safe pedestrian access throughout the entire development. 
i.  Private streets (when permitted by the planning and zoning commission) are interior circulation roads designed and constructed to carry vehicular traffic from public streets within or adjoining the site to terminal parking areas and service areas. The design and arrangement of private streets shall be subject to review and approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
1.  Private streets shall be provided with a minimum width of 36 feet, exclusive of parking bay areas, and a minimum pavement width of 24 feet, measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement. Additional widths shall be required where parallel parking is to be provided or at the discretion of the planning and zoning commission. 
2.  Approved concrete curb shall be required unless the planning and zoning commission shall determine that curbs are not needed when private streets transverse open areas. 
3.  Angled parking areas directly adjoining private streets shall be permitted on one side of the street at a time only. However, such parking areas may be alternated from one side of the street to the other. The combined length of such parking areas shall not exceed 50 percent of the length of the adjoining roadway. All other angled parking areas must be clearly separated from the private street by at least a barrier island. 
4.  In no case shall a street name be used which will duplicate or be confused with existing streets in the area of jurisdiction of the planning and zoning commission. All street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission. 
j.  Density. Not more than ten townhouse units per gross residential acre shall be permitted. 
k.  Floor area regulations. 
1.  No townhouse unit shall be smaller than 800 square feet, and the average size of the townhouse in any group shall be a minimum of 1,000 square feet. 
2.  Private usable open space, such as balconies, sun decks, patios, etc., shall be provided contiguous to each dwelling unit. The area of such open space shall not be less than ten percent of the floor area of the unit served; such square footage may consist of one or more patio areas. Open roof areas and balconies designed and planned for patio purposes may be credited for no more than 50 percent of the required patio area. All patio outdoor living areas for each townhouse unit shall be enclosed by a wall affording adequate screening except where a natural feature or common open area would suggest an exception after review of the site plan. Such wall shall be of masonry or other material having a life expectancy of not less than ten years and a minimum height of six feet. Such patio areas shall be made of a part of the townhouse unit and so stated in the declaration, as defined elsewhere in this article. 
l.  Utilities and services. Each townhouse shall be independently served by separate heating, air conditioning, sewer, water, electric power, gas and other facility and utility services, wherever such utilities and services are provided, and no townhouse shall be in any way dependent upon such services, or utility lines located within another unit or on, or in another townhouse or townhouse site, except as may be installed in public easements. All townhouses must be connected to public water and sewer lines and all electrical and telephone lines in a townhouse development site shall be placed underground. Proper and adequate access shall be provided for firefighting purposes, and to service areas for garbage and waste collection, and for other necessary services. 
m.  Screening of garbage and storage areas. All exterior garbage containers, incinerators, or other outside storage areas shall be screened by an opaque enclosure of not less than five feet in height. 
n.  Open space. In group development projects involving townhouses, and in all townhouse projects where more than 20 units are to be constructed, a common area amounting to at least ten percent of the gross townhouse project area shall be provided on the same or adjacent block. No buildings, parking, storage, or other use shall be made in this open space. 
o.  Maintenance of common space areas, parking, drives and other areas and facilities. Prior to approval of any townhouse development project, provisions satisfactory to the city shall be made to assure that non-publicly-owned areas (common areas) and facilities for the common use of the occupants and/or owners of the townhouses shall be maintained in a satisfactory manner. The instrument incorporating such provision (declaration) shall be approved by the city attorney as to form and legal sufficiency as provided in the provisions of the South Carolina Horizontal Property Act and/or the provisions of this article through deed restrictions or other legal agreements. All townhouse declarations shall require the Association, as defined elsewhere in this article, to provide exterior building maintenance services and architectural control. 
p.  General information to be submitted for review by the planning commission prior to approval of the project. All applicants for townhouses shall submit architectural plans including details such as number, location and orientation of dwelling units, etc.; plot plans; landscaping plans; plans for off-street parking, service areas, and ingress and egress arrangements; plans for proposed signs; plans for lighting premises outside building; elevations of all portions of proposed structures; and perspective drawings showing the relationship between the proposed structure as it is to be located on the premises and the adjacent structures. The townhouses will be developed so that they will not be subject to hazards such as objectionable smoke, noxious odors, unusual noise, probability of flood or erosion, and so that the condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, rock formation and topography will not create hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants. Also, plans for water, sewerage, telephone, electricity, gas, solid waste storage and collection, and any and all other utilities and facilities shall be submitted for approval by the planning commission. The appropriate city officials shall review and comment on the plans and report their comments back to the planning commission. 
(2)  Special requirements by ownership and development type. 
a.  Small-scale townhouse projects consisting of an overall size of five acres or less shall be developed using either the condominium or resubdivision into individual lots of record methods without following the platting procedures prescribed under the PUD section of this chapter. The resubdivision of land shall be approved by the planning commission using the standard subdivision procedures only after 100 percent of the units have been constructed. 
1.  Private streets are prohibited. 
2.  Minimum lot size is 12,500 square feet prior to resubdivision into individual lots of record. After resubdivision, the minimum lot size shall be 2,500 square feet and the minimum width shall be 25 feet at the point abutting the public right-of-way. 
b.  Large-scale township projects consisting of more than five acres shall be developed using either the condominium or resubdivision into individual lots of record method and shall be developed under the platting procedures prescribed under the PUD section of this chapter. In those cases where the townhouse units are a part of a larger PUD project, the PUD zoning district shall apply. In those cases where the townhouse project is not a part of a larger PUD project, the townhouse project shall be located in an R-2 District only. 
1.  Private streets may be permitted by the planning commission as provided in subsection (1)i of this section. 
2.  Minimum lot size prior to resubdivision of the project into lots of record shall be two acres. After resubdivision, the minimum lot size shall be 1,800 square feet and the minimum width shall be 20 feet at any given point. 
3.  The resubdivision of land shall be approved by the planning commission using the procedures established in the PUD section of this chapter only after 100 percent of the units have been constructed. A project may be broken into several sections for purposes of resubdivision and platting; however, according to South Carolina Act 487 of 1967, the clerk of the county court shall not record a final plat for the resubdivision of the land unless the chairperson and/or secretary of the planning commission has signed the final plat. 100 percent of the units within the area to be platted must be constructed and all requirements of the planning commission and this article must be met for the planning commission to approve the final plat. 
4.  An ownership association shall provide a means for maintenance and upkeep of common areas by assessment of lot owners or some other method to ensure that individual lot owners will be legally obligated to contribute a proportionate cost of the maintenance of the common areas of the project.

(4)  Accessory structures. An accessory structure, the cost of which is greater than $3,000.00, must comply with the elevated structure requirements of this article. When accessory structures of $3,000.00 or less are to be placed in the floodplain, such structure shall: 
a.  Not be used for human habitation, including work, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas; and 
b.  Be designed to have low flood damage potential, be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to floodwaters, and be firmly anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral movement. 
(5)  Floodways. The following provisions shall apply within floodways: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, or other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of a base flood. 
b.  Where no such increase is certified, new construction and substantial improvements may be permitted in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
c.  Permissible uses exempt from such certification include general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, hiking and horseback riding trails, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. 
(6)  Standards for streams and/or floodways without established base flood elevations. Development contiguous to small streams where no base flood data have been provided or where no floodways have been identified shall adhere to the following: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development, shall be permitted within 100 feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered, professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of base flood discharge. 
b.  Where no such increase is certified, new construction and substantial improvements may be allowed within such areas, provided all applicable provisions of this article are satisfied. 
(7)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. An access road at or above the base flood elevation shall be provided to allow emergency access during flood conditions; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage, provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
c.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments greater than the lesser of five lots or five acres.

Sec. 38-164. - Filing of a request for approval of a planned unit development district. 
    The filing of a plan for a planned unit development district shall constitute a request for an amendment to this chapter and shall meet the requirements specified in this article. It is highly recommended, although not required, that potential applicants submit a sketch plan of the proposed development to appropriate city staff prior to filing a preliminary site plan, as a basis for specific agreements concerning plans, programs and instruments, or specific modification of details of applicable regulations where it is alleged by the applicant that such modification serves public purposes to an equivalent or higher degree. In addition, it is the intent of this chapter that, to the extent possible, all negotiations between applicants and the city concerning an application be reduced to a written record, including city requests for changes in interpretation or application of regulations, and reasons for granting or denying each such request. The written record should cover all stages of the project review process from informal discussion of a sketch plan to final review and approval or denial by city council. In addition, the following regulations shall apply: 
(1)  Seven copies of a preliminary site plan shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission shall review the proposals and hold a public hearing prior to submitting a recommendation to the city council, The commission may make reasonable, additional requirements, including, but not limited to, utilities, drainage, landscaping and maintenance thereof, lighting, signs and advertising devices, screening, access-ways, curb cuts, traffic control, height of buildings and setback of buildings, to protect adjoining residential lots or uses, or to protect the PUD from adjacent uses. 
(3)  Approval by city council constitutes creation of the planned unit development district. 
(4)  Following approval by city council, a final development plan shall be recorded in accordance with the provisions of this article prior to issuance of a building permit for construction of any improvements within the planned unit development district. 
(5)  Following the recording of the final development plan of the entire PUD project with the county clerk of courts, building permits may be issued and construction begun. The planning and zoning commission shall forward three copies of the approved final development plan to the code enforcement officer. 
(6)  It shall be the responsibility of the code enforcement officer to inspect the construction and development of the PUD project to ensure that the project is developed according to the approved final development plan. In the event that the developer fails to develop his project according to the plans and if, in the code enforcement officer's professional judgment, the changes are more than minor changes as specified in section 38-170, the code enforcement officer shall revoke the building permit and comply with section 38-172. The developer shall petition the planning and zoning commission for an official amendment to the approved final development plan. 
(7)  Upon completion of the development, the PUD project may, at the election of the developer, be resubdivided into smaller lots of record. The resubdivision of the PUD project shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission after 100 percent of the structures have been constructed and completed to the standards of the building codes. A project may be broken into several sections for purposes of resubdivision and platting; however, the county clerk of courts shall not record a final plat for the resubdivision of the land unless the chairperson and/or secretary of the planning and zoning commission has signed the final plat. 100 percent of the structures and major improvements within the area to be platted must be constructed and all requirements of the planning and zoning commission and this chapter must be met for the planning and zoning commission to approve the final plat.

Such zones are show on the Lake City Municipal Airport zoning maps consisting of two sheets, prepared by Eastern Engineering, Inc., which is attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived and made a part thereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Utility runway approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the end of the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.

Sec. 38-291. - Permits. 
(a)  Future users. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 125 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. Any planned tree or structure of more than 125 feet in height above the ground shall require permit approval. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, permits shall be required for any planned tree or structure. 
(3)  In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones within the perimeter of the horizontal zone, permits shall be required for any planned tree or structure. 
Nothing contained in any of the forgoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 38-290. 
(b)  Existing users. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment for creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the applications for such a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the airport manager determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or destroyed, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the application height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the city planning commission for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the city planning commission unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the city planning commission may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the city planning commission this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
