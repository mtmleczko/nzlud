PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Greer, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through September 24, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    It is hoped that this Code will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-12. - Supplementation of Code.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)	In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)	When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into the unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)	Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)	Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)	Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
(Code 1982, § 1-12) 
Sec. 1-13. - Liability for violations by corporations, etc.

(Code 1982, § 1-13) 
Sec. 1-14. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
    Wherever in this Code or in any ordinance or resolution of the city, or rule or regulation or order promulgated by any officer or agency of the city under authority duly vested in him, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or wherever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment not exceeding 30 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Such sentence of imprisonment may be to the county prison camp. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Code 1982, § 1-14) 
State Law reference- General limit on penalty, S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-30. 
Sec. 1-15. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the council without the incorporation in this Code of any such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
(Code 1982, § 1-15) 
Sec. 1-16. - Provisions considered as continuations of existing ordinances. 
    The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as those of the 1982 Code and all ordinances adopted subsequent to the 1982 Code and included herein, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
(Code 1982, § 1-16) 
Sec. 1-17. - Ordinances not affected by adoption of Code.

ARTICLE IX. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 18-431. - Legislative studies and findings. 
(a)	From the Spartanburg County Ordinance, the following is quoted with approval and incorporated by reference into this article: 
(1)	"The county acknowledges the decisions of the South Carolina Supreme Court in Connor v. Town of Hilton Head, 314 S.C. 251, 442 S.E. 2d 608 (1994), and Diamonds v. Greenville County, 325 S.C. 154, 480 S.E.2d 718, (1997) striking down those ordinances because municipalities and counties in South Carolina have no power to enact local ordinances prohibiting public nudity nor ordinances inconsistent with the Constitution or general laws of the state. Nothing in this article is intended to depart from those decisions and shall not be so construed. It has also considered the decision in State v. Bouye, 325 S.C. 260, 490 S.E.2d 16(1997) sustaining the verdict of a Spartanburg County General Sessions jury that beyond a reasonable doubt a topless dancing establishment in Spartanburg County violated state statute by multiple acts of lewd and lascivious behavior over a period of more than half a year. The sheriff's files show many secondary criminal effects having no free speech implications of that and the other sexually oriented businesses regulated by this ordinance. The county has conducted an extensive review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities including, but not limited to, Islip, New York (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); City of Los Angeles, California (1977); Austin, Texas (1986); Whittier, California (1978); New Hanover County, North Carolina (1989); and Manatee County, Florida (1987); has conducted its own studies of real estate appraisers, commercial businesses, residential owners, and parents in Spartanburg County; 
(2)	From review of information from our sheriff's office, and our citizens, other cities' studies and their own surveys and testimony from its citizens there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing among other adverse secondary effects, increased crime and downgrading of property values; 
(3)	Sexually oriented businesses in the County of Spartanburg require special supervision from public safety and health agencies of the county in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as citizens of the county; 
(4)	It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are operating in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to crime, lower property values, urban blight and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area, produce very loud music; 
(5)	The county council finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution, sexual liaison of a casual nature; 
(6)	Increased crime and unhealthful conduct tend to accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented business including but not limited to prostitution, pandering, exposing minors to materials, possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography, possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property; 
(7)	Concern over sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, is a legitimate health concern of the county which demands reasonable regulations of sexually oriented business in order to protect the health and well being of the citizens; 
(8)	The county council has considered in part, each of the following matters: (a) areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of sexually oriented business uses: (b) areas where children could be expected to walk, patronize, or frequent to be free of sexually oriented business uses; (c) sexually oriented business uses should be located in areas of the county which are not in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks, or other public facilities and schools; (d) the image of the County of Spartanburg as a pleasant attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented business uses in close proximity to residential land uses, churches, parks and other public facilities, and schools; (e) sexually oriented business land use should be regulated by land use provisions to separate it from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself; (f) residents of the County of Spartanburg and persons who are nonresidents, but use the county for shopping and other commercial needs will move from the community or shop elsewhere if sexually oriented businesses' land uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks, and other public facilities, and schools; (g) merchants in the commercial area of the county are concerned about the adverse impact and the character and quality of the county in the event that sexually oriented business land uses are located within close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks, and other public facilities, and schools, and that such locations will reduce retail trade to commercial uses in the vicinity, thus reducing property values and tax revenues to the county; and that such adverse effect on property values and businesses would cause the loss to some commercial districts within the county leading to further deterioration of the commercial quality of the county; and (h) no evidence has been presented to show that location of sexually oriented businesses within the county will improve the commercial viability or quality of life of the community; 
(9)	Controlling the location of certain businesses, permitting and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to insure the operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places which minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation; 
(10)	The county recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values; 
(11)	The county council finds that there would be a deterioration in the quality of businesses which choose to operate in and around such sexually oriented businesses; 
(12)	The county council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, protect and citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses, deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and social diseases; 
(13)	The county council has considered the decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding local regulation of sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976) reh. denied 429 U.S. 873; Renton v. Playtime Theatres, 475 U.S.41 (1986) reh. denied 475 U.S. 1132; FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and City of National City v. Wiener, et al, 3 Cal. 4th 832 (1993). Topanga Press, Inc., et al v. City of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524 (1993); 
(14)	The county council has determined that location criteria alone does not adequately protect health, safety and general welfare of the people of Spartanburg County and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented businesses is in the public interest; 
(15)	The county council, consistent with sale and consumption of alcohol and outside advertising limitations, further finds that restricted hours of operation will further prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented business; 
(16)	It is not the intent of this ordinance to suppress any speech activities protected by South Carolina and United States Constitution, but to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; 
(17)	It is not the intent of the county council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in Spartanburg County; 
(18)	The county council and staff find that the live entertainment presented by some sexually oriented business establishments involves a considerable amount of bodily contact between patrons and performers, including physical contact while giving and receiving gratuities, including hugging, kissing, and sexual fondling of performers and patrons. Many sexually oriented businesses offer "sofa/couch" or "lap" dancing. In these "dances," the performers sometimes do such things as sit in the patron's lap, place their breasts against the patron's face; while physical contact is maintained, gyrate in such a manner as to simulate sexual intercourse. Some of this conduct would violate state laws which prohibit, among other things, the public fondling of genitals; 
(19)	The county council and staff find that a number of courts have upheld distance limitations between performers and patrons, prohibitions against physical contact between performers and patrons, and direct payment and receipt of gratuities between performers and patrons at sexually oriented business establishments that provide live entertainment: BSA, Inc. v. King Count, 804 F.2d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 1986) (six feet); Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d. 1053 (9th Cir. 1986) (ten feet); Zanganeh v. Hymes, 844 F. Supp. 1087, 1091 (D.Md. 1994) (six feet); T-Marc, Inc. v. Pinellas County, 804 F. Supp. 1500, 1506 (M.D. Fla. 1992) (three feet), DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 894 F. Supp. 1140 (E.D. Tenn. 1995) (six feet and prohibiting direct payment and receipt of gratuities); Parker v. Whitfield County, 463 S. E. 2d 116, (Ga. 1995) (prohibiting tipping and contact between dancers and patrons) and Hang on, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995) (aff'd prohibition on touching or any contact between dancers and patrons). The county council and staff have also reviewed a Letter by the city of Newport Beach, California regarding "The Mermaid Application." dated April 12, 1996, containing a notice of revocation and refusal to renew a sexually oriented business permit based on repeated violations of the Newport Beach Municipal Code. The violations include distance limitations and direct payment and receipt of gratuities between performers and patrons during physical contact, including sexual contact; 
(20)	The county council and staff recognize that preventing prostitution and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases are clearly within its police powers, southeastern Promotions, Inc. v. Conrad, 341 F. Supp. 465, 477 (E.D. Tenn. 1972), rev'd on other grounds, 420 U.S. 546 (1975). The county council and staff believe that prohibiting physical contact between performers and patrons at a sexually oriented business establishment, prohibiting performers from soliciting payment of gratuities from patrons, and the direct payment of gratuities to performers by patrons are a reasonable and effective means of addressing these legitimate governmental interests. It is not the intent of the county to place any impermissible burden on any constitutionally protected expression or expressive conduct by the enactment or enforcement of such regulations; and 
(21)	All of the above are the basis for the requirements, procedures, and governing provisions of this article and shall be used and referred to in its construction and interpretations." 
(b)	The city council finds that the reasoning of the Spartanburg County Council applies equally to the city, and hereby adopts the reasoning and the comments quoted in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Code 1982, § 16-200) 
Sec. 18-432. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent any deleterious effects as a result of the location or concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses, to the fullest extent of its authority pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, §§ 4-9-25 and 4-9-30(9). The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.

Chapter 35 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION [1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 18-2014, adopted July 22, 2014, repealed Ch. 35 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 35, §§ 35-1-35-10, 35-31-35-34, 35-51-35-55, 35-71-35-77, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 34-2007, § 2(5:12), adopted Sept. 11, 2007. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 35-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code 1976, Title 5, Chapters 7, 23, and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Chapter 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Greer City Council, of Greer, South Carolina does ordain [this chapter] as follows: 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-2. - Findings of fact. 
    The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-4. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Greenville County Flood Insurance Study, dated August 18, 2014 and Spartanburg County January 6, 2011 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study for the unincorporated areas of Greenville and Spartanburg County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-5. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-6. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-8. - Partial invalidity and severability. 
    If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-10. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-11. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter it's most reasonable application. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means structures that are located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Garages, carports and storage sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the floor area or height of a building or structure. Additions to existing buildings shall comply with the requirements for new construction regardless as to whether the addition is a substantial improvement or not. Where a firewall or load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and must comply with the standards for new construction. 
    Agricultural structure means a structure used solely for agricultural purposes in which the use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock. Agricultural structures are not exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the local floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any enclosed area of a building that is below grade on all sides. 
    Critical development means development that is critical to the community's public health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools, fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane storage facilities. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water. 
    Executive Order 11988 (floodplain management) means issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM, or before September 28, 1979, for FIRMs effective before that date. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 28, 1979. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs). 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood-resistant material means any building material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water, including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant. Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2 Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08 and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; (b) certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; (c) individually listed on a State inventory of historic places; (d) individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified (1) by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, or (2) directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories may not be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means applies to all new and renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a BUILDING has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A, AE and A1-A30 zone it must meet the requirements of section 35-51(4) of this chapter. 
    Lowest adjacent grade (LAG) means is an elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building or proposed building walls. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area. Any unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purpose of this chapter, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) are shown. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means as corrected in 1929, elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea level. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means vertical control, as corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on flood insurance rate maps. 
    New construction means structure for which the start of construction commenced after September 28, 1979. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or before September 28, 1979. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)	Built on a single chassis; 
(2)	Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and, 
(4)	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss means a building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 means the act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of "substantial improvement." 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)	Project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); 
(2)	Alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; or 
Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether substantial improvement will occur. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means is a grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter.

The stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor. 
(c)	Revocation of permits. The local floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
(d)	Periodic inspections. The local floodplain administrator and each member of his inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
(e)	Violations to be corrected. When the local floodplain administrator finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns. 
(f)	Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, that. 
(1)	The building or property is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance; 
(2)	A hearing will be held before the local floodplain administrator at a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and 
(3)	Following the hearing, the local floodplain administrator may issue such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears appropriate. 
(g)	Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the building or development is in violation of the flood damage prevention ordinance, he shall make an order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such period, not less than 60 days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible. 
(h)	Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the administrator and the clerk within ten days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke the order. 
(i)	Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the court.

ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 35-51. - General standards. 
    Development may not occur in the floodplain where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)	Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)	Flood-resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage, in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
(3)	Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; 
(4)	Critical development. Shall be elevated to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data; 
(5)	Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus three feet. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building; 
(6)	Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(7)	Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; 
(8)	Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; 
(9)	Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development and structures; 
(10)	Nonconforming buildings or uses. Nonconforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this chapter; 
(11)	American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 35-52., as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard (zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 35-3, or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local floodplain administrator section 35-34, the following provisions are required: 
(1)	Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection (2). 
(2)	Non-residential construction. 
a.	New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than three feet, above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in subsection (4) No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be flood proofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
b.	A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification requirements in section 35-33(b)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 35-74 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 35-74 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The local floodplain administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it. 
(3)	Manufactured homes. 
a.	Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or sub-division, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.	Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions for residential construction in section 35-52(1) of this chapter must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower three feet than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least 36 inches or less above the grade at the sight, reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength shall support the chassis. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is required. 
d.	An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local floodplain administrator and the local emergency preparedness coordinator. 
(4)	Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.	Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, 
2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening, 
3.	Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area. 
4.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
5.	Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.	Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized. 
c.	Enclosures below lowest floor. 
1.	Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
2.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.	One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4). 
4.	All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in subsections (1), (2) and (3) should be of flood-resistant materials. 
(5)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 35-3, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a.	No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless; 
1.	It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local floodplain administrator. 
2.	A Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the proposed development. 
b.	If subsection (a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III. 
c.	Stream crossings for any purpose (i.e. timber harvesting operations), if temporary, shall be permitted in accordance with floodway requirements of subsection (5). Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III. 
d.	No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection (3) are met. 
e.	Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact certification. The uses listed in this sub-section are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the floodway configuration. 
(6)	Recreational vehicles. 
a.	A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is: 
1.	On wheels or jacking system; 
2.	Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices; and 
3.	Have no permanently attached additions. 
b.	Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be: 
1.	On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and 
2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the development permit and certification requirements of section 35-33, general standards outlined in section 35-51, and manufacture homes standards in subsections (3) and (4). 
(7)	Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures that flood maps, studies and other data identified in section 35-3. accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance activities are identified: 
a.	Requirement to submit new technical data. 
1.	For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as practicable, but no later than six months of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals include; but not limited to: 
i.	Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries; 
ii.	Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard area; 
iii.	Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and 
iv.	Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with section 35-53. 
2.	It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data, required in accordance with subsection (7), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the applicant.

Sec. 35-72. - Right to appeal. 
    Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the court. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-73. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair of rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-74. - Functionally dependent uses. 
    Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety. 
Sec. 35-75. - Agricultural structures. 
    Variances may be issued to wet flood proof an agricultural structure in accordance with Technical Bulletin 7-93, Wet Floodproofing Requirements for Structures Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program, document number FIA-TB-7, dated 12/93, and available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure must meet all of the conditions and considerations of section 35-78, this section, and the following standards: 
(1)	Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a.	Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment; 
b.	Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs; 
c.	General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that are open on at least one side; 
d.	For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of section 35-52(2) of this chapter; and 
(2)	The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base flood elevation. 
(3)	The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood velocities exceed five feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls. 
(4)	The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of section 35-52(4) of this chapter. 
(5)	Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation (BFE) plus any required freeboard, so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 35-51(5) of this chapter. 
6)	The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of section 35-52(5) of this chapter. 
    Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include protective watertight flood proofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-76. - Considerations. 
    In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)	the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)	the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3)	the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)	the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)	the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)	the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)	the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(8)	the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9)	the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10)	Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the structure are available. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-77. - Findings. 
    Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-78. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to insure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100 percent of the cost to perform the development. 
(Ord. No. 18-2014, 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 35-79. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1)	Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)	Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)	The local floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(6)	Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Violations must be corrected in accordance with section 35-55. of this chapter.

(1)	The property has received historic designation; 
(2)	The proposed rehabilitation work receives approval from the board of architectural review (BAR); 
(3)	For projects that commence on or after approval date, preliminary certification must be received prior to beginning work. To receive final certification, a property must have met the following conditions: 
a.	The property has received preliminary certification; 
b.	The minimum expenditures for rehabilitation were incurred and paid; 
c.	The completed rehabilitation receives approval from the secretary to the BAR as being consistent with the plans approved by BAR as part of preliminary certification.

(1)	The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as a contributing property in a district; 
(2)	The property is at least 50 years old and is designated as a historic property or a contributing property in a local district as designated by city council and listed in chapter 38, Historic Preservation, article II, section 38-47 and article III, section 38-83 of the City of Greer Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 12-2011, 7-26-2011) 
Sec. 38-91. - Eligible rehabilitation. 
(a)	Standards for review of rehabilitation work: To be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic rehabilitations must be appropriate for the historic building and the historic district it is located. This is achieved through adherence to the following standards: 
(1)	The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved; the removal of historic materials or alterations of features and spaces that characterize each property shall be avoided; 
(2)	Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use; changes that create a false sense of historical development shall not be undertaken; 
(3)	Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved; 
(4)	Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved; 
(5)	Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced; where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new should match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials; replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence; 
(6)	Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used; the surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible; 
(7)	New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property; the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the historic property and its environment; 
(8)	New additions and adjacent new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(b)	Work to be reviewed: The following work will be reviewed according to the standards set forth above: 
(1)	Repairs to the exterior of the designated building; 
(2)	Alterations to the exterior of the designated building; 
(3)	New construction on the property on which the building is located; 
(4)	Alterations to interior primary public spaces; 
(5)	Any remaining work where the expenditures for such work are being used to satisfy the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. 
(c)	Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation means the owner or his estate rehabilitates the building, with expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding 20 percent up to 100 percent of the fair market value of the building. Fair market value means the appraised value from the county tax assessor as certified by the BAR. 
(d)	Special assessment period: To be determined by the amount of expenditures as shown with systematic techniques below: 
(1)	20%-29% expenditures five years assessment 
(2)	30%-39% expenditures 10 years assessment 
(3)	40%-49% expenditures 15 years assessment

(e)	Expenditures for rehabilitation means the actual costs of rehabilitation relating to one or more of the following: 
(1)	Improvements located on or within the historic building as designated; 
(2)	Improvements outside of but directly attached to the historic building which are necessary to make the building fully useable (such as vertical circulation) but shall not include rentable/habitable floor space attributable to new construction;

(4)	Costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity of the building. 
(f)	The special tax assessment may apply to the following: 
(1)	Structure(s) rehabilitated; 
(2)	Real property on which the building is located. 
(g)	Time limits: To be eligible for the special tax assessment, rehabilitations must be completed within two years of the preliminary certification date. If the project is not complete after two years, but the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred, the property may continue to receive the special assessment until the project is completed, with the prerequisite of recertification by the BAR. 
(Ord. No. 12-2011, 7-26-2011) 
Sec. 38-92. - Process. 
(a)	Fee required: There is a fee of $150.00 required for final certification for each application for review of rehabilitation work conducted pursuant to this ordinance. Final certification will not be awarded without payment of this fee. 
(b)	Plan required: Owners of property seeking approval of rehabilitation work must complete a rehabilitation historic property application with supporting documentation prior to beginning work. 
(c)	Preliminary certification: Upon receipt of the completed application the proposal shall be placed on the next available agenda of the BAR to determine if the project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation in subsection 38-91(c) above. After the BAR makes its determination, the owner shall be notified in writing. 
    Upon receipt of this determination the owner may: 
(1)	If the application is approved, begin rehabilitation; 
(2)	If the application is not approved, they may revise such application in accordance with comments provided by the BAR; 
(3)	If the application is not approved, they may appeal the decision of the BAR by the following the process provided by state law (South Carolina Code of Laws, §§ 6-29-890 through 6-29-940). 
(d)	Substantive changes: Once preliminary certification is granted to an application, substantive changes must be approved by the BAR. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from eligibility. Additional expenditures will not qualify the project for an extension on the special assessment. 
(e)	Final certification: Upon completion of the project, the project must receive final certification in order to be eligible for the special assessment. The secretary to the BAR will inspect completed projects to determine if the work is consistent with the approval granted by the BAR pursuant to section 38-91 above. Final certification will be granted when the completed work meets the standards and verification is made that expenditures have been made in accordance with subsections 38-91(c) and (d). Upon receiving final certification, the property will be assessed for the remainder of the special assessment period on the fair market value of the property at the time the preliminary certification was made or the final certification was made, whichever occurred earlier. 
(f)	Additional work: For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, the property owner shall notify the BAR of any additional work, other than ordinary maintenance. The BAR shall review the work at a regularly scheduled hearing and determine whether the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent, the property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work. 
(g)	Decertification: When the property has received final certification and assessed as rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and must be granted the special assessment until the property becomes disqualified by any one of the following: 
(1)	Written notice by the owner to the BAR and the auditor to remove the preferential assessment; 
(2)	Sale or transfer of ownership during the special assessment period, other than in ordinary course within probate proceedings; 
(3)	Removal of historic designation by the Greer City Council; 
(4)	Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation work by the BAR because of alterations or renovation by the owner or his estate which cause the property to no longer possess the qualities and features which made it eligible for final certification. 
    Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given immediately to the county assessor, auditor, and treasurer. 
(h)	Notification: The city shall, upon final certification of a property, notify the county assessor, auditor, and treasurer that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for the special tax assessment. 
(i)	Date effective: If an application for preliminary or final certification is filed by May 1 or the preliminary or final certification is approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. 
    The special assessment only begins in the current or future tax years as provided for in this section. In no instance may the special assessment be applied retroactively. 
(j)	Application: Once the BAR has granted the special property tax assessments authorized herein, the owner of the property shall make application to the county auditor for the special assessment provided for herein.

ARTICLE V. - DESIGN GUIDELINES 

Sec. 38-161. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to ensure, insofar as possible, that buildings or structures designated as historic shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical character of the city. In granting a certificate of appropriateness, the board shall take into account the architectural and historical significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity. 
(Code 1982, § 14.5-101; Ord. No. 27-2009, 1-12-2010) 
Sec. 38-162. - The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
    When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness for new construction, alteration, repair, or restoration, the board shall use the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as guidelines in making its decisions. In addition, the board may adopt more specific guidelines for local historic districts and local historic buildings. These guidelines serve as the basis for determining the approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application. The Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation are: 
(1)	A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)	The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)	Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)	Most properties change overtime; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)	Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize property shall be preserved. 
(6)	Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
(7)	Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)	Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)	New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)	New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

All new corporate headquarters, corporate office facilities and distribution facilities and all additions to existing corporate headquarters, corporate office facilities or distribution facilities located in the state, established or constructed, or placed in service, within the city effective in tax years beginning after 2003 are exempt from nonschool municipal ad valorem taxes for a period of five years from the time of establishment, construction or being placed in service if the cost of the new construction or additions is $50,000.00 or more and 75 or more new jobs which are fulltime or 150 or more substantially equivalent jobs are created in the state. For the purpose of this exemption, the following definitions shall apply:

Fulltime means a job requiring a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time a week for the entire normal year of company operations, or a job requiring a minimum of 35 hours of an employee's time a week for a year in which the employee was initially hired for or transferred to the state corporate headquarters, corporate office facility or distribution facility and worked at a rented facility pending construction of a corporate headquarters, corporate office facility or distribution facility.

(4)	Staff employee and staff member mean an executive, administrative or professional worker. At least 80 percent of an executive employee's business functions must involve the management of the enterprise and directing the work of at least two employees. An executive employee has the authority to hire or fire or has the authority to make recommendations related to hiring, firing, advancement and promotion decisions, and an executive employee must customarily exercise discretionary powers.

    Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend. Such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)	Green indication. 
a.	Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.	Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.	Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in section 86-266, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)	Steady yellow indication. 
a.	Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.	Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 86-266, are advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)	Steady red indication. 
a.	Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsection (3)c of this section. 
b.	Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow, and unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such arrow is shown except as provided in subsection (3)c of this section. 
c.	Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street after stopping as required by subsection (3)a or (3)b of this section. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
d.	Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 86-381, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTION 

Sec. 90-31. - Purpose and policy. 
    Recent developments in both federal and state law have created increasing and more stringent requirements upon public wastewater treatment facilities and demand compliance with severe sanctions and penalties. The purpose of this ordinance is to update requirements and to bring the ordinance into compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500) and subsequent amendments, including the Water Quality Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-4) together with the South Carolina Pollution Control Act and other state and federal statutes and regulations. 
    The ordinance sets forth uniform requirements for discharges to the POTW and enables the commission of public works (CPW) to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and the pretreatment regulations (40 CFR Part 403 and R61-9 Section 403). The objectives of this ordinance are: 
(1)	To prevent discharges to the POTW which will interfere with the operation of the POTW or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)	To prevent discharges to the POTW which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere; 
(3)	To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludge; and 
(4)	To protect CPW personnel and the general public; 
(5)	To promote economic growth including residential and industrial development; 
(6)	To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the wastewater disposal system; and 
(7)	To enable the CPW to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject. 
    This ordinance provides for the regulation of discharges to the POTW through the issuance of permits, authorizes enforcement of limitations and requirements, authorizes monitoring activities, compliance and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of expenditures. This ordinance shall apply to the CPW and to persons who are, by permit or agreement with the CPW, users of the POTW. Except as otherwise provided herein, the general manager of CPW shall administer the provisions of this ordinance.

Sec. 90-101. - Prohibited discharges. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge wastewater which causes a hazard to human life, creates a public nuisance, exceeds specific limitations set forth hereinafter, or causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all such Users of the POTW whether or not the user is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other federal, state, or local regulations or ordinances. When the general manager determines that a user is discharging such wastewater, the general manager shall advise the user of the potential impact of the discharge and develop effluent limitations for such discharge to protect the POTW. A user shall not discharge the following substances to the POTW: 
(1)	Unpolluted waters such as infiltrations/inflow to any sanitary sewer, storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, non-contact cooling water, and unpolluted industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the general manager. Uncontaminated cooling water may be discharged to the storm sewer under the jurisdiction of the CPW in accordance with applicable DHEC requirements. 
(2)	Liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. Wastewater shall have not have a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit using test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. Materials specifically prohibited from discharge into the POTW include gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, fuel oil, lubricating oil, and any other substances which the CPW, state, or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.

Sec. 90-102. - Conditionally prohibited discharges. 
    Certain discharges may be prohibited in the event the general manager determines it necessary to protect the POTW, receiving stream, or that the discharge will endanger lives, limbs, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The general manager may revise the limitations established in this section if, in his opinion, different limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Wastewater as described below shall not be discharged to the POTW without the prior written approval of the general manager. 
(1)	Grease and oils: 
a.	Wastewater containing more than 100 mg/l of Silica Gel Treated N-Hexane Extractable Material (SGT-HEM); non-polar material such as petroleum oil, cutting oils, coolants, or products of mineral oil origin.

(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015; Ord. No. 28-2015, 11-10-2015) 
Sec. 90-103. - National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or local limitations. 
    Upon the promulgation of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards for an industrial subcategory, each National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, if more stringent than the corresponding limitation imposed under this ordinance for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this ordinance. The general manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12 and SC R61-9 Section 403.12. CPW shall develop and set all limitations in accordance with applicable law and shall publish these limitations periodically. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for existing sources subject to such standards or for existing sources which hereafter become subject to such standards shall be within three years following promulgation of the standards unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the standard. Specified pollutant limitation and compliance schedules shall be developed by the general manager and made a part of the user's discharge permit. Compliance with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or local limitations for new sources shall be required within 90 days of initiation of a discharge. These specific limits and definitions of duration and maximums shall be on file at CPW's office and available upon request. A current listing of the limitations developed and set by CPW is attached as Attachment "A" to this ordinance. Future changes or additions to these limitations shall be developed, set and adopted by CPW and will be published by CPW, and when adopted by CPW be automatically incorporated into Attachment "A." 
    The general manager may allow for a categorical user to request a variance from an applicable categorical standard or local limitation. The request may be allowed when factors relating to a categorical user are fundamentally different from the factors considered during the development of a categorical pretreatment standard applicable to the categorical user. A revised standard may be allowed as follows: 
(1)	Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with paragraphs (4) and (5) of this section. 
(2)	When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the general manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(3)	When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the general manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) and SC R61-9 Section 403.6(f). 
(4)	When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that CPW convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the general manager. CPW may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth as follows: 
a.	To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.	Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
2.	Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.	Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's total actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.	Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.	Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period, at least three years, prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.	An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.	Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.	Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.	Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the general manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (4)a.3. of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the general manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.	Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (4)a.1. of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.	When developing equivalent mass limits, the general manager: 
1.	Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.	Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.	May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 90-106 below. The industrial user must also be in compliance with section 90-111 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(5)	The general manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits [SC R61-9 Section 403.6 (d)(5)] for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. When converting such limits to concentration limits, the concentrations in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 shall be applied. Also, documentation shall be provided that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited under section 90-106 of this ordinance. The conversion is at the discretion of the general manager. 
(6)	Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(7)	Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(8)	Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the general manager within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the general manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(9)	The general manager, at his discretion may reduce or waive categorical pretreatment standards if an industrial user subject to the categorical pretreatment standards is determined to be a non-significant categorical user. The general manager may determine that an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a non-significant categorical industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following conditions are met: 
a.	The industrial user, prior to the general manager's finding, has consistently complied with all applicable categorical and pretreatment standards and requirements; 
b.	The industrial user annually submits the required certification statement and any necessary supporting information; and 
c.	The industrial user never discharges any untreated, concentrated wastewater.

Sec. 90-104. - Limitations on wastewater strength and flow rate. 
    No person shall discharge wastewater in excess of the concentration or mass limit set forth in National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or local limitations or their wastewater discharge permit. The general manager shall establish permit limitations on a case-by-case basis in accordance with DHEC and EPA regulations and an approved headworks analysis. Where appropriate and allowed by applicable regulations, the general manager may impose mass limitations on a discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-105. - Revision of limitations. 
    The general manager may impose limitations more stringent than the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards in wastewater discharge permits where it is necessary to comply with the objectives of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-106. - Dilution prohibition. 
    Except where authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard, no user shall deliberately dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations developed by the CPW or state. This provision may be waived for National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or local limitations only if the standard or requirements specifically allow dilution and the general manager determines the discharge would otherwise comply with the provisions of this ordinance.

    The general manager may require an industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this ordinance. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the expense of the owner. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the general manager for review, and shall be approved before construction of the facility. No person who commences discharge to the POTW after the effective date of this ordinance shall be permitted to discharge until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the general manager. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this ordinance. In the case of an accidental discharge or a slug load, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately notify the general manager of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
    Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug load, the user shall submit to the general manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater disposal system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this ordinance or other applicable law. 
    The accidental discharge/slug control plan when required shall be submitted to the general manager containing at a minimum the following: 
(1)	Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges. 
(2)	Description of stored chemicals. 
(3)	Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge or change at its facility affecting potential for a slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges. 
(4)	Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structure or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
    The general manager will evaluate within one year of a user being designated a significant industrial user, whether the user needs a plan, and thereafter at least once every three years. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-108. - Upset provision, an affirmative defense. 
(a)	Definition. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)	Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met. 
(c)	Conditions necessary for demonstrating upset. Any user which experiences an upset in operations which places the user in a temporary state of noncompliance shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.16 and SC R61-9 Section 403.16 if the user seeks to establish an affirmative defense of upset. The following information must be given to the general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if given orally, written submission must follow up within five days: 
(1)	Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the expected impact on the user's compliance status; 
(2)	Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur; and 
(3)	All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(d)	User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-109. - Notice of process change/interruption of operation. 
    Notice by the user shall be given to the general manager in advance or at the earliest possible time when normal operations of the industry as identified by the industry in its permit application will be interrupted for 48 hours or longer, when wastewater will not be discharged, or prior to implementation of a process change which will alter characteristics of the wastewater. 
Sec. 90-110. - Pretreatment. 
(a)	Pretreatment measures. Users shall provide pretreatment as required to comply with this ordinance or discharge permit, and shall achieve compliance with this ordinance and all pretreatment standards within the specified time limitations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be constructed, operated, and maintained as the expense of the owner. A permit to construct pretreatment facilities shall be obtained from DHEC. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the general manager for review. Submittal of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the general manager under the provisions of this ordinance. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the general manager and approved or permitted by DHEC prior to the initiation of the changes. 
(b)	Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)	Whenever deemed necessary, the general manager may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and /or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(2)	A significant industrial user may be required to install and maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow over a period determined by the general manager. The facility shall have a reasonable capacity for the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the general manager. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)	Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the general manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall be not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the general manager and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, repaired and replaced as needed, by the owner at his expense. 
(4)	Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-111. - Bypass, affirmative defense. 
    Any user which bypasses treatment facilities as defined in 40 CFR 403.17 and SC R61-9 Section 403.17 shall comply with the requirements of that section and applicable state and federal regulations. An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur only when it does not cause National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the general manager, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the general manager within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The general manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
    The general manager may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, except where the user establishes an affirmative defense of bypass. For this affirmative defense the user must show the following: 
(1)	Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage: 
(2)	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastewater, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)	The industrial user submitted notices as required in this section. 
    The general manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects if the general manager determines that it will meet the conditions listed in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2-2015, 2-24-2015) 
Sec. 90-112. - Recovery of preventive expenses. 
    When any discharge in the opinion of the general manager appears to be in violation of division 4, prohibitions and limitations on wastewater discharges, to the extent that the discharge may cause an interference with, or have an adverse impact upon, the operation of facilities, the CPW may act to take preventative action. All costs and expenses, losses and damages, including the reasonable value or cost of the use of CPW personnel and equipment caused or incurred by the implementation of preventative measures shall be charged to and paid by the discharger.

Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
    The general manager shall review the application, conduct an on-site inspection of the plant and any pretreatment facilities, and shall prepare a written evaluation and tentative determination to issue or deny the permit. If the tentative determination is to issue the permit, the general manager shall draft the permit in accordance with the ordinance and state regulations. A synopsis of the application shall be prepared by the general manager for submission to the applicant, the DHEC, and to the public upon request. The contents of such shall include a sketch or detailed description of the process if not in violation of section 90-155 on confidentiality and pretreatment facilities including the location of all points of discharge to the POTW and all compliance monitoring points. This shall also include the rate or frequency of the proposed discharge, average daily flow, average daily discharge in pounds or any limited pollutant and any pollutant identified in the application as known or suspected present, and the basis for the pretreatment limitations including the documentation of any calculations in applying National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or local limitations, and all other information required by the state. The user shall have 30 days from the receipt of the draft permit to review and comment on the draft permit. The general manager shall issue the final permit at the end of the comment period. 
(b)	Hearings. Any person whose permit is denied, or is granted subject to conditions he deems unacceptable, shall have the right to request an adjudicatory hearing under the procedures provided in division 8 and the enforcement management strategy, Attachment "C," mutatis mutandis, except insofar as that procedure relates to appeals from the decision of the hearing examiner. After a determination is made by the hearing examiner in any case other than an enforcement proceeding, any party may apply to the commission for a review of the determination of the hearing examiner prior to a final decision in the matter by the commission. However, application must be submitted in writing within 15 days of receipt of the determination stating specifically the grounds of objection to such determination. The commission may on its own motion take up the review of the review of the determination of the hearing examiner at a regularly scheduled commission meeting. On the basis of the complete record of proceedings and testimony and evidence presented before the hearing examiner, his or her determination shall be affirmed, modified, or set aside by the commission in a final decision on the matter. 
    The commission will review the determination of the hearing examiner in the following manner: 
(1)	Briefs may be submitted to the commission by the parties but are not required unless specifically requested by the commission. 
(2)	All briefs shall be submitted to the commission at least 15 days prior to the scheduled meeting with ten separate copies. Briefs shall state specifically the grounds for affirmation, modification, or denial of the determination of the hearing examiner. Reply briefs may be filed five days before the commission meeting. 
(3)	Oral arguments shall be limited in duration to not more than one hour, or as otherwise provided by the commission, from each party in the hearing, including intervening parties. 
(4)	A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings and reported and transcribed by a qualified reporter furnished by the CPW. A copy of the transcript may be requested by any interested party, who shall pay the cost of preparing such transcript. 
(5)	The commission, at its discretion may require a reopening of the adjudicatory hearing before the hearing examiner for the taking of additional testimony upon all issues or particular issues prior to its final decision on the determination of the hearing examiner. 
(6)	The commission will make its decision upon the record presented by the hearing examiner alone, unless the commission determines it needs additional evidence during its consideration. In such event a proper opportunity for rebuttal by the party will be granted. 
    Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the commission, other than in an enforcement case, may appeal such decision to the court of common pleas in the county in which the commission is located under the same guidelines applied to state agencies which are set forth in S.C. Code 1976, § 1-23-380. 
(c)	Permit modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or adoption of a local limitation, the permit of users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or local limitation, has not previously submitted an application for a permit, the user shall apply for a permit within 180 days after the promulgation of the pretreatment standard. In addition, the user with an existing permit shall submit to the CPW within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable standard information regarding the nature and concentration of the regulated pollutant and a schedule for providing additional pretreatment, if necessary. 
    Other modifications of permits shall be subject to the same procedural requirements as the issuance of permits except the following changes may be made upon 30 days' notice: 
(1)	Modifications of the monitoring program contained in the permit; 
(2)	Changes in the ownership of the discharge when no other change in the permit is indicated; 
(3)	A single modification of any compliance schedule not in the excess of four months; or 
(4)	Modification of compliance schedules in permits for new sources where the new source will not discharge until process or pretreatment facilities are operational; 
(5)	Modifications incorporating new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standards or regulations; or 
(6)	Other modifications determined necessary by the general manager under the regulations. 
(d)	Permit conditions. The general manager shall have the authority to grant a permit with such conditions attached as he believes necessary to achieve the purpose of this ordinance, state, and federal regulations. Such conditions shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(1)	A statement of duration (in no case more than five years); 
(2)	A statement of non-transferability; 
(3)	Applicable effluent limits based on National Categorical Standards or local limitations; 
(4)	Applicable monitoring and reporting requirements; 
(5)	Notification requirements for slug discharges as defined by 40 CFR Part 403.5(b), and SC R61-9 Section 403.5(b); 
(6)	A statement of applicable penalties for violation of permit conditions; and 
(7)	A compliance schedule that outlines dates and actions for obtaining compliance with final limitations or other pretreatment requirements. 
(e)	Permit duration. Permits may be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit re-issuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the permit. 
(f)	Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation. In such event a new application shall be submitted with full information. This application will be expedited if the new owner or operator certifies (1) that there is no immediate intent to change the facility's operation and process, and (2) the date the new owner or operator shall take over, and (3) acknowledgement is made that the new owner or operator has full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit.

Sec. 90-152. - Reporting requirements for permittee. 
(a)	Within 180 days after the effective date of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6 and SC R61-9 Section 403.6 (b) whichever is later, existing significant industrial users (currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW) subject to such National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, shall be required to submit to the general manager a report which contains the information required in 40 CFR 403.12 and SC R61-9 Section 403.12(b) and applicable state and federal regulations. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become significant industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, shall be required to submit to the general manager a report which contains the information required in 40 CFR 403.12 and SC R61-9 Section 403.12(b). A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. The general manager shall require appropriate reporting from those significant industrial users not subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Reports required by this ordinance shall be signed by an authorized representative of the significant industrial user. 
(b)	Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the discharge of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the general manager a report containing the information required in 40 CFR 403.12 and SC R61-9 Section 403.12(b). 
(c)	Any user subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of such National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the general manager no less than twice per year unless required more frequently in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or by the general manager, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. At the discretion of the general manager and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the general manager may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. The general manager may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the required periodic reports shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate, in the discharge of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the general manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the permit or applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
(d)	The general manager may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. The authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)	The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)	The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)	In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4)	The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by a duly authorized representative and include the certification statement in section 90-153 below. 
(5)	Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6)	Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the general manager must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the general manager for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
(7)	Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the general manager, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in section 90-153 below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastewater due to activities of the industrial user. 
(8)	In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (c) above, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the general manager and notify the general manager. 
(9)	This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards such as baseline monitoring reports and 90-day report of final compliance with the pretreatment standard, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. The waiver is not available when the combined waste stream formula is applied except where a single categorical waste stream is combined only with sanitary wastewater. 
(e)	All users shall notify the general manager immediately of discharges that could cause problems, including any slug discharges. 
(f)	Sampling and analysis may be performed by the CPW in lieu of the user. If done by the CPW, the user shall be charged such fees or charges as are established by the CPW. Where the CPW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the user, the user shall not be required to submit the compliance certification required under 40 CFR 403.12(b) (6) and 403.12(d) and SC R61-9 Section 403.12(b) and 403.12(d). In addition, where the CPW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the user shall not be required to submit the report. 
(g)	If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the CPW within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user may not be required to resample if the CPW performs or requires sampling of the discharge at a frequency of at least once per month, or the CPW performs sampling between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(h)	If a user subject to these reporting requirements monitors any pollutant at the location(s) designated in the discharge permit more frequently than required by the general manager, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(i)	The general manager shall require appropriate reporting from those users with discharges that are not subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Significant industrial users shall submit to the general manager at least once every six months (on dates specified by the general manager) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the general manager. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the CPW in lieu of the non-categorical significant industrial user. Where the CPW itself collects all the information required for the report, the significant industrial user shall not be required to submit the report. 
(j)	Significant industrial users shall promptly notify the general manager in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge in excess of the amounts allowed in the discharge described in the application or the permit, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12 and SC R61-9 Section 403.12. Significant industrial users shall notify the general manager, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge of a substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the significant industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the significant industrial user: (1) an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; (2) an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastewater discharged during that calendar month; and (3) an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastewater expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. significant industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Notification need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j) and SC R61-9 Section 403.12(j). 
    The notification requirement does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e) and SC R61-9 Section 403.12 (b), (d) and (e). Users are exempt from the requirements during a calendar month in which they discharge no more that 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification.

Sec. 90-361. - Applicability. 
    Stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plans shall be required for any new residential development or subdivision, and for any new commercial, industrial, institutional or utility development. No subdivision plat or site plan shall be approved by the planning commission and no building permits shall be issued until and unless the stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plans have been reviewed and approved by the city engineer and applicable permits issued. A plan review fee, calculated using the formula found in the engineering review fee schedule, shall be charged for each plan reviewed. Although multiple reviews may be required for each plan prior to plan approval, the maximum time period between each review shall be no longer than 30 business days. 
    Plans are not required for single-family homes where a subdivision plat is not required provided: 
(1)	Disturbed lots are protected with gravel entrances and properly installed and functioning silt fencing. 
(2)	Stormwater runoff does not damage downstream structures, or offsite areas. 
(3)	Land disturbance is less than one acre. 
    Plan review and approvals for sites that disturb less than one acre and that are not part of a larger common plan will proceed under the City of Greer Grading Permit and Plan, review process. Based on the complexity of the site the city engineer will determine whether or not a complete stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plan, (plan) is required or if a simplified plan will suffice. Upon satisfactory completion of the plan review process a City of Greer grading permit may be granted. 
    For site plans that disturb one acre of land or greater and those that disturb less than one acre that are part of a larger common plan, all of the requirements of a stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plan apply. Upon satisfactory completion of the plan review process, the city engineer will authorize the issuance of an approval letter. The approval letter and the original notice of intent (NOI), will be sent to S.C. DHEC's stormwater permitting section with the recommendation of the issuance of coverage under the "NPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Large and Small Construction Activities" (construction general permit, CGP) for the described land disturbing activity. Once the coverage under the construction general permit is obtained from DHEC and performance surety is posted a City of Greer grading permit may be granted. 
    The required stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plan shall identify means for controlling the stormwater runoff release rate from the development, providing storage or infiltration for the excess stormwater runoff where required, reducing velocity, controlling sediment/erosion and providing water quality treatment. All computations, plans, and specifications related to the implementation of this article must be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional engineer, Tier B land surveyor or landscape architect registered in the State of South Carolina. 
    The stormwater management and sediment/erosion control plan shall contain but not be limited to the information listed in section 90-349, unless specifically excluded by the city engineer.

Sec. 90-364. - Requirements; construction. 
    Sediment and erosion control shall be established on applicable land disturbing sites by both nonstructural and structural controls or best management practices (BMPs). Structural controls include but are not limited to, silt fencing, check dams, slope drains, construction entrances, sediment traps, sediment basins, inlet protection, and stabilization. Nonstructural controls include but are not limited to, plan development, plan modification, phasing and sequencing. 
(1)	Plan submission: A plan that adequately addresses sediment and erosion control, dust control, and management of additional wastes or spills must be submitted to the City of Greer. Plan requirements are as outlined in section 90-349 and may be amended from time to time. 
(2)	For sites that disturb ten acres or more and whose stormwater runoff drains to a single outlet, sediment and erosion shall be controlled by a sediment basin. The sediment basin shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the anticipated soil loading from the land disturbing activity and meet a removal efficiency of 80 percent suspended solids. The outfall device or system design shall take into account the total drainage area flowing through the disturbed area to be served by the basin. The 80 percent suspended solids removal efficiency shall be calculated using the applicable ten-year 24-hour storm event. 
(3)	For sites whose stormwater runoff is from land disturbing activities less than ten acres, other methods of sediment removal may be acceptable provided 80 percent removal of suspended solids is achieved.

(Ord. No. 28-2007, § 1, 8-28-2007) 
Sec. 90-365. - Construction/post-construction-Water quality. 
(a)	Water quality treatment of stormwater runoff is required for all sites whose land disturbing activity is greater than five acres. The City of Greer reserves the right to require water quality treatment of stormwater runoff for sites whose land disturbing activity is less than five acres, if a concern for impact to water quality exists. This requirement exists whether or not the stormwater discharges to impaired water. 
(b)	Impaired waters: For sites whose stormwater runoff discharges to a receiving water that is listed as impaired in South Carolina's 303(d) list of impaired waters, the following requirements apply: 
(1)	If a total maximum daily load (TMDL) that is applicable to stormwater construction discharges has been established and is in effect then the applicant must follow the TMDL requirements found in Part 1.3C4 of the construction general permit. 
(2)	If a TMDL for the impaired receiving water either has not been established or is not in effect the applicant must ensure that stormwater discharges from this project will not contribute to violations of the water quality standard. If the stormwater discharges do not contain the pollutant of concern no additional requirement is necessary. Where the stormwater discharge does contain the pollutant(s) of concern the applicant must ensure that stormwater discharges will not contribute or cause a violation of water quality standards. A BMP directed at the pollutant of concern must also be included in the plan. For projects that disturb 25 acres of land or more the plan must contain a written quantitative and qualitative assessment that the BMPs selected will control stormwater discharges sufficiently so that they will not cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards. 
(c)	TMDL information requested on the notice of intent (NOI) must be completed by the design professional. 
(d)	Permanent water quality ponds and water quality structures having a permanent pool elevation shall be designed to store and release the first one-half inch of runoff from the site over a minimum period of 24 hours.

(e)	Permanent water quality structures that do not have a permanent pool elevation shall be designed to store and release the first one inch of runoff from the site over a minimum period of 24 hours. 
(f)	Permanent water quality infiltration practices shall be designed to accommodate at a minimum the first inch of runoff from impervious areas located on the site. 
(g)	Water quality calculations including pollutants removed and removal efficiencies must be included in the plan whose requirements are specified in section 90-349. Design details and installation instructions for water quality devices must be included on the site plan detail sheets. A maintenance plan and schedule for the water quality device must also be submitted with the plan. 
(h)	Upon completion of the project the engineer of record shall certify that the water quality structure or device was installed according to the approved plans. 
(Ord. No. 28-2007, § 1, 8-28-2007) 
Sec. 90-366. - Post-construction-Stormwater quantity and direction of flow. 
    Water quantity control is an integral part of overall stormwater management. The increased stormwater runoff resulting from the proposed development may be accommodated by the provision of appropriate detention facilities including wet or dry bottom reservoirs, flat roofs, constructed wetlands, or underground storage. Additional methods may be approved provided adequate detention is achieved and supporting calculations and documentation are provided. The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to managing stormwater runoff: 
(1)	Release rate. 
a.	Post development peak discharge rates shall not exceed predevelopment discharge rates for the applicable two-, ten-, and 25-year frequency, 24-hour duration storm event. 
b.	In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the downstream channel or storm sewer system. If in the opinion of the applicant, professional engineer, Tier B surveyor or landscape architect, damage downstream of the development might occur as the result of the development, then the applicant must make downstream improvements that are necessary to mitigate damages or increase on-site detention. Information related to the problems of concern may be obtained from the natural resources conservation service, FEMA, a flood analysis prepared by a flood mapping service, etc. Ultimately, it is the design professional's responsibility to identify and mitigate such areas of concern. 
c.	Watersheds that have documented water quantity problems may have more stringent design criteria as determined by the city engineer. 
(2)	Storage volume. The minimum volume of storage potential provided in detention facilities shall be sufficient to control the excess stormwater runoff, as determined to be the difference between the stormwater quantity from the site in its developed state for a 10-year, 24-hour frequency rainfall as published by the U.S. Weather Bureau less the ten-year runoff quantity from the site prior to development. This volume may be increased as necessary to meet the requirements of the release rate criteria found in the paragraph above. 
(3)	Discharge velocity. Stormwater runoff shall be controlled to a nonerosive velocity both during and after construction. Velocity dissipation measures shall be used to provide a nonerosive velocity flow to maintain existing hydrology conditions of watercourses. Storm sewer outfalls shall be designed to provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scouring as the result of the discharge from the development/redevelopment. 
(4)	Discharge direction. Post-construction discharge shall be in the same direction and ratio as that before construction. 
(5)	Spillway. Emergency spillways shall be provided and located in a manner as to permit the safe passage of runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour storm. 
(6)	Freeboard. Detention facilities shall, have adequate capacity to contain the storage volume of stormwater runoff with at least one-half foot of freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency spillway in a 100-year storm. 
(7)	Fencing. Ground reservoir detention facilities with a depth greater than 24 inches shall be enclosed within a permanent four-foot high fence; provided, that this requirement may be waived on a case-by-case basis when the detention facility is within an area that is totally enclosed by a fence. All detention facilities shall be landscaped on the outside of the fence or reservoir by a screen of the owner's choosing, including berms, trees, shrubbery, etc. 
Fencing shall not be required when the detention pond is a wet pond utilized as an amenity. 
(8)	Design for access and maintenance. Design of stormwater ponds and location of stormwater management and quality structures shall be sufficient to provide safe access by manpower and equipment for routine and nonroutine maintenance of the pond bottom, slopes and stormwater management/quality structures. Maintenance access routes to stormwater ponds and structures shall lie within dedicated storm sewer easements. 
(9)	Natural drainageways. Natural drainageways shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable in carrying stormwater runoff provided its use remains consistent with the purpose of this article.

(b)	No city police officer shall hold any financial interest or any form of ownership interest in any wrecker service.

(j)	Separate rotation lists shall be maintained for heavy duty wreckers. Where the services of a heavy duty wrecker are needed and where the owner or driver has no preference as to which wrecker service he desires, a heavy duty wrecker shall be called from the heavy duty wrecker rotation list.

Section 5:12 Flood Prevention
Section 5:12.1 General Standards
A. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in SC Code of Laws,
Title 5, Chapters 7, 23, and 25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Chapter 7,
and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of
Greer, South Carolina does ordain as follows:
B. Statement of Purpose and Objectives.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction
practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by
requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase
flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These
provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging
and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
Additionally, the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of
flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
The objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health, to
help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that
property is in a flood area. The provisions of the ordinance are intended
to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important
floodplain management objective of this ordinance is to minimize
expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue
and relief efforts associated with flooding.
Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital
natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation
of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are
best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state.
47
Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their
associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced.
Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels,
should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource
conditions and human needs.
C. Lands to Which this Ordinance Applies.
This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City of Greer as identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study, dated December 2,
2004 with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. Upon
annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study for the
unincorporated areas of Greenville and Spartanburg County, with
accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared
part of this ordinance.
D. Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall
be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to
the commencement of any development activities.
E. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms
of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
F. Interpretation In the interpretation and application of this ordinance
all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally
construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit
nor repeal any other powers granted under State law. This ordinance is
not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
G. Partial Invalidity and Severability If any part of this Ordinance is
declared invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected and
shall remain in force.
H. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
48
required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration.

lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable
flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict
evaporation from below and materials that are impervious, but
dimensionally unstable are not acceptable. Materials that absorb
or retain water excessively after submergence are not floodresistant.
Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2-93, Flood-Resistant
Materials for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas in
Accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program, document

flood level for purposes of flood plain management. Freeboard
tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a
selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action,
bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
watershed.
25.Functionally dependent facility - a facility which cannot be
used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in

programs. Some structures or districts listed on the State or local
inventories MAY NOT be "Historic" as cited above, but have been
included on the inventories because it was believed that the
structures or districts have the potential for meeting the "Historic"
structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet
NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and
evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and
History has individually determined that the structure or district
meets DOI historic structure criteria.
28.Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC)  applies to all new and
renewed flood insurance policies effective on and after June 1,
1997. The NFIP shall enable the purchase of insurance to cover the
cost of compliance with land use and control measures established
under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the payment of a
claim to help pay for the cost to comply with State or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in
which a building has been declared substantially or repetitively
damaged.

a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood
damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market
value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
41.Section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 -
The act provides that no new flood insurance shall be provided for
any property found by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to have been declared by a state or local authority to be in
violation of state or local ordinances.
42.Start of construction - (for other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act
(P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual
start means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers
or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

home, including a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made
facility or infrastructure that is principally above ground.
44.Substantial damage - damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before
damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Such
repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted
cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of "substantial
improvement".
55
45.Substantial improvement - any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
a) any project of improvement to a structure to correct
existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local
code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include
American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or,
b) any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure.
c) Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If
the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of
all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the
issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine
whether "substantial improvement" will occur.
46.Substantially improved existing manufactured home park
or subdivision - where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds
50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the
repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.

9. Map Interpretation - Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard
(for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions), make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this article.
10.Prevailing Authority  Where a map boundary showing an area
of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base
flood elevations for flood protection elevations (as found on an
elevation profile, floodway data table, etc.) shall prevail. The
correct information should be submitted to FEMA as per the map
maintenance activity requirements outlined in Section 5:12.4.B.7.b.

Department of Natural Resources Land, Water and Conservation
Division, within six (6) months, of any annexations or detachments
that include special flood hazard areas. The community must
incorporate applicable maps from surrounding jurisdictions into
this ordinance within 90 days of date of the annexation.
17.Federally Funded Development - The President issued
Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management May 1977. E.O.
11988 directs federal agencies to assert a leadership role in
reducing flood losses and losses to environmental values served
by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eightstep
review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive
order must be submitted as part of the permit review process.
18.Substantial Damage Determination  Perform an assessment
of damage from any origin to the structure using FEMAs
Residential Substantial Damage Estimator (RSDE) software to
determine if the damage equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
19.Substantial Improvement Determinations  Perform an
assessment of permit applications for improvements or repairs to
be made to a building or structure equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair
is started. Cost of work counted for determining if and when
substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative
for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted
in phases the total of all cost associated with each phase,
beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to
determine whether substantial improvement will occur.
a) Methods of Market Value Determination. The market
values shall be determined by one of the following
methods:
62
(1) the current assessed building value as
determined by the countys assessors office or
the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed
appraiser at the expense of the owner; or,
(2) one or more certified appraisals from a
registered professional licensed appraiser in
accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The
appraisal shall indicate actual replacement value
of the building or structure in its preimprovement
condition, less depreciation for
functionality and obsolescence and site
improvements. The Marshall & Swift Residential
Cost Handbook shall be used to determine costs
for buildings or structures.
(3) Real Estate purchase contract within 12
months prior to the date of the application for a
permit.
F. Administrative Procedures.
1. Inspections of Work in Progress: As the work pursuant to a
permit progresses, the local administrator shall make as many
inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the
work is being done according to the provisions of the local
ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising this power,
the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper
credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection
or other enforcement action.
2. Stop-Work Orders: Whenever a building or part thereof is
being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation
of this ordinance, the administrator may order the work to be
immediately stopped. The stop-work order shall be in writing and
directed to the person doing the work. The stop-work order shall
state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the
stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be
resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a
misdemeanor.
3. Revocation of Permits: The local administrator may revoke
and require the return of the development permit by notifying the
permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation.
Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the
approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure
63
to comply with the requirements of State or local laws; or for false
statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit.
Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable State or
local law may also be revoked.
4. Periodic Inspections: The local administrator and each
member of his inspections department shall have a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within
the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable
hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
5. Violations to be Corrected: When the local administrator
finds violations of applicable State and local laws, it shall be his
duty to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the
violation. The owner or occupant shall immediately remedy each
of the violations of law on the property he owns.
6. Actions in Event of Failure to Take Corrective Action: If the
owner of a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective
action, the administrator shall give him written notice, by certified
or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service,
that:
a) the building or property is in violation of the Flood
Damage Prevention Ordinance,
b) a hearing will be held before the local administrator at a
designated place and time, not later than 10 days after the
date of the notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled
to be heard in person or by counsel and to present
arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and,
c) following the hearing, the local administrator may issue
such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to
remove fill as appears appropriate.
7. Order to Take Corrective Action: If, upon a hearing held
pursuant to the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall
find that the building or development is in violation of the Flood
Damage Prevention Ordinance, he shall make an order in writing to
the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such
period, not less than 60 days, the administrator may prescribe;
provided that where the administrator finds that there is imminent
danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective
action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
8. Appeal: Any owner who has received an order to take
corrective action may appeal from the order to the local elected
64
governing body by giving notice of appeal in writing to the
administrator and the clerk within 10 days following issuance of
the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the
administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear an
appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and
affirm, or revoke the order.
9. Failure to Comply with Order: If the owner of a building or
property fails to comply with an order to take corrective action
from which no appeal has been taken, or fails to comply with an
order of the governing body following an appeal, he shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the discretion of the
court.
10. Denial of Flood Insurance under the NFIP If a structure is
declared in violation of this ordinance and the violation is not
remedied then the local administrator shall notify the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to initiate a Section 1316 of the
National Flood insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure
upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation
into compliance with the ordinance. Once a violation has been
remedied the local administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy
and ask that the Section 1316 be rescinded.
11. The following documents are incorporated by reference and
may be used by the local administrator to provide further guidance
and interpretation of this ordinance as found on FEMAs website at
www.fema.gov:

3. FEMA 348 Protecting Building Utilities from Flood Damage
Section 5:12.4 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
A. General Standards. Development may not occur in the floodplain
where alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks
involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that
new structures cannot be located out of the floodplain and that
encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. In all areas of special
flood hazard the following provisions are required:
1. Anchoring - All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure,
2. Flood Resistant Materials and Equipment - All new
construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to
65
flood damage,
3. Minimize Flood Damage - All new construction or substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that
minimize flood damages,
4. Critical Development - shall be elevated to the 500 year flood
elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood
elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no
data exists establishing the 500 year flood elevation or the highest
known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500
year flood elevation data,
5. Utilities - Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service
facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of the base flood plus 3 ft. This requirement does not
preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads,
sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and back flow devices
are installed to prevent contamination to the service components
and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building,
6. Water Supply Systems - All new and replacement water supply
systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the system,
7. Sanitary Sewage Systems  New and replacement sanitary
sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from
the systems into floodwaters,
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding,
8. Gas Or Liquid Storage Tanks  All gas or liquid storage tanks,
either located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to
prevent flotation or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads.
9. Alteration, Repair, Reconstruction, Or Improvements - Any
alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure
that is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this
ordinance. This includes post-FIRM development and structures.
66
10.Non-Conforming Buildings or Uses. Non-conforming
buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless
such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in
conformance with the provisions of this ordinance. Provided,
however, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the repair,
reconstruction, or replacement of an existing building or structure
located totally or partially within the floodway, provided that the
bulk of the building or structure below base flood elevation in the
floodway is not increased and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements
of this ordinance,
11. American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet
the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in
Section 5:12.4.B, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The
ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving
these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to
meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the
improvements for calculating substantial improvement.
B. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard ( Zones A, AE,
AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE) where base flood elevation data has been
provided, as set forth in Article I.D or outlined in the Duties and
Responsibilities of the Local Administrator Article III.E. the following
provisions are required:
1. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured
homes) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than 3 feet
above the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted.
Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with
the elevated buildings requirements in Section 5:12.4 B.4.
2. Non-Residential Construction New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential
structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the lowest
floor elevated no lower than 3 feet, above the level of the base
flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used
to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with the elevated buildings requirements in Section
5:12.4 B.4. No basements are permitted. Structures located in Azones
may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all
67
areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water,
using structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A
registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall
be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing
certification requirements in Section 5:12.3.D.2.a. Structures that
are floodproofed are required to have an approved maintenance
plan with an annual exercise. The local administrator must
approve the maintenance plan and notification of the annual
exercise shall be provided to it.
3. Manufactured Homes.
a) Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or
subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision,
in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has
incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 3
feet above the base flood elevation and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
b) Manufactured homes that are to be placed or
substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision that are not subject to the
provisions for residential construction in Section 5:12.4.B.1
of this ordinance must be elevated so that the lowest floor
of the manufactured home is elevated no lower 3 feet than
above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to
an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
c) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of
this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance
with Section 19-425.39 of the South Carolina Manufactured
Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as
amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement
would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least 36
inches or less above the grade at the sight, reinforced piers
68
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength
shall support the chassis. When the elevation of the chassis
is above 36 inches in height an engineering certification is
required.
d) An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of
all residents of all new, substantially improved or
substantially damaged manufactured home parks or
subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan
shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator
and the local Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.
4. Elevated Buildings New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed
areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building
access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude
finished space and be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
a) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet the following minimum criteria:
(1) Provide a minimum of two openings on different
walls having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding,
(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot above grade,
(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves, or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions; and,
(4) Fill placed around foundation walls must be
graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is
equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside
the building on at least one side of the building.
b) Hazardous Velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be
considered in the design of any foundation system where
velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If
flood velocities are excessive (greater than 5 feet per
second), foundation systems other than solid foundations
walls should be considered so that obstructions to
69
damaging flood flows are minimized.
c) Enclosures below BFE
(1) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage
door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or
elevator).
(2) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms,
except to enclose a single storage area and must be
void of utilities except for essential lighting as
required, and cannot be temperature controlled.
(3) One wet location switch and/or outlet connected
to a ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed
below the required lowest floor elevation specified in
the specific standards outlined in Section 5:12.4.B.1,
2 and 3.
(4) All construction materials below the required
lowest floor elevation specified in the specific
standards outlined in Section 5:12.4.B 1, 2 and 3
should be of flood resistant materials.
5. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in section 5:12.1.B, are areas designated as floodways.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles and has
erosion potential. The following provisions shall apply within such
areas:
a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, additions, and other
developments shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be
presented to the local administrator.
b) If Section 5:12.4.B.5a is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section
70
5:12.4.
c) Stream crossings for any purpose (i.e. timber harvesting
operations), if temporary, shall be permitted in accordance
with floodway requirements of Section 5:12.4.B.5 and the
temporary development provisions of Section 5:12.4.B.11.
Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV.
d) No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A
replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of
Section 5:12.4.B.3 are met.
e) Permissible uses within floodways may include: general
farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture,
forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar
agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns,
gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and
horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that
they do not employ structures or fill. Substantial
development of a permissible use may require a no-impact
certification. The uses listed in this subsection are
permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause
any increase in base flood elevations or changes to the
floodway configuration.
6. Recreational Vehicles
a) A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is:
(1) on wheels or jacking system;
(2) attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type
utilities and security devices; and,

and other proposed developments containing at least 50
lots or 5 acres, whichever is less.
e) If the areas of special flood hazard is identified as an
area of open space and is deeded as such then a hydrologic
and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates base
flood elevations for the subdivision proposal would not be
required.
f) The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit
technical data to FEMA in Section 5:12.4B.7. when a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is completed that
generates base flood elevations.
C. Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations
and/or Floodways: Located within the areas of special flood hazard
(Zone A) established in Section 5:12.1.B, are small streams where no base
flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been identified.
The following provisions apply within such areas:
1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within 100
feet of the stream bank unless certification with supporting
technical data by a registered, professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
2. If Section 5:12.4.C.1 is satisfied and base flood elevation data
is available from other sources, all new construction and
substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of Section 5:12.4and
shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations
established in accordance with Section 5:12.3.E.11.
3. Data from preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies
constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain
Management Technical Bulletin 1-98 Use of Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is pending on the study
in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does
not have to be used.
4. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal,
State, or other source one of the following methods may be used
to determine a BFE. For further information regarding the methods
for determining BFEs listed below refer to FEMAs manual
Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas.
77
a) Contour Interpolation
(1) Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries
onto a topographic map and estimate a BFE.
(2) Add one-half of the contour interval of the
topographic map that is used to the BFE.
b) Data Extrapolation - A BFE can be determined if a site
within 500 feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for
which a 100-year profile has been computed by detailed
methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream
reaches.
c) Hydrologic and Hydraulic Calculations- Perform
hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs
using FEMA approved methods and software. These
methods include, but are not limited to the following:
(1) HEC-RAS 3.1.1 and up
(2) HEC-1 4.0.1 and up
(3) HEC-2 4.6.2
(4) HEC-HMS 1.1 and up
(5) FLO-2D
(6) QUICK-2
(7) SFD
(8) WSPRO
D. Standards for Streams with Established Base Flood Elevations but
without Floodways. Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation
(BFE) data is provided but neither floodway are identified for a Special
Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS. The following provisions
apply within such areas:
1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless
certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one foot at any point within the community.
E. Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones). Located within
the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 5:12.1.B, are
areas designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall
apply within such areas:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet,
above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified,
the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the
78
highest adjacent grade.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall:
a) have the lowest floor elevated to the depth number
specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified,
the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet
above the highest adjacent grade; or,
b) be completely floodproofed together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities to or above that level so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy.
Section 5:12.5 VARIANCE PROCEDURES
A. Establishment of Appeal Board. The Board of Appeals as established
by the City of Greer shall hear and decide requests for variances from the
requirements of this ordinance.
B. Right to Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal
board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Court.
C. Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair of
rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
D. Considerations. In passing upon such applications, the appeal board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
1. the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
2. the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage, and the safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
3. the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
79
owner;
4. the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
5. the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
7. the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development, and the relationship of the proposed use
to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program
for that area;
8. the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site,
9. the costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges and,
E. Findings. Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal
board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance.
Additionally, comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land,
Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator's Office, must be
taken into account and included in the permit file.
F. Floodways. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the
variance. In order to insure the project is built in compliance with the
CLOMR for which the variance is granted the applicant must provide a
bond for 100% of the cost to perform the development.
G. Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this ordinance. The following conditions shall apply to all variances:
1. Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, State, or local laws,
regulations, or ordinances.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
80
3. Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
4. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and
a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a
record of all variance actions.
5. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
6. Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or
other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of
this ordinance. Violations must be corrected in accordance with
section 5:12.43.F.5 of this ordinance.
5:13 PD, Planned Development District
5:13.1 Intent
The PD district is established to encourage innovative and creative design of
residential and/or commercial developments, to permit a greater amount of
flexibility by removing some of the restrictions of conventional zoning. One of the
goals of the Planned Development district is to promote efficient use of land and
protect the natural features and scenic beauty of the land. Ideally, the
development should be large scale and incorporate a variety of land uses or land
use types. The district is also intended to encourage developments that provide
a full range of residential types.
The PD district provides a mechanism for City Council and the Applicant to agree
on the scope of the proposed development. It is recognized that some concepts
will be more appropriate than others and the approval of an application in one
location does not necessarily indicate the development will be applicable in other
locations.
81
5:13.2 Site Size
The minimum site size for any Planned Development is one (1) acres
5:13.3 Minimum Lot Width, Minimum Yard Requirements, Maximum Lot
Coverage, Maximum Height of Structures
No structure shall be erected within 25 feet from any external lot line of any
Planned Development, however, where land uses within a Planned Development
are the same as uses permitted in the adjoining properties outside the PD, a
lesser setback that is consistent with the zoning on the adjoining properties may
be permitted. Minimum lot width, minimum yard sizes, maximum lot coverage,
and maximum height are not otherwise regulated within PD districts provided,
however, that the Planning Commission and City Council shall ascertain that the
characteristics of building location shall be appropriate as related to structures
within the planned development and otherwise fulfill the intent of this Ordinance.

request for variance.
(4) Map or plan showing surveyed distance to the nearest existing
vehicle access points from those proposed.
89
(5) Demonstration through design that the access point is otherwise
optimally located on the lot of record so as to maximize distance
from the nearest access points, provide acceptable turning radii,
and minimize potential adverse impact, including turning
movements and visual impact of strip development resulting from
the less than minimum separation of access points from the
roadway.
5:14.6 UTILITIES

adjacent to street rights-of-way and adjacent to all property lines of conflicting
land uses.
5:14.8-1 PURPOSE
The purposes of buffers are to soften the appearance of development from SC
Highway 101; to screen vehicular use areas; to reduce the impact of conflicting
land uses; and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by
reducing noise and air pollution, light glare, soil erosion, and thermal heating of
the environment.

shall shrubs be more than 30 feet apart in street buffers. The number
of required trees may be reduced and replaced with low-growing plant
material, at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, if it is
determined that the required trees and spacing will adversely interfere
with a designated view shed.
C. Landscape materials may, at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator, be reduced by five percent for each additional five feet
of depth added to the Street Buffer, except that planting of springflowering
trees shall not be reduced less than one tree for each 50 feet
or fraction thereof of street frontage.
5:14.8-3 CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS
A vehicular use area, refuse container, or mechanical equipment, or an office,
commercial or industrial use which is adjacent to a public park facility or land
zoned for residential uses shall have a conflicting land use buffer between this
use and the park or residential land. The conflicting land use buffer shall consist
of:
A. A landscaped buffer strip at least 15 feet wide.
B. One shade tree for each 20 feet or fraction thereof of abutting land. At
least 75 percent of the trees within a conflicting land use buffer shall be
evergreen. Arrangement of trees in clusters or groupings is
encouraged, but in no case shall trees be more than 50 feet apart.
91
C. A hedge, berm, fence or combination thereof forming a continuous
screen at least six feet high.

they are approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way or property
line. Consolidation of vehicular access points and utility lines to the
property is encouraged.
C. Above ground storm drainage, such as drainage swales and water
retention facilities, which maintains the intent of the purpose statement
for buffers.
D. Pedestrian and bicycle paths.
E. Signs in accordance with the regulations of Article 8.
F. Clearing of clear sight distances at the permitted vehicular access
points to a development.

5:14.16 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
Purpose. The compatible relationship of proposed development in the 101
Corridor Overlay Zoning District is of critical public concern for any building or
site improvements. The intent of the design review is to encourage innovative
architecture, and to insure respect for and enhancement of the positive visual,
historical, and cultural experience from SC Highway 101. To accomplish this
purpose, the following guidelines shall apply.
5:14.16-1 Development shall avoid excessive or indiscriminate grading, earth
moving or clearing of property and removal of trees. Grading down to reduce the
height of improvements in designated view sheds is strongly encouraged.
5:14.16-2 Development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious
manner with the terrain and vegetation of the site and surrounding sites.
Structures shall impede, as little as reasonable practical, scenic views of the
natural environment from SC Highway 101.
5:14.16-3 Structures should not dominate, in an incompatible manner, any
general development or adjacent building which is substantially in compliance
with this article. This may be accomplished by the use of proper site design,
architectural features, and/or landscaping to reduce the appearance of excessive
and inappropriate height or mass of proposed structures.
5:14.16-4 The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors
shall be visually harmonious with the overall positive appearance, history and
culture of Greer.
5:14.16-5 Structures shall demonstrate the general principles of good design,
including but not limited to, those dealing with form, mass, scale, height, texture,
and color. Specific consideration shall be given to compatibility with adjacent
structures where such structures are substantially in compliance with this District.
96
A. Buildings located in the Mixed-Use Sub-district shall be designed with
pitched roofs, or the appearance of pitched roofs, with a minimum
slope of 5/12. Wide overhangs are strongly encouraged. Shingles,
metal standing seam, tile or similar roof materials shall be used.
B. Buildings located in the Industrial Sub-district may be designed with flat
or substantially flat roofs. Parapet walls shall be used to disguise roofs
which have a slope less than 5/12. Where practical, the use of pitched
roofs, or the appearance of pitched roofs, is strongly encouraged.
C. Long monotonous façade design including, but not limited to those
characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken
extension of line shall be avoided. This shall be reviewed in relation to
the mass of the building.
D. Stucco, brick, stone, split-faced block, natural wood siding, glass,
stainless steel panels or other materials with similar texture and
appearance shall be used on at least 80 percent of the façade,
excluding doors and windows, facing SC Highway 101 and on the front
25 percent of the length of the side facades visible from SC Highway
101. These materials shall be used on at least 80 percent of all
building sides visible from SC Highway 101 on buildings with a
footprint less than 5000 square feet.
E. The dominant color of structures shall be neutral (e.g. white, shades of
gray or brown) or the natural color of the building material. Non-neutral
colors may be used to accent architectural features of a structure.
Generally, not more than 3 colors per building shall be used.
F. Mechanical equipment, service areas and loading facilities shall not be
visible from SC Highway 101.
5:14.17 SIGNS IN THE 101 CORRIDOR OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT
In addition to the provisions of Article 8, Signs, the following standards shall
apply to signs in the 101 Corridor Overlay Zoning District.
A. The design of freestanding signs shall include at least one color and/or
building material used in the building which the sign represents.
B. Signs on buildings shall be integrated in the design of the building.
5:14.18 ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE
Applicants may request that the Greer Planning and Zoning Board review a plan
which does not meet the specific requirements set forth in this 101 Corridor
97
Overlay Zoning District, but whose design meets the intent of these
requirements. In addition to submitting the required application and plans, the
applicant shall, in writing, explain in detail how the proposal meets the intent of
the stated requirements and why it is better than what would be required under
the specific requirements of this District.
5:14.19 FOLLOWING PROJECT COMPLETION
All appearance features and landscaping required by this zoning district or shown
on the approved application shall be maintained in good condition by the present
owner and all subsequent owners of the property. Changes beyond the owner's
control shall be restored by the owner, unless otherwise provided. Any changes
proposed by the owner shall receive approval by the Zoning Administrator.

Development within the GIBC Zoning District shall provide buffers adjacent to all
street rights-of-way and adjacent to all property lines of conflicting land uses.
5:15.11 PURPOSE OF BUFFERS
The purpose of buffers is to soften the appearance of development within the
industrial park by ensuring adequate green space around each building; to
screen vehicular use areas; to reduce the impact of conflicting land uses; and to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare by reducing noise and air
pollution, light glare, soil erosion, and thermal heating of the environment.
5:15.12 STREET BUFFERS
A. Property located in the industrial sub-district shall provide a street
buffer of not less than 15 feet deep along the roadway. Property
located in the mixed-use sub-district shall provide a street buffer of not
less than 6 feet deep along the roadway. Said buffers shall be
measured perpendicularly from the existing roadway right-of-way line,
or from a new right-of-way line should the application under
consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication or
easement for proposed roadway purposes.
In lieu of the street buffers stated above, all property located in the
GIBC District and fronting on or contiguous to SC Highway 101, or the
Greer South Parkway shall provide a street buffer along the above
named streets of not less than 40 feet deep along the roadway; street
buffers required along other property lines shall be as stated in the

following rate: not less than one canopy or evergreen tree for every 50
feet or fraction thereof of street frontage, and not less than 5 shrubs
per required shade tree. Arrangement of trees and shrubs in clusters
or groupings is encouraged, but in no case shall trees be more than 70
feet apart, nor shall individual shrubs be more than 30 feet apart. The
number of required trees may be reduced and replaced with 30 shrubs
per tree at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, if it is determined
that the required trees and spacing will adversely interfere with a
proposed development design. See Exhibit Three for a graphic
representation of landscaping requirements in the industrial subdistrict.
101
C. Street buffers in the mixed use sub-district shall be landscaped at the
rate of not less than 30 shrubs for ever 50 feet or fraction thereof of

requirements in the mixed use sub-district.
D. Street buffers along Highway 101 or the Greer South Parkway shall be
landscaped at the following rate: not less than one canopy or
evergreen tree for every 50 feet or fraction thereof of street frontage,
and not less than 5 shrubs per required canopy tree, and not less than
one (1) spring flowering tree for every 30 feet or fraction thereof of
street frontage. Arrangement of trees and shrubs in clusters or
groupings is encouraged, but in no case shall trees be more than 70
feet apart, nor shall individual shrubs be more than 30 feet apart. See
Exhibit Five for a graphic representation of landscaping requirements
along Highway 101 or the Greer South Parkway.
E. Landscape materials may, at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator, be reduced by five (5) percent for each additional five
feet of depth added to the street buffer, except the planting of spring
flowering trees shall not be reduced less than one tree for each 50 feet
or fraction thereof of street frontage.
5:15.13 CONFLICTING LAND USE BUFFERS
A vehicular use area, refuse container, mechanical equipment area, loading
dock, service area, outside storage area, or industrial use which is adjacent to a
public park facility or land zoned for or containing existing residential uses shall
have a conflicting land use buffer between this use and the park or residential
land. The conflicting land use buffer shall consist of:
A. A landscape buffer strip at least 15 feet wide.
B. One canopy or evergreen tree for each 50 feet or fraction thereof of
abutting land. At least 75 percent of the trees within a conflicting land
use buffer shall be evergreen. Arrangement of trees in clusters or
groupings is encouraged, but in no case shall trees be more than 70
feet apart.

5:15.22 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
107
Purpose. The compatible relationship of proposed development in the GIBC
District is of critical public concern for any building or site improvements. To
accomplish this purpose, the following guidelines shall apply.
5:15.23 Development shall avoid wherever possible excessive or indiscriminate
grading, earth moving, or clearing of property, and removal of trees. Grading
down to reduce the height of improvements in the designated view sheds shown
on Exhibit Twelve is strongly encouraged.
5:15.24 Development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious
manner with the terrain and vegetation of the site and surrounding sites.
Structures shall impede, as little as reasonable practical, scenic views of the
natural environment.
5:15.25 Structures should not dominate, in an incompatible manner, any general
development of adjacent building which is substantially in compliance with this
article. This may be accomplished by the use of proper site design, architectural
features, and/or landscaping to reduce the appearance of excessive and
inappropriate mass of proposed structures.
5:15.26 The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors
shall be visually harmonious with the overall appearance of the park.
5:15.27 Structures shall demonstrate the general principles of good design,
including but not limited to, those dealing with form, mass, scale, height, texture
and color. Specific consideration shall be given to compatibility with adjacent
structures where such structures are substantially in compliance with this District.
A. Buildings located in the Mixed-Use District are expected to exhibit a
detailed architectural character as appropriate to dense, smaller scale
development. Roofs may be flat or pitched, with roof pitches of less
than 5/12 hidden from view by parapet walls. Particular emphasis
should be given to the creation of well defined entrances; placement of
offices and the use of glass on the front façade of the building is
strongly encouraged.
B. Buildings located in the Industrial Sub-district may be designed with flat
or substantially flat roofs. The front façade of buildings shall, at a
minimum, present a well-defined entry, mixture of materials, sense of
scale and greater detailing than is present throughout the rest of the
building. Articulation of a base and cornice on the front façade is
encouraged.
108
C. Long monotonous façade design including, but not limited to those
characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken
extension of line shall be avoided. This shall be reviewed in relation to
the mass of the building. Larger monolithic materials including concrete
panels should be scored or textured to break their mass, disguise their
scale and add architectural interest. Metal panels may be permitted,
but must be designed and mixed with other materials so as to meet the
intent of this paragraph.
D. In the Industrial Sub-district, pre-cast concrete, tilt-up concrete, stucco,
brick, stone, split-faced block, natural wood siding, glass, stainless
steel panels or other materials with similar texture and appearance
shall be required on at least 80 percent of the front façade, excluding
doors and windows, facing public rights-of-way, and on the front 25

Parking Landscaping
6:9.8 Intent and Purpose of Division
A. The city recognizes that the preservation and maintenance of existing trees and
the planting and growing of new trees and plant material improves the air quality
of the community, improves the appearance of the city and reinforces the civic
pride that both business people and residents of the city share.
B. The city recognizes that patterns of growth, development and urbanization of the
past have resulted in a loss to the citys natural tree cover to detriment to the
microclimate, air quality, appearance and perception of the city.
C. By requiring new development and redevelopment to install and retain, preserve
and/or replace trees and other plant materials, the city has established standards
for growth and development, which will maintain and improve the citys
appearance.
D. It is the intent of this division to provide for the visual and functional separation of
adjacent land uses with plant material and other screening in order to:
(1) Aid in stabilizing the environments ecological balance by contributing to
the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge
and storm water runoff retardation, while aiding in noise, glare and heat
abatement.
(2) Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation.
(3) Provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the city.
(4) Safeguard and enhance property values and protect public and private
investment.

serviceability soil stabilization and plant protection.
B. Bond or other surety. If at the time of a request for a final certificate of
occupancy the required landscaping is not in place and it can be determined
by the city that because of the unavailability of plant material or that the
requiring completion of the landscaping at the time of such request would
jeopardize the health of plant materials or that weather conditions prohibit the
completion of planting, the developer/owner, in order to secure a final
certificate of occupancy, shall provide a bond, letter of credit or other surety in
the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of the proposed landscape
installation, binding for one year and three months from the date of

evergreen screen within three (3) years of installation.
B. Within the buffer yard, fences, walls, earthen berms or any combination
thereof may be used to meet the requirements of this section so long as they are
a minimum of thirty (30) inches in height and provide a continuous opaque visual
screen. Berms shall have a side slope no greater than 2:1.
C. Where existing overhead power utility lines preclude sufficient space for a
shade tree to grow then two (2) small trees shall be substituted for each required
shade tree.

One (1) shrub for every five (5) parking spaces
166
E. Interior planting areas shall be designed within or adjacent to the parking
area(s) as:
Islands, located at the end of parking bays;
Islands, located between parallel rows of cars;
Driveway medians, a minimum of eight (8) feet in width;
Intermediate islands; or
A combination of the above
F. Trees and shrubs must be planted within twenty (20) feet of the parking area
to satisfy the interior planting requirements.
G. The design size and shape of the interior planting areas shall be at the
discretion of the owner; however, no parking space shall be:
Located farther than ninety (90) feet from the trunk of a shade tree;
Separated from a shade tree by a building or other structure.
H. Parking structures are excluded from interior landscape areas.

Existing Trees
It is encouraged to use existing trees to meet the requirements of this section. If
existing trees are preserved to meet the roadside buffer or interior planting
requirements then a reduction in the new planting requirements will be given.
Existing trees will be credited towards meeting the requirements of this section
as follows:
One tree (2 - 6 inches diameter at breast height) = 1 planted trees
One tree (6 - 10 inches diameter at breast height) = 2 planted trees
One tree (10 - 15 inches diameter at breast height) = 3 planted trees
One tree (15> inches diameter at breast height) = 4 planted trees
167
Protection of Existing Trees
Any trees preserved on a development tract to receive credit shall meet the
following protection standards. A root protection zone shall be established
around all trees to be preserved. The root protection zone shall be clearly shown
on all grading and site plans.
A. Root Protection Zone - The land area around the base of a tree in which
disturbances are prohibited in order to protect the roots of the tree and aid the
trees survival. The root protection zone shall be equal to one (1) foot radius
for every inch of tree diameter measured at a point four and one-half (4½)
feet above ground. Root protection zone measurements shall be rounded off
to the nearest foot
B. Protective Barrier - A protective barrier shall be installed at the start of
grading, and be located at the outer edge of the root protection zone.

equipment shall be allowed within the root protection zone and no trespassing
shall be allowed within the boundary of the root protection zone. Utility
easements and borings are permitted.
6:9.12 Landscaping for Preexisting Parking Lots
A. Purpose and intent of section. The city recognizes the need to include minimum
landscaping requirements for preexisting parking lots in this article. The city also
recognizes that failing to bring nonconforming parking lots into conformance with
this article not only jeopardizes the physical revitalization of the city, but also fails
to equally provide the environmental benefits, associated with living trees, to all
regions of the city. The practical effect of this section is to bring these preexisting
areas into conformity with the regulations for the installation of trees and other
plant materials for new development.
B. Preferred design standards. Although not required by this section, the preferred
design of buffers and/or other planting areas for preexisting parking lot areas
would be to install the required minimum number of trees and other plant
materials, spaced evenly, in a buffer between the vehicular surface area and the
public right-of-way. The plant materials used in the buffer yards should be
designed to assure visibility and safety of pedestrians on the public street, as well
as those within the parking lot.
168
C. Application of section. Any preexisting parking lot area to which an expansion or
addition is made shall be landscaped to meet the buffer yard and interior planting
requirements of this section.
D. Landscape requirements.
(1) In order to achieve the desired results of this section, the minimum
number of off-street parking spaces, previously required by the City
Code, may be reduced by a maximum of 25 percent. No reduction in
the required number of parking spaces shall occur without the prior
approval of the zoning administrator, who shall first determine if the
proposed reductions would cause or increase on-street parking
congestion.
(2) Expansions or additions to existing parking lots shall be subject to:
a. Preexisting parking lots that occupy a corner lot, to which any
expansions and/or additions are made and preexisting parking
lots, to which expansions or additions of more than 25 percent
are made, shall meet 100 percent of the buffer yard
landscaping requirements for new development.
b. All other preexisting parking lots, to which expansions or
additions of 25 percent or less are made, shall be subject to
50 percent of the buffer yard landscaping requirements for
new development.
(3) Landscaped planting areas.
a. All preexisting parking lots shall be required to provide and
maintain landscaped planting areas within the interior of,
and/or adjacent to, all portions of the parking lot. Each
landscaped planting area shall contain a minimum area
adequate to accommodate the most growth of the plant
material used.
b. Existing planting areas containing a minimum of 112 square
feet, and existing trees, with a minimum caliper of one inch
measured at a 4 ½ feet above grade, may be used to meet the
requirements provided that should these existing trees
become diseased, unhealthy or die, they shall be replaced
within one year with approved shade trees.
169
c. All areas used for required buffer yards shall be located on the
property. In unusual or extraordinary circumstances as
determined by the zoning administrator, public property or
public-right-of-way may be used to meet the requirements of
this section, provided the property owner obtains permission
from the city public works department and/or SCDOT.
Maintenance remains the responsibility of the private property
owner.
(4) Interior planting areas shall be designed within or adjacent to the
parking area as:
a. Islands, located at the end of parking bays;
b. Islands, located between parallel rows of cars, used to visually
separate parking areas;
c. Part of a continuous street yard planting;
d. Driveway medians, which shall have a minimum width of four
feet for medians with shrubs, six feet for medians with shrubs
and intermediate trees and nine feet for medians with major
deciduous or evergreen trees;
e. Foundation plantings; or
f. A combination of the items set forth in subsection (4) a-e.
(5) Each interior planting area shall contain locally adapted trees and
shrubs at the following rates:
a. Trees shall be required at the minimum rate of one shade tree
for every 4,000 square feet, or portion thereof, of total
preexisting parking lot.
b. Shrubs shall be required at the minimum rate of one shrub per
1,000 square feet, or a portion thereof, of total preexisting
parking lot.
(6) All planting areas shall be protected from vehicle damage by the
installation of curing, wheel stops, extra width in the buffer area or
other method approved by the zoning administrator.
170
(7) Shrubs in buffer yards shall be no less than 18 inches in height when
installed and shall attain a minimum height of 30 inches, as measured
from either the adjacent right-of-way or the paved parking lot,
whichever is higher in elevation. No more than 25 percent of the
required shrubs may be deciduous.
(8) Earthen berms may also be incorporated into the design of any
required planting area. Any berm installed shall have a minimum side
slope of no greater than two to one. Berms shall be planted with
locally adapted species of shrubs, ground covers and/or other plant
materials. However, shrubs planted on berms may have a lesser
height, provided that the combined height of the berm and the
plantings after three years is at least 30 inches high.
6:9.13 Landscaping for Loading, Outdoor Storage and Utility Service
A. In general. All loading, outdoor storage and utility service areas, established
after the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived and not
screened by an intervening building or other screening shall be screened from
view from any public street rights-of-way for their entire length, except for
necessary access. The plant materials used for the screening of these facilities
should be designed to assure visibility and safety of pedestrians on the public
street, as well as those within the parking lot. The required screening in this
section is in addition to any other screening required by this article.
B. Loading areas, including garbage dumpsters and material storage areas.
Screening for loading areas may be accomplished by either:
(1) A solid (opaque) fence or wall which is at least six feet high and is
made of the same or compatible material as the material of the
principal building. Additional plant materials shall be provided so that
no more than two-thirds of the surface area of the fence or wall is
visible from the street within three years of erection of the structure; or
(2) Evergreen plant material which can be expected to reach a minimum
height of six feet within three years of planting. Any plant materials
used to fulfill these requirements shall be a minimum of three feet in
height when planted, and be spaced at intervals that guarantee
complete visual screening within five years.
C. Outdoor storage area. Screening for outdoor storage may be accomplished with
the use of plant material, sold (opaque) fences, walls or earthen berms or any
combination thereof. Screening shall be in accordance with SCDOT sight
triangle requirements and/or those requirements in other sections of this chapter,
to ensure public safety at all drive entrances and exits.
171
(1) Screening shall be exclusive of driveways and sight triangles use for
safe automobile ingress and egress.
(2) When fences and walls are used, they shall be of the same or
compatible material as the material of the principal building. Additional
planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of
the surface area of the fence or wall is visible from the street within
three years of erection of the structure. Twenty-five percent of this
plant material may be deciduous.
(3) Any berms installed shall have a side slope of no greater than two to
one, and shall be planted and covered with live vegetation
(4) All shrubs installed to satisfy the requirements of this section shall be
locally adapted species expected to reach a minimum height of six feet
within three years of planting. All shrubs shall be a minimum height of
six feet within three years of planting. All shrubs shall be a minimum of
18 inches when planted. Vegetation planted on berms may have a
reduced minimum mature height, provided that the combined height of
the berm and the plantings shall be a minimum of six feet in height
after three years. Twenty-five percent of all shrubs may be deciduous.
(5) Screening for utility service areas may be accomplished by locally
adapted evergreen plant materials, fences, walls or a combination
thereof.
(6) Plant materials shall be a minimum of 18 inches in height when planted
and are expected to reach a minimum height of six feet within five
years.
6:9.14 Special Conditions with the Central Business District
properties zoned C-1
A. The city recognizes when a building is removed and is not replaced in
the central business district, creating a gap in the urban form
established by a row of buildings, it is desirable to establish a buffer
yard that screens the vacant property from the adjoining public right-ofway.
Sight triangles must conform to applicable SCDOT or zoning.
172
B. Buffer Yards
1. The minimum average width for any buffer yard shall be four
feet measured at ten-foot intervals along the property lines, and
the minimum width for any buffer yard shall be two feet when
necessary. The buffer yard shall be protected from vehicular
intrusion by the installation of curbing, wheel stops, extra width
in the buffer yard or other method approved by the zoning
administrator. When a wall, fence or similar materials is used in
lieu of landscaping, no buffer yard is required.
2. All areas used for required buffer yards shall be located on the
property. In unusual or extraordinary circumstances as
determined by the zoning administrator, public property or the
public right-of-way may be used to meet the requirements of this
section, provided the property owner obtains permission from
the city public services department and/or SCDOT.
Maintenance remains the responsibility of the private property
owner.
C. The owner may use evergreen plant materials, fences, walls, earthen
berms or any combination thereof to meet the requirements of this
section, so long as all the minimum criteria are met.
D. Evergreen plant materials shall be no less than 18 inches when
installed and shall, within three years, attain a minimum height of 30
inches. Plant materials shall be spaced so as to form a continuous
visual screen within three years.
E. All required screening shall form a continuous visual screen with the
exception of driveways and required sight clearances. However, other
plant materials, maintained at 30 inches or less and/or trees with a
minimum six-foot clearance, shall be allowed provided the installation
meets all state, and/or federal highway sight distance standards.
F. Fences and Walls.
1. Solid (opaque) fences and walls shall be no less than 3 ½ feet
in height when installed and form a continuous visual screen.
2. Fences and walls used to meet the requirements of this section
shall be constructed of:
a. Brick;
b. Textured concrete masonry units;
173
c. Stuccoed block;
d. Treated wood or rot resistant wood, such as cypress or
redwood; or
e. A combination of the items set forth in subsection (2) a-e.
Other materials may be approved upon review by the building and zoning
division.
3. For solid (opaque) walls and fences, planting materials a
minimum of six inches in height (one-gallon size) when installed
shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface
area of the fence or wall is visible from the street within three
years of erection of the structure. Forty percent of this plant
material may be deciduous.
G. All landscape planting areas shall be stabilized with ground covers,
mulches or other approved materials to prevent soil erosion and allow
rainwater infiltration and shall be maintained for the duration of the
premises.
H. Vacant lots created by the removal of a building will be required to
include the planting or preservation of trees within the buffer yard area
between the vacant lot and the public right-of-way.
I. Trees shall be planted in the buffer yard in the following quantities:
1. For any major deciduous tree, one tree per 50 linear feet, or
portion thereof;
2. For any intermediate deciduous tree, one tree per 40 linear feet,
or portion thereof;
3. For any understory deciduous tree, one tree per 20 linear feet,
or portion thereof;
4. For any major evergreen tree, one tree per 40 linear feet, or
portion thereof;
5. For any minor evergreen tree, one tree per 20 linear feet, or
portion thereof;
174
J. In the event of adverse physiographic conditions, or extreme
topographical differences which would, in effect, render the buffer less
than adequate, then the location and quantities of the plant materials
shall be altered to meet the intent of this article.
6:9.15 Exceptions
A. Any lot used for the express purpose of automobile sales and storage is
exempt from the landscaping requirements for interior plantings.
B. Parking Structures (multi-level)
6:9.16 Owner Responsibilities and Maintenance
The owner, his successors, or assigns, are responsible for maintaining all
required plant material in good health. Any planted trees which die or become
unhealthy and used to meet the provisions of this section must be replaced within
one year with vegetation which conforms to the initial planting standards of
section 6:9.11.

6:11.3 Sharing Towers
Applicants proposing communication towers shall first consider sharing existing towers.
The Zoning Administrator, upon proper written proof by the applicant, may grant a
waiver of this requirement if:
(a) The FCC will not permit sharing of a specific tower; or
(b) shared equipment would be incompatible, in that signals from each
would cause interference with the others; or
(c) the owner of a tower will not permit his tower to be shared; or
(d) use of a particular tower will not provide coverage of the proposed
service area.
6:11.4 Landscaping

(a) Around the base of the communication tower, outside of the security
fence, at least one row of evergreen shrubs capable of forming a
continuous hedge at least 6 feet in height shall be provided, with
individual plants spaced not more than 4 feet apart. In addition, at least 1
row of evergreen trees with a minimum caliper of 1-3/4 inches at the time
of planting and spaced not more than 25 feet apart shall be provided
within 50 feet of the perimeter security fence.
(b) The landscaping requirements may be waived in whole or in part by the
Zoning Administrator if it is determined that existing natural vegetation
provides adequate screening or if the Zoning Administrator determines
that the landscaping requirements are not feasible due to physical
constraints or characteristics of the site on which the communication
tower is to be located.
177
(c) All required landscaping shall be installed according to established
planting procedures using good quality plant materials.
(d) A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until the required
landscaping is completed in accordance with the approved Landscape
Plan and verified by an on-site inspection by the Zoning Administrator or
the Zoning Administrators designee, unless such landscaping has been
waived in an accordance with (b), above. A temporary Certificate of
Occupancy may, however, be issued prior to completion of the required
landscaping if the owner or developer provides to the City a form of
surety satisfactory to the City Attorney and in an amount equal to the
remaining plant materials, related materials, and installation costs as
agreed upon by the Zoning Administrator or the Zoning Administrators
designee and the owner or developer.
(e) All required landscaping must be installed and approved by the first
planting season following issuance of the temporary Certificate of
Occupancy or the surety bond will be forfeited to the City of Greer.
(f) The owners and their agents shall be responsible for providing,
protecting, and maintaining all landscaping in healthy and growing
condition, replacing unhealthy or dead plant materials within one year
or by the next planting season, whichever first occurs. Replacement

an existing or proposed runway, or within the horizontal surface associated with such
runway(s) as described in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) Part 77 as amended, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, shall
be lighted. Otherwise, communication towers shall be lighted in accordance with
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular 70/7460-1, Obstruction
Marking and Lighting, as amended from time-to-time. All communication towers shall
be illuminated by strobe lights during daylight and twilight hours and red lights during
nighttime hours.
6:11.6 Signs
A single sign for the purpose of emergency identification shall be permitted. The
permitted sign shall not exceed two square feet in area and shall be attached to the
fence surrounding the tower. Under no circumstance shall any signs for purposes of
commercial advertisement be permitted.
178
6:11.7 Access to Site
Each parcel on which a communication tower is located must have access to a public
road 20 feet in width.
6:11.8 General Requirements
Communication towers, in addition to the requirements set forth above, must also
comply with the following requirements:
(a) A statement shall be submitted from a registered engineer that the
NIER (Non-ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation) emitted therefore does
not result in a ground level exposure at any point outside such facility
which exceeds the lowest applicable exposure standards by an
regulatory agency of the United States Government or the American
National Standards Institute. For roof mounted communication towers,
the statement regarding the NIER shall address spaces which are
capable of being occupied within the structure on which the
communication tower is mounted.
(b) Communication towers and their foundations shall meet the requirements
of the Standard Building Code for wind and seismic loads. Drawings and
calculations shall be prepared and sealed by a South Carolina
Registered Professional Engineer and shall be submitted with the
building permit application.
(c) All communications towers and supporting facilities shall be subject to
periodic reinspection(s) by the Building Codes Department. If any
additions, changes, or modifications are proposed to the site or its
components, proper plans, specifications, and calculations shall be
submitted for permit approval to the Building Codes Department.
Protypical drawings indicating various types of antenna(s) to be located
on the communication tower may be submitted at the time of the
appropriate permit application. Additional antennas may be added to
the communication tower without additional permits or inspections so
long as electrical wiring is not required.
(d) Unless otherwise required by the F.C.C. or the F.A.A., communication
towers shall be light grey in color.
179
(e) Satisfactory evidence shall be submitted, with the building permit
application for a freestanding communication tower, that alternative
towers, buildings, or other structures do not exist within the applicants
tower site search area that are structurally capable of supporting the
intended antenna or meeting the applicants necessary height criteria,
or provide a location free of interference for AM towers.
(f) With the exception of towers constructed for aeronautical purposes,
communication towers may not penetrate any imaginary surface, as
described in FAR Part 77, associated with existing or proposed runways
at a publicly owned airport. Prior to issuance of a building permit,
applicants shall provide documentation that the proposed
communication tower has been reviewed by the FAA, if so required
and that a finding of no hazard to air navigation has been determined.
Copies of the plans shall also be provided for comment to the
Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. If the Airport has an
objection to the proposed tower, an Advisory Conference composed of
Airport officials, City officials and representatives of the communications
company(ies) shall be convened. The results and findings of such
conference shall be presented to the City Zoning Administrator prior
to any permit being issued. Because the proximity of communication
towers near aeronautical facilities affects the safety of the public,
careful consideration should be given to the results and findings and
such may be grounds for the Zoning Administrator denying the issuance
of a permit or requiring that certain additional requirements be imposed
as a condition for the issuance of a permit. Care shall also be taken
in locating communication towers in the vicinity of any private airport
whether or not it is open to the public.
(g) A communication tower must be removed within 120 days of the date
such tower ceases to be used for communication purposes.

Section 6:14 Cluster Development and Open Space
6:14.1 Intent
This section is established to encourage residential subdivision development that
clusters homes to preserve open space for recreational, environmental, and ecological
reasons. The purpose of cluster development is to provide a method of land
development that permits variation in lot sizes without an increase in the overall density
of population or development. This allows the subdivision of land into lots of varying
sizes which will provide home buyers a choice of lot sizes according to their needs,
while at the same time, preserving open space, tree cover, scenic vistas, natural
drainageways, and outstanding natural topography. Such measures prevent soil
erosion and flooding by allowing development to occur according to the nature of the
terrain; provide larger open areas with greater utility for rest and recreation; and
encourage the development of more attractive and economical site design.
The developer, while still building the same number of homes, is able to provide a
more economical product to the consumer by reducing the overall cost of required
sewer, roads, and other infrastructure. Cluster development facilitates the economic
and efficient provision of public services as well. The resultant subdivision benefits fom
the open, recreational space and by the placement of houses in a manner more
conducive to better social interactions among neighbors.
6:14.2 Permitted Density
The overall density of a cluster development may be found in the following table. All
densities are based on the total number of dwelling units divided by the total number of
acres (both developed land and undeveloped open space).

and who proceeds with doing business, does so at his own risk. Such owner or
operator is still responsible in the same way as any other applicant to establish a
need for a change, variance, or use permitted on review. The fact that the
temporary certificate has been issued is not a grounds for establishing a need for
the change, variance, or use permitted on review; nor shall such fact in any way
be deemed to be detrimental reliance by the owner or operator.

Article 10 BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
Section 10:1 Establishment of Board of Zoning Appeals
A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby created with the powers and duties set forth
below.
Section 10:2 Membership
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall be composed of five members. Each
member is appointed for a three-year term provided that the City Council, in the
appointment of the original members of the Board or in filling vacancies caused
by the expiration of the terms of existing members of any such Board, may make
appointments of certain members for less than three years to the end that
thereafter the terms of all members shall not expire at the same time. The City
Council may, at its discretion, appoint not more than two alternate members to
serve on such Board in the absence, for any cause, of any regular members.
Such alternate member or members shall be appointed in the same manner as
regular members and at the regular times for appointment. Each alternate
member, while attending any regular or special meeting of the Board and serving
in the absence of any regular member, shall have and exercise all the powers
and duties of such regular members so absent. The members of the Board shall
have initial terms of office as follows: one member appointed for a term of one
year; two members appointed for terms of two years; and two members
appointed for terms of three years. At completion of the initial term of office for
each member, all additional appointments to vacancies of the Board shall be for
three year terms. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term only. Members
shall be removed for cause by a majority vote of the total membership of the City
Council upon written charges and after public hearing.
Section 10:3 Proceedings
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall draw up and adopt rules governing the
conduct of the affairs which are in keeping with the provisions of this ordinance.
The rules shall provide and require the following in addition to other rules and
regulations the Board shall adopt.
10:3.1 Officials
At the first meeting after its establishment, the Board shall elect a chairman, a
vice-chairman, and such other officers as necessary from among the members.
Such officers shall serve one-year terms and may succeed themselves. The
chairman, or in his absence, the vice-chairman, shall preside at all meetings,
may administer oaths, and compel the attendance or witnesses.
- 257 -
10:3.2 Meetings
Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other
times as the Board may determine. Due notice shall be given to all parties in
interest. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public and all evidence
and testimony shall be presented publicly.
10:3.3 Minutes of Proceedings
The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each
member upon every question or his absence or failure to vote, indicating such
fact, and also keep records of its examinations, findings, determinations, any
other official action. No final action shall be taken unless a majority of the total
membership of the Board is present.
Section 10:4 Appeals and Hearings
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of this ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any
officer, department, board, or bureau of the city. Such appeal shall be taken
within such time as shall be prescribed by the Board of Zoning Appeals by
general rule, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the
Board a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have
been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would,
in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In which case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal, give due
notice of hearing to the parties concerned, and decide the same within a
reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or by
attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from; and shall make
such order, requirement, decision, or determination as in its opinion ought to be
made on the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer

order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in
the enforcement of this ordinance.
10:5.2 Variances
The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon written appeal in specific
cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to
the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship or peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties.
Before action is taken on a request for a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall hold one or more public hearings at which any party may appear in person,
by agent, or by attorney.
One notice of a public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the community at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. The
notice shall list the date, time and place of the hearing, and shall include a brief
description of the application(s) being reviewed. The owner of the property for
which the variance is requested or his agent shall be notified by mail. A variance
from the terms of this ordinance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals
upon finding that:
A. There are special conditions and circumstances which are peculiar to the
land, structure, or building involved which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
B. A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same
district under the terms of this ordinance.
C. The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of
the applicant.
D. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district.
- 259 -
E. The variance requested will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
F. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible
the legal use of the land, building, or structure.
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings
in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE BOARD GRANT A VARIANCE
TO ALLOW A USE NOT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
ORDINANCE IN THE DISTRICT INVOLVED.
10:5.3 Uses Permitted By Special Exception
The Board of Zoning Appeals may hear and decide upon Uses Permitted on
Review specifically authorized by the terms of this ordinance. A use permitted on

B. Notice shall be appearing at least 15 days in advance of a public hearing.
C. A public hearing shall be held.
D. The Board shall make findings.
E. The Board shall make written findings certifying compliance with the

ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map.
In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards shall be a violation of this ordinance and punishable
under Article 14.
- 260 -
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE BOARD GRANT A VARIANCE
TO ALLOW A USE NOT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
ORDINANCE, OR ANY USE EXPRESSLY OR BY IMPLICATION PROHIBITED
BY THE TERMS OF THIS ORDINANCE IN THE DISTRICT INVOLVED.
Section 10:6 Decisions
The concurring vote of four members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
building inspector charged with the enforcement of this ordinance; or to decide in
favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
ordinance; or to grant a variance from the provisions of this ordinance.
Section 10:7 Appeals
Every decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by a
court of record in the manner provided by the laws of the State of South Carolina
and particularly by The South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive
Planning Enabling Act of 1994, S. C. Code Title 6, Chapter 29.
Section 10:8 Fee
A fee of $100.00 shall be paid to the Zoning Administrator for each application for
a variance, use permitted by special exception, interpretation or appeal to cover
the necessary administrative costs.
Section 10:9 Duties of Administrative Official, Board of Zoning Appeals,
City Council, and Courts on Matters of Appeals
It is the intent of this ordinance that all questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall first be presented to the building inspector. Such questions
shall be presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals only on appeal from the
decision of the building inspector and that recourse from the decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be to the circuit Court and the Supreme Court of
the State of South Carolina and particularly by Act Number 487, Acts of 1967. It
is further the intent of this ordinance that the duties of the City Council in

LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
SECTION 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 Intent
The public health, safety, economy, good order, appearance, convenience, morals, and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of land within the City of Greer. In furtherance of this general intent, the regulation of land development in the city is authorized for the following purposes, among others:
1. to encourage the development of an economically sound and stable city;
2. to assure the timely provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new land developments;
3. to assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in and through new land developments;
4. to assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, transportation, and other public purposes; and
5. to assure, in general, the wise and timely development of new areas, and redevelopment of previously developed areas in harmony with the comprehensive plans of the city.
1.2 Definitions
Land Development means the changing of land characteristics through redevelopment, construction, subdivision into parcels, condominium complexes, apartment complexes, commercial parks, shopping centers, industrial parks, mobile home parks, and similar developments for sale, lease, or any combination of owner and rental characteristics.
Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, lease, or building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street or change in existing streets, and includes resubdivision which would involve the further division or relocation of lot lines of any lot or lots within a subdivision previously made and approved or recorded according to law; or, the alteration of any streets or the establishment of any new streets within any subdivision previously made and approved or recorded according to law, and includes combinations of lots of record; however, the following exceptions are included within this definition only for the purpose of requiring that the local planning agency be informed and have a record of the subdivisions:
GP-2
Revision 11-02
a. the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards of the governing authority;
b. the division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved and plats of these exceptions must be received as information by the planning agency which shall indicate that fact on the plats; and
c. the combination or recombination of entire lots of record where no new street or change in existing streets is involved.
1.3 Submission of plan or plat to the Planning Commission or designated staff
The deadline for the submission of any plans or plats to the Planning Commission for review and approval or denial is the fourth Friday of each month. Any plans or plats meeting this deadline, and containing the required elements as set forth in this Ordinance, shall be considered at the next scheduled Planning Commission meeting.
The Planning Commission shall take action on any plans or plats submitted for the next scheduled meeting, unless otherwise agreed upon by both the applicant and the Commission. Failure by the Planning Commission to act upon any plans or plats submitted for review and approval or denial, within sixty (60) days of receipt, shall constitute approval of the plans or plats.

Revision 11-02
GP-4
TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY ANALYSIS
2.1 Purpose
A traffic impact study assesses the effects that a commercial developments projected traffic generation will have on the surrounding transportation network. These studies vary in their range of detail and complexity depending on the type, size and location of the development. These studies are important in assisting public agencies to make land use decisions. They can also be used to help evaluate whether a development is appropriate for a site with respect to traffic impact and what type of transportation improvements may be necessary to accommodate the traffic generated by development.
Traffic impact studies help communities to:
 forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on
accepted practices;
 determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development;
 allocate scarce resources to areas which need improvements;
 reduce the negative impacts of development by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the new development;
 assist decision makers in assessing any zoning change, which is requested in anticipation of the development.
2.2 Definitions
Average Daily Traffic
The average daily traffic (ADT) is the total volume passing a point of segment of a road facility, in both directions, during a 24-hour period. It is commonly obtained during a given time period. Usually it is abbreviated as ADT.
Level of Service
The concept of Level of Service uses qualitative measures that characterize operational conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and passengers. The descriptions of individual levels of service characterize these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.
Six levels of service are defined by the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 for signalized intersections based upon available procedures. They are given letter designations from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of operating conditions. (See Table 1).
Revision 11-02
GP-5
Modal Split
Modal split refers to the distribution of all person trips generated by development among the various transportation modes available, i.e. automobile (drive-alone, shared ride, transit, motorcycle, bicycle, walking).
2.3 Traffic Study Required
The developer shall complete a traffic impact study whenever new construction is expected to generate 100 or more traffic trips during the peak hour or when the redevelopment of an existing project generates 125 or more trips during the peak hour.
Notwithstanding the trip generation threshold, for the purposes of the C-1, Central Business District (CBD) a traffic impact study shall be required on when the anticipated exiting trip exceeds 150 for any one house based on the directions distributional model provided in latest edition of Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers as determined by the City Engineer. The higher threshold for the CBD is established in recognition that the CBD intended under the Citys Future Land Use Plan to be location of greater land use density, having a significant amount of traffic patterns in promoting economic development for the area. Examples of developments generating approximately 150 peak hour trips are shown in Table 2:

GP-6
This trip generation shall be based on trip generation data provided in the latest edition of Trip Generation published by Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) provided; however, the City Engineer may consider trip generation data provided by a licensed, registered engineer.
The study is required when a grading permit application is submitted, or when a preliminary subdivision plat is required, which ever occurs first. A licensed registered engineer must prepare the traffic impact study. The City Engineer or designee shall determine the peak hour to be used in the study and the study area. The City Engineers determination shall be based upon reasonable expectations of time of day usage of like developments in this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions. When developments are expected to have an intensity of usage, which varies from day-to-day, week-to-week, or month-to-month, the determination of peak hour shall relate to days, weeks, or months of maximum utilization. One Hundred- (100) peak hour trips is the ITE, Institute of Transportation Engineers, recommended threshold for triggering a traffic impact study. Examples of developments generating approximately 100 peak hour trips are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Threshold Table for 100 Peak Hour Trips (Total Peak Hour per ITE)

ARTICLE 3 PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Preliminary Procedure and Filing Fees
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall be submitted to the City of Greer Planning Commission according to the Subdivision Activity Calendar available at the Commission office. A mylar reproducible copy of the preliminary plan of the subdivision shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. (See Section 3.2 and Exhibit B) Upon receipt of the proposed subdivision, the applicant will be provided with signs to be posted in prominent places on the subject property. Signs should remain posted until the City of Greer Planning Commission meeting and subsequently removed by the applicant. At the time the developer posts the required subdivision notice signs, the location of the centerlines of any proposed new roads which intersect the existing road will be staked and flagged. After the property has been posted, the subdivision is submitted to the Subdivision Advisory Committee for their review and recommendations. The Advisory Committee is made up of the following representatives as well as others which the Commission may request:
Greenville & Spartanburg County Planning Commission
Charter Communications Commission of Public Works
Greenville & Spartanburg E-911 Blue Ridge Rural Water Co.
Greenville & Spartanburg County School District Bellsouth
City of Greer Engineering Department Duke Power Company
Greenville County DHEC Appropriate Fire District
Emergency Service Representative South Carolina DHEC
South Carolina Department of Transportation
The Advisory Committee will meet at least 10 days prior to the Planning Commission meeting. The developer or his representative will be invited to attend this meeting. Also, any interested citizens may attend this meeting for information about the subdivision. Upon review of the subdivision by the Advisory Committee, a recommendation is made to the Planning Commission. Based on the recommendation of the Subdivision Advisory Committee, and the Planning Commission staff, the Planning Commission approves, denies or amends the proposed subdivision plan.
The Planning Commission shall act on the preliminary plan within 60 days and, if approved, shall indicate in writing the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefore. The action of the Planning Commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the Commission meeting.
On authorization by the Planning Commission, preliminary approval of the subdivision plan shall be noted on the plan and certified by the Director of the Planning Commission or his authorized representative. Also noted shall be the date on which the Planning Commission granted preliminary approval.
Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plan by the Planning Commission, the subdivider
Revision 11-02 4-1
may proceed to comply with the specific requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. Approval of a preliminary subdivision plan shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and dimensions and shapes of lots. The final plat will be considered eligible for approval only after the requirements for final plat approval, as specified herein, have been fulfilled and after all other specific conditions of the Planning Commission have been met.
To help offset the cost to the city of processing a subdivision plat, a filing fee shall be paid with the application for preliminary plat approval. The filing fee shall be calculated as follows. The preliminary plat filing fee shall cover the approval of the final plat. All fees must be paid in full prior to signing the plat for preliminary approval.
Lots 1-19 = $40.00 + $1.50/lot Lots 20-30 = $40.00 + $2.00/lot
Lots 31 or more = $40 + $2.50/lot up to a $300.00 maximum fee. This cost includes out lots and reserve areas for any one subdivision.
All preliminary approvals granted by the Planning Commission shall be valid for a period of time not to exceed one year unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning Commission. If the developer does not apply for and receive an extension, the preliminary approval shall be null and void one year from the initial date of approval.
3.2 Preliminary Plan Requirements
A preliminary plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval in a scale of not less than 1 inch to 50 feet or as specified below and shall include the following (See Exhibit B). Maximum plat size shall be 24"x 36".

ARTICLE 6 PERFORMANCE BOND REQUIREMENTS
6.1 Performance Bonds
The Planning Commission shall have no obligation to allow developers to post bond instead of completed physical improvements; however, it may permit such bonding if it so desires. When bonds are permitted, the developer shall submit to the Planning Commission staff actual cost estimates prepared by the developer's contractors or subcontractors and verified by the City Engineer. These estimates shall cover the full cost of all physical improvements. The bond amount shall be 125 percent of the current cost estimates. A developer may choose either of the following two methods outlined in 6.1-A and 6.1-B to execute said bond:
A. A developer submitting a subdivision plat for final approval whether an individual, partnership, or corporation may execute his own bond if it is accompanied by an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or savings and loan association, cash, a certified check, certificates of deposit, or U. S. government securities properly securing the amount of the bond. If a developer is unable to comply with these requirements, a bond executed by a corporate surety satisfactory to the Commission shall be required (See Exhibit F).
B. All subdivisions will be developed in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by City of Greer Council. In order to proceed with the development and to assure that minimum City specifications will be met, a developer may request the Planning Commission to accept an Assignment to Secure Performance Bond and Completion of
Improvements. This assignment states that "said developer has secured a development loan from a lending institution, and that a specified amount of this loan, as verified by actual cost estimates submitted by contractors, will be held by the issuing institution until all improvements required by the City of Greer Subdivision Regulations are complete and accepted by the appropriate agencies." The amount held in escrow for the required improvements will equal 125 percent of the actual cost estimates (See Exhibit G).
6.2 Initial Bonding Period
All bonds shall be posted with the Commission for and on behalf of the City of Greer. The initial bond will be in effect for one year, subject to conditions as specified by the Planning Commission.
6.3 Constructing Required Improvements Under Bond
After the Commission has approved a final plat and permitted bonding to ensure completion of required improvements, the developer shall complete such improvements. When constructing the required improvements for the subdivision, the following procedures shall apply:
A. Prior to construction, a set of plans will be submitted for review to the City Engineer bearing a certificate by a registered engineer that the plans comply with the city's subdivision design standards.
Revision 11-02 7-2
B. During construction, inspections will be conducted in accordance with Section 10.1-G Inspections.
C. After completing each phase of road and drainage improvements, the developer shall notify the City Engineer that the improvements are ready for inspection. Upon such notification, the City Engineer shall perform inspections of all required improvements. Upon completion of the improvements, "Record Drawings" shall be submitted with certification that the subdivision's design and construction are in compliance with the city's subdivision regulations. Certifications are to be made by a registered professional engineer licensed in South Carolina. (See Reference Item H)
D. After completing all public water improvements, the developer shall notify the Commission of Public Works where applicable, the Environmental Quality Control office of the South Carolina DHEC, and other appropriate district authorities, that the improvements are ready for final inspection.
E. After completing all sewer improvements, the developer's engineer shall certify to the Environmental Quality Control Office of the SCDHEC, Commission of Public Works where applicable, and the appropriate district authority, that the improvements are ready for inspection. The Environmental Quality Control officers of the South Carolina DHEC shall issue a permit to operate for water and sewer before systems are placed into service.
F. In addition to the technical inspections by the appropriate agencies, the Subdivision Administrator for the City of Greer Planning Commission shall make such inspections as necessary to ensure compliance with the Subdivision Regulations and the preliminary plat as submitted.
6.4 Notification to Commission
When the required improvements have been installed and accepted by the proper authority, that agency shall notify the Commission staff by letter. At any time prior to the anticipated completion date, if the improvements are not completed or progressing in accordance with Commission requirements, the proper authority shall notify the Commission and recommend that the bonding company be notified to complete the required work within a specified period of time.
6.5 Commission Action
Following notification to the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall then either release the bond, redeem the bond and call for completion of the required improvements within a specified period of time, or if requested by the subdivider, extend the bond. Prior to granting an extension, the Planning Commission, with recommendation of the City Engineer, shall review
Revision 11-02 8-1
actual cost estimates and work to be completed to ensure that the extended bond is adequate to cover the remaining work. All bond extension request shall be accompanied by a fee of $10.
6.6 Dedications
After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the city or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street; or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street within the subdivision jurisdiction of the City of Greer Planning Commission unless such street has been accepted, opened, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to the attachment of the Planning Commission's subdivision jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Commission. The governing body may locate and construct or may accept any other street if the Ordinance or other measure for such location and construction or for such acceptance is first submitted to the Planning Commission for its approval.
No subdivision shall be granted final (record) approval until the Planning Commission has received a statement duly acknowledged before some officer authorized to take acknowledgment of deeds and signed by each owner of the property to the effect that: (1) the subdivision plan shown on the preliminary plan or a reasonable revision thereof is made with his or their free consent and in accordance with their desires; (2) the dedication of streets or roads shown on the plat and the road dedication form is freely offered; (3) the property shown on the plat is not encumbered by a recorded deed of trust or mortgage or by a judgement rendered by any court. (If the property is encumbered by a recorded deed of trust or mortgage, a duly acknowledged statement containing the consent of the trustee and the holder of the lien shall be submitted. Proof of the satisfaction and discharge of any judgement shall also be shown.) Copies of the dedications required are available from the Planning Commission office (See Exhibits J-1, J-2, J-3)
6.7 Maintenance of Common Areas Within Subdivision Developments
The membership rights and obligations related to the common areas in a subdivision shall be described in covenants running with the land. All common areas shall be properly maintained. Failure on the part of an individual, corporation, firm, partnership, or association to meet all maintenance obligations shall be in violation of this Ordinance and subject to the penalties contained herein.
6.8 Standards for Deed Restrictions or Restrictive Covenants
No deed restrictions or restrictive covenants shall stipulate lower standards than the minimum required herein or within the City of Greer Zoning Ordinance.

Each Point of Tangent will be connected to the point of intersection (PI) with a straight line. There will be no radius placed on property lines at any intersection. The triangles will allow for unobstructed lines of sight. The planting of trees or other plantings or the location of structures exceeding thirty (30) inches in height that would obstruct the clear sight across the area are prohibited. The city has the right to remove any object, material or otherwise, that obstructs the clear sight.
Revision 11-02
11-12
B. Clear Sight Distance
A minimum corner sight distance is required to permit drivers entering the higher-order street to see approaching traffic from a long enough distance to allow the driver to decide when to enter the higher-order street, turn onto the higher-order street, and accelerate in advance of the approaching traffic. The entire area of the clear sight triangle shall be designed to provide the driver of the entering vehicle with an unobstructed view to all points 4.5 feet above the roadway along the centerline from point A to point B. The sight distance in feet is determined by multiplying the posted speed limit by 10. (Advisory speed limits posted such, as those with curve warning signs shall not be used to calculate the required sight distance.)
C. Conformity to the Major Thoroughfare/Transportation Plans - The location and width of all collector and arterial streets and roads shall conform to the official major thoroughfare plan as adopted. Existing streets shall be extended at the same or greater width but in no case, less than the required minimum.
D. Reserve Strips - Reserve strips shall not be permitted (See Section E below).
E. Access to Adjoining Property - The proposed street system shall be designed and improved to provide for desirable access to unsubdivided property adjoining the subdivision.
No subdivision showing reserve strips controlling the access to public ways shall be approved, except where the control and disposal of land comprising such strips are definitely placed within the jurisdiction of and under conditions meeting the approval of the Planning Commission.
Revision 11-02
11-1
F. Alleys - Except in unusual circumstances, no alleys shall be permitted. The Planning Commission may require that provisions be made to provide a secondary means of access for service trucks, etc., in areas of nonresidential uses.
G. Drainage and Utility Easements - The width, length, and location of all easements for drainage and utilities shall be established by the appropriate agency involved and shown on the final plat.
H. Half Streets - New half streets shall be prohibited. Whenever an existing half street is adjacent to a tract of land to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
11.2 Street Names and Street Markers
Proposed street names shall not duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names in Greenville or Spartanburg County. The owner or developer initially shall install all required signage including but not limited to street identification signs, regulatory and warning signs, i.e., speed limit signs, and stop signs. Size, placement, and reflectability shall conform to requirements of the most recent edition of the South Carolina Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. For additional comments see Reference Item A, Sign Specifications.

B. Road Name Changes
The Planning Commission may, after reasonable notice through a newspaper having general circulation in the area in which the commission is created and exists, change the name of a street or road within the boundary of its territorial jurisdiction:
(1) when there is duplication of names or other conditions which tend to confuse the traveling public or the delivery of mail, orders, or messages;
(2) when it is found that a change may simplify marking or giving of directions to persons seeking to locate addresses; or
(3) upon any other good and just reason that may appear to the commission.
On the name being changed, after reasonable opportunity for a public hearing, the Planning Commission shall issue its certificate designating the change, which must be recorded in the office of the Register of Mesne Conveyance or Clerk of Court, and the name changed and certified is the legal name of the street or road.
11.3 Sidewalks
Four-foot-wide sidewalks on one side of the street are required on all residential streets and to extend along any public road frontage as to SCDOT specifications from property line to property line except as follows:
A. In areas where the development density, in terms of gross land area, does not exceed two dwelling units per acre with lots having a minimum of 100 feet of frontage or more.
B. In areas where alternative pedestrian systems are provided. In such cases the elimination of the sidewalk must be approved by the city planning commission after receiving a recommendation from the engineering department. Additionally, the city planning commission shall take into consideration the following basic principles in making a decision to eliminate the required sidewalks:
1. Pedestrian systems must be laid out so that they follow the natural path of circulation.
Revision 11-02
11-1
2. They should be functional rather than formal in design and layout to serve their intended purpose.
3. They should have a reasonable relationship to the foreseeable movement desired, parking and community facilities, and should be safe, secure and attractive.
4. Potential pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular conflicts should be minimized in laying out such a system.
5. Pedestrian circulation system should be selected so as to have minimum practical change in grade (elevation) throughout their lengths.
6. It must be demonstrated that adequate provisions are made to maintain the pedestrian system on an ongoing basis.
7. The pedestrian system surface and design must be consistent with the provisions as set forth in the citys specifications, standard drawings and street design references.
Such sidewalks shall have a minimum width of four (4) feet and shall be located within the public right-of-way and no closer than one (1) foot from the property lines. No mailboxes or other structures may be located within the sidewalk. When mailboxes are placed adjacent to a sidewalk they shall be located in accordance with the specifications shown in the example below.
TYPICAL MAILBOX AND SIDEWALK LOCATION
No Scale
11.4 Access to Community Facilities

All other lots shall conform to the minimum standards as set forth in the R-7.5, Single-Family Residential, zoning classification (City Zoning Ordinance) or DHEC minimum standards. The size, shape and orientation of every lot shall be subject to approval of the Planning Commission with consideration of the type of development and use contemplated.
Flag lots created through the subdivision process, on summary, preliminary, and final plats, must
be determined by the Planning Commission not to be contrary to the public's health, safety and
welfare.
1. The access strip or flag pole shall not be used to calculate the minimum lot area. The front lot setback distance shall be measured from the closest property line parallel to the public road excluding the flag pole.
2. Flag pole lots may not be created deeper than three lots from the existing street without Planning Commission approval.
3. In order to limit the number of encroachments into existing City and SCDOT maintained roads, where multiple flag pole access strips meet the existing roadway, a private access easement must be established for these lots so that only one connection with the existing street is created to serve these lots. The connection with the existing road will meet all applicable City of Greer and/or SCDOT Encroachment Permit requirements and the drive shall be constructed to meet Fire Code Access requirements.
4. Private access easements for flag lots may not serve more than six (6) lots without the authorization of the Planning Commission. The subdivider will be responsible for constructing and installing the driveway.
Revision 11-02

The entrance to subdivisions created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall have an entrance wall where all new subdivision streets intersect with existing roadways. These walls may be constructed of brick, stone, wood or wood like vinyl, finished masonry, landscaped earthen berms or a combination of these materials. The entrance wall or berm should be at least 4 feet in height.
11.7 Subdivision Screening
In subdivisions approved after the effective date of this Ordinance, a landscape screen at least 6 feet in height will be provided along all existing road frontages adjoining the subdivision. The landscaping may be comprised of evergreens at least 6 feet in height, planted 5 feet on center. The required height of the landscape material may be reduced if it is placed on a landscaped earthen berm resulting in a combination of berm and plant material at least 6 feet in height. This landscape screen may also be a combination of fence, berms, landscaping, or other similar materials. The purpose of the berm is to obscure the structures in the subdivision from view from the adjoining roadways.
11.8 Street Lights
All street lights shall be installed in accordance with the standards as set forth by Greer Commission of Public Works and at the expense of the developer. The developer shall be responsible for the operating cost of said lights, until the City of Greer accepts title to the effected subdivisions road infrastructure, at which time the City of Greer will assume responsibility for said operating cost. If the developer elects to install more than the required number of street lights, then the operating costs for all such additional street lights shall be borne by the developer or the residents of the effected subdivision. Streets lights shall be illuminated upon installation for the concerns of safety to the community.

SECTION 4
CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT AND OPEN SPACE
SITE PLAN REVIEW GUIDELINES
4.1 Intent
This section is intended to serve as guidelines for the City of Greer Planning Commission in their review of subdivisions requesting to be considered under the Cluster Development Regulations. The Planning Commission shall determine if the Preliminary Plat(s) is consistent with the purpose and intent of the Cluster Development and Open Space Ordinance and these guidelines:
1. Home sites are clustered to preserve open space for recreational, environmental, or ecological reasons;
2. The development preserves open space, tree cover, scenic vistas, natural drainageways,
and outstanding natural topography, whenever possible; and
3. Within an existing subdivision, the proposed clustered lots should have the least impact on other properties within the same subdivision.
4.2 Preliminary Plats
In addition to the requirements in Article 3 of the Subdivision Regulations section of the City of Greer Land Development Regulations, the following information must be provided at the time of submittal for preliminary approval:
1. Density Table - Located on the Preliminary Plat, should include the number of gross acres, permitted density per acre, required open space (total and breakdown by type), and total number of dwelling units.
Density Table Example
Gross Acres: 40 acres
Permitted Density: 3.6 units/acre
Required open space: 10 acres (25%)
Developable land: 5 acres
Total units: 144 units (40 x 3.6 units/acre)
2. Open space delineation - All property designated for open space shall be delineated on the preliminary plat. A breakdown of open space in flood plain and on steep slopes should be shown on the preliminary plat in total acres and percentages of gross acres. The Planning Commission shall determine the appropriateness of the dimensions of the
Revision 10-19 CL-2
required open space. The open space on the preliminary plat should have meaningful dimensions, proportions, and placement.
3. Areas with standing timber, areas of 30% or greater slope, and other natural features should be shown on the preliminary plat.
4. Required buffer yards should be shown on the preliminary plat, but by no means affects the required amount of open space.
5. Access to open space  all open space shall have a minimum of one primary access point from an internal subdivision road. Additional secondary access points may be included. Access points to the open space shall have the following restrictions:
a. The primary access point shall be twenty (20) feet in width.
b. Additional secondary access point(s) shall be not less than six (6) feet in width.
c. The primary and any secondary access points to the open space shall show as part of the open space and shall not be part of an individual lot nor shall it be an easement.
4.3 Final Plats
In addition to the requirements in Article 5 of the Subdivision Regulations section of the Greenville County Land Development Regulations, the following information must be provided with and noted on the final plat at the time of submittal:
1. Density table, located on the final plat, using the same format as on the preliminary plat;
2. Notations indicating the delineated open space;
3. Conservation easements - Upon the recording of a subdivision, a conservation easement shall be placed on all lands and private waters used to satisfy the open space requirements of a cluster development. The conservation easement shall run with the land, provide for protection in perpetuity, and be granted to the City, a City-approved non-profit land trust, the Home Owners Association or other qualified organization approved by the City. The conservation easement shall be solely for the purpose of ensuring the land remains undeveloped and shall not, in any way, imply the right of public access or any other right or duty not expressly set forth by the terms of the easement. The conservation easement should include a complete metes and bounds of the property being designated as open space;
4. Subdivision covenants - The covenants for the subdivision shall include provisions for the protection of trees and other natural amenities within the property designated for open space. The removal of trees and natural vegetation is permitted in the development phases for the purpose of utility easements, passive recreational uses and drainageways with the proper notations on the final plat. Neither the developer, property owners, or other subsequent contractors or builders shall be granted permission to remove or destroy
any trees or natural vegetation from the open space area for passive recreational or any other purposes without the express written permission of the community board, or
Revision 10-19 CL-3
homeowners association, or property owners, or trustees having jurisdiction over the implementation and enforcement of the subdivision covenants. Normal maintenance and the removal of dead or fallen trees are permitted and recommended.
5. Access to open space shall be shown on the Final Plat in conjunction with the requirements of Section 4.2-5.
4.4 Buffers and Screening
Within the required 25' buffer yard any existing trees should be preserved and protected by appropriate easements on the plat and in the property deeds. The buffer yard by no means affects the required amount of open space. If the buffer does not have standing timber, adjacent developments shall be screened according to the following specifications:
For every 100 linear feet of the buffer yard, as a minimum, there shall be planted:
 3 - minimum 2" caliper canopy trees; and
 4 - minimum 6' evergreen trees; and
 9 - minimum 2' deciduous and evergreen shrubs
The applicant may propose, for Planning Commission approval, a comparable list of plant materials for creating a natural visual buffer.
4.5 Existing subdivisions
Cluster development is permitted in previously platted subdivisions if:
1. A phase of an existing subdivision has received preliminary approval, but site preparation work, including grading, has not begun; and
2. A phase of a subdivision is not completely developed and 100% of all the property owners in that phase agree to the cluster design on the remaining property.
4.6 Variances
Variances may be granted to road and cul-de-sac designs or any other required element of a subdivision, whenever, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the strict application of the requirements contained in these regulations would result in substantial or excessive difficulties, hardships, or injustices. The Planning Commission may modify such requirements so that the subdivider is allowed to develop his property in a reasonable manner. The public interests of the city and its citizens are to be protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations will be preserved. All affected city departments shall accept variances granted by the Planning Commission. Variances approved by the Planning Commission shall be binding for all affected city departments.
