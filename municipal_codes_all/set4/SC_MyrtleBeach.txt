PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through February 12, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Thomas Leath, City Manager, Mr. Joseph Wettlin, Assistant City Manager, and Ms. Mandy Tomz, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-6. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code.

(a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code, which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, sections or subsections or any part thereof by a subsequent ordinance, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances, as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of the subsequent ordinances until the time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the council. 
(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending the provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is hereby amended to read as follows: ...." The new provisions shall then be set out in full. 
(c)  In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language shall be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is hereby amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) which reads as follows: ...."

Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, when necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter", "this article", "this division", etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-9. - General penalty; continuing violations; abatement of prohibited conditions. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance or resolution of the city council or in any rule, regulation or order promulgated by any officer or agency of the city under authority duly vested in him or if any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or the doing of any act is required, or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or order shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days, or both, in the discretion of the judge of the municipal court. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any such ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or order shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Any person who violates any provision of the Code may be issued a warning, citation or notice that the person is in violation of the Code, or notification that certain action is necessary to comply with the Code, in lieu of or in addition to any other penalties provided for a violation of this Code. Any warning, citation or notice shall state the bond set by the city court for the violation. The procedures governing the issuance, form and content of warnings, citations and notices of ordinance violations shall be prescribed by the city manager. 
(c)  An ordinance summons is hereby adopted which may be used to issue citations for all violations of municipal ordinances except for violations of a municipal ordinance which regulates the use of motor vehicles on public roads. The ordinance summons is adopted pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code 1976, § 56-7-80, and shall be in the form prescribed in that statute. Procedures for use of the ordinance summons shall be as required by S.C. Code 1976, § 56-7-80, and as may be further established from time to time by the city manager. 
(d)  In addition to the penalties hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or order shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that the condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
(e)  The penalties and punishments referred to above are the penalties and punishments for the violation of all provisions contained in this Code and for the violation of all amended ordinances or any new ordinances which may be legally enacted by the city council, unless otherwise specifically provided.

Sec. 1-10. - Certain ordinances, rights, etc., not affected by Code. 
(a)  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect any ordinance: 
(1)  Promising or guaranteeing the payment of money for the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or any contract or obligations assumed by the city;

and all such ordinances are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this Code. Such ordinances are on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect any offense or act committed or done, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this Code.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Council meetings, S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-250.

(Code 1980, § 1-3-2; Ord. No. 98-26, 5-26-98) 
Sec. 2-43. - Quorum and rules of order. 
(a)  Quorum. A majority of the council members serving shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at any meeting. 
(b)  Rules of procedure. 
(1)  Authority. S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-250 provides that: "The council shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall provide for keeping minutes of its proceedings which shall be a public record." 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of city council in adopting rules of order is to enable council to transact business with speed and efficiency while protecting the rights of all persons whether in the majority or the minority. Arbitrary technical rules must not prevent the council from accomplishing the public's business. Therefore, it is the intent of council that common sense and courtesy be applied when enforcing the rules of procedure so that the will of the majority of council may be achieved while insuring that all positions are heard and considered. 
(3)  Presiding officer. Normally the mayor or, in the mayor's absence, the mayor pro tempore, shall preside at any meeting as provided in section 2-22. Notwithstanding that provision in section 2-22, however, city council may, upon motion passed by a two-thirds majority of all council members serving, elect a council chairperson and vice-chairperson who shall then serve as presiding officer at all future meetings until the next general or special election at which any member of council, including the mayor, is elected and takes office. In the event that the mayor or mayor pro tempore (or chairperson or vice-chairperson) is not in attendance or is ineligible to preside at any meeting, the members present shall elect a member to preside. 
(4)  Order of business. The standard order of business, which shall be reflected in the meeting agenda, shall be as follows: 
a.  Call to order. 
b.  Invocation. 
c.  Pledge of allegiance. 
d.  Approval or correction of agenda. [3] 
d.1.  Consent action. 
e.  Approval or correction of minutes. 
f.  Public requests, presentation of petitions, awards, memorials. 
g.  Reserved. 
h.  Workshop. 
i.  Second reading and adoption of ordinances. 
j.  First reading and advertisement of ordinances. 
k.  Resolutions. 
l.  Motions. 
m.  Nonagenda items from the public (each speaker limited to three minutes). 
n.  Communications from city council and city manager. 
o.  Reports and information presentations from city staff. 
p.  Executive session. [4] 
q.  Adjournment. 
(5)  Procedure pursuant to the agenda. 
a.  Information and presentation items. Many items on a meeting agenda do not involve a decision making or legislative action on the part of council. These include the invocation, presentations, awards, and nonagenda items from the public. When these items are reached on the agenda, the presiding officer should simply announce them and introduce the individual or group who will be making the presentation or providing the information. If a discussion involving the presenters and council members is appropriate, the presiding officer should control the discussion to maintain proper decorum and to insure that the discussion remains relevant to the agenda topic. When it becomes apparent that the subject has been thoroughly covered or the discussion has become redundant or strayed from the topic, the presiding officer should, with the consensus of the council, end the discussion and announce the next agenda item. 
b.  Legislative items. Council takes action by resolution or ordinance. Ordinances must be in writing and in the form required for final adoption when introduced. Resolutions are most commonly introduced in writing but may be introduced and approved in oral form. Upon reaching an ordinance or resolution on the agenda, the presiding officer will read the ordinance or resolution by title (or the presiding officer may ask the city clerk to read it) and ask the city manager to present a brief explanation of the ordinance to include its expected effect and who has proposed it. The manager may ask a staff member or a retained expert to give this briefing. 
After the manager's briefing, the presiding officer will call for a motion from council. If no motion is made, or if the motion is not seconded, the presiding officer will move on to the next agenda item. If a motion is made and seconded, the presiding officer will call for discussion in the following order: 
1.  The council member who made the motion. 
2.  Other members of council. If the presiding officer perceives that an item is to be contested, he or she will, if possible, call alternately on a proponent and an opponent. All council members, however, should be given an opportunity to speak on an issue before any member is permitted to speak for a second time. With the consensus of council a council member may ask a question of, or seek information from, the city manager, a staff member, or a member of the public. These individuals may respond to the specific question or request, but should not otherwise be permitted to speak during council's discussion. 
3.  The public [5] Unless council decides otherwise by consensus or majority vote, public input on each legislative item will be limited to no more than thirty minutes. The presiding officer will attempt to alternate between proponents and opponents when recognizing individuals to address council. Each speaker will be limited to three minutes. 
4.  Further discussion from council. At the conclusion of public input, council members may be given an opportunity for further discussion in the order provided in subsections 1. and 2., above. 
After the discussion is completed, the presiding officer shall, if the motion has not been disposed of or postponed by subsidiary motion, immediately restate the motion before council and call for the vote of council pursuant to the requirements contained in section 2-44. Following the vote, the presiding officer should immediately announce the results. 
c.  Nonagenda items. Nonagenda items from the public or staff will be accepted only for the information of council. 
(6)  Motions. A motion is the means by which city council takes any legislative action. Motions are ranked in order of precedence: a motion may be made only if no motion of equal or higher precedence is on the floor. The precedence of each motion is indicated in brackets after its title. All motions must be seconded, and are adopted by majority vote unless otherwise noted. All motions may be debated unless otherwise noted. These motions [indicated by an asterisk] may be made at any time that they are relevant to the issue presently on the floor or the decision which has just been made: 
a.  Motion to adjourn [1]. Not debatable; goes to immediate majority vote. 
b.  Call for the orders of the day [1]. Directs the presiding officer to return to the approved agenda. Not debatable. 
c.  Call the question [1]. Not debatable. Closes debate on the motion on the floor and forces a vote on that motion. Requires a 2/3 -majority vote. 
d.  Motion to limit or extend limits of debate [2]. Not debatable, can be amended, requires a 2/3 majority vote. 
e.  Motion to refer [2]. Should specify which committee, board, or commission the matter is to be referred to, what council expects the group to do, and when it should be reported back to council. Approval of this motion ends discussion of the matter and the presiding officer should proceed to the next agenda item. 
f.  Motion to continue [3]. May be made instead of a main motion when an agenda item comes before the Council or at any time before the main motion is disposed of. Should specify when the matter is to be brought back before council and what action or information is desired before it is brought back. If approved it ends consideration of the agenda item for the current meeting and the presiding officer should move to the next item. 
g.  Motion to amend [3]. 
h.  Main motion [4]. 
i.  Motion to appeal decision of the presiding officer.* Not debatable. Requires immediate vote. Always stated by presiding officer so that a yes vote sustains his or her decision. Presiding officer retains the chair, but must proceed as voted by the majority. 
j.  Object to the consideration of a question.* Once agenda is approved, requires 2/3 -majority vote. Not debatable. 
k.  Point of order.* This is a request from a member for action by the presiding officer and may be made even when someone else has been recognized to speak. No second is required; no amendment is permitted; and no vote is required unless the presiding officer asks council to decide the issue or the decision of the presiding officer is appealed. The point of order is frequently used to question a procedure undertaken by the presiding officer or to suggest an alternate procedure to the presiding officer. 
l.  Motion to reconsider.* May only be made before adjournment of the meeting at which the original action was taken. Must be made by a council member who voted on the winning side on the original action. Nothing herein should be construed to prevent the original matter from being placed on the agenda for a subsequent meeting if requested by at least three council members. After 90 days, the original matter may be added to a meeting agenda using the same procedure as with any other matter not previously decided by council. 
m.  Motion to suspend the rules.* Can be made at any time that no question is pending. If a matter is before council and the motion to suspend is applicable to that matter, the motion to suspend takes precedence over all other motions. It is not debatable or amendable and requires a 2/3 -majority to pass. This motion permits council to do something it wishes to do but cannot without violating one or more of the rules contained in its rules of procedure. This motion cannot be used to modify or suspend any requirement of state law. 
(7)  Public hearings. A public hearing is a special type of meeting. It is intended to provide council the opportunity to gather information from public input and provide information to the public. State law requires that a public hearing be conducted under certain circumstances. The presiding officer should call the hearing to order and announce the purpose of the hearing. The presiding officer should recognize individuals who wish to address council and should ensure that representatives of all competing views have a fair opportunity to express those views. The council can take no action during the public hearing. 
A public hearing may be a separate meeting or may be held during a regular council meeting. If it is during a regular council meeting it generally occurs at the point on the agenda where the subject of the public hearing is listed for action. In that case the presiding officer must clearly announce the start of the hearing and the adjournment of the hearing so that it is clear when the special rules applicable to the hearing apply and when the rules of procedure for regular council business are restored. A record of each public hearing must be kept and should include: 
a.  A hearing agenda. 
b.  A record of all the members of the public who participate. 
c.  Proof of any required notice or publication. 
d.  Minutes or a tape of the proceedings. 
e.  Copies of any materials received from the public or distributed to the public. 
(8)  Disruptive conduct. These rules of procedure are adopted based on the expectation that all persons attending a meeting of city council will be honorable and will conduct themselves with courtesy for all other individuals present. In most situations where an individual's conduct becomes disruptive, it will be inadvertent and a warning from the presiding officer will be sufficient to correct the offensive behavior. If that is not the case, or if the presiding officer is determined by council to be disrupting or obstructing the proceedings of a council meeting, the following shall apply. 
a.  It is unlawful for any person to disrupt a meeting of city council. If a person who is determined by the presiding officer, or by a majority vote of council, to be disruptive, refuses to discontinue the disruptive behavior, the matter will be immediately reported to the police department who will, upon responding, take necessary action to end the disruption. Action by the police may include, if necessary, removing the offending individual from the meeting room. 
b.  In a case where the disruptive person is a member of council, a determination that the disruptive behavior is in violation of these rules shall be made by a majority vote of council. 
c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2-22, if the presiding officer refuses to call for action on a matter on an approved agenda, ignores a motion apparently made and seconded in good faith, refuses to allow council to vote on an appeal from a decision or ruling of the presiding officer, or in any other way refuses to conduct the meeting in accordance with these rules, council may by majority vote declare the chair vacated. Any council member may move to vacate the chair based on the refusal of the presiding officer and, upon receiving a second, the member who made the motion may call for the immediate vote of council. If the motion receives a majority vote the position of presiding officer shall be filled for the remainder of the meeting as provided in subsection (b)(3), above, as if the presiding officer were absent. Unless the original presiding officer is removed from the meeting as provided in subsection (b)(8)a., above, he or she shall be permitted to remain in the meeting and participate as any other council member. 
(9)  Items not covered. Any matter or order of procedure not covered by these rules shall be referred to the presiding officer who shall decide the matter in conformity with the purpose of these rules. The decision of the presiding officer may be reversed on appeal by a majority vote of council. 
** These motions may be made at any time that they are relevant to the issue presently on the floor or the decision which has just been made.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Note- The South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires that an agenda be advertised 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time. It has been argued by some parties that this prevents the amendment of the agenda after the advertisement. The better argument seems to be that when it is necessary in the public interest to add a matter to the agenda after it is published, council may do so. 

--- (4) --- 
Note- When related to the item being considered, an executive session may be held at the time a matter is being discussed if a majority of council votes to do so. 

--- (5) --- 
Note- There is no state law requirement that public input be accepted during the consideration of a resolution or ordinance. With limited exceptions, there is no state law requirement for a public hearing on a resolution or ordinance. It has long been the practice in Myrtle Beach, however, to accept public input during council deliberations on most, if not all, matters that come before council. This provision preserves the practice while establishing some rules for that input.

(a)  All actions of council shall be by majority vote of members present at a public meeting unless a different majority is required by state law or by ordinance. 
(b)  Every member of council present at the meeting (including the mayor or presiding officer) shall vote on every question except when required to refrain from voting by state law. If a member declines to vote, and is not required to refrain by state law, the minutes will reflect that the member voted in the affirmative. 
(c)  The vote on every question shall be by a show of hands when the vote is not unanimous, and shall be recorded in the council minutes by the city clerk.

Sec. 2-45. - Minutes of meetings. 
    The city clerk shall keep the minutes of all public meetings of council which shall be a matter of permanent public record. At each council meeting the minutes of the previous meeting shall be presented for approval. Minutes shall not be considered the official record of a meeting until approved by council. Any member of council desiring to express a position on a matter voted upon by council in the minutes may do so by presenting the position in writing to council not later than the next regular meeting. 
(Code 1980, § 1-3-5) 
Sec. 2-46. - Appearance of citizens.

(Code 1980, § 1-3-6) 
Sec. 2-47. - Agenda. 
    All requests or matters for official action of the city council shall be submitted to the city clerk by Wednesday preceding the regular council meetings. The agenda shall then be prepared and mailed or placed in the hands of the members of the city council. Nothing shall be brought up in meetings of the city council which is not on the official agenda, except by councilmembers or the city manager. 
(Code 1980, § 1-3-7) 
Sec. 2-48. - City attorney to attend.

(Code 1980, § 1-3-8) 
Sec. 2-49. - City clerk is ex officio clerk of council.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-81. - Employment. 
(a)  General policies; administrative and operation handbook presented for council review. Under the council-manager form of government, the city manager administrates the policies set forth by the legislative body. South Carolina Code § 5-14-40 prohibits the legislative body dealing with employees or interfering with the operation of municipal departments, offices or agencies under the manager's direction. In section 2-107, the legislative body recognizes the full power of the manager to appoint and remove any officer or employee within his discretion. For the purpose of establishing general operational and administrative policies, procedures and regulations regarding employment, the manager may, from time to time within his discretion, promulgate a handbook for employees and may present the handbook for council's review. If promulgated, the handbook shall reflect the overall legislative policies set forth herein. Because the administrative and operational control of the employment force is solely within the authority of the manager under our form of government, the handbook shall not be adopted by ordinance or resolution, but may be reviewed by the legislative body upon presentment by the manager. 
(b)  Policy of "at will" employment; contracts must be in writing endorsed by the manager. The city has a policy that all employment status is "at will", with the exception of judges under the unified court system. "At will" employment recognizes the right of the employee to resign at any time without providing a reason or explanation to the organization. "At-will" employment also recognizes the right of the city to terminate employment at any time without providing a reason or explanation to the employee. At will employment is terminable by either party at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. Nothing in the manager's personnel handbook can change the at-will status of employment as set forth herein, or create an expectation of a contract or continued employment on the part of any employee. No one other than the city manager may make any promise or assurance or enter into any contract, whether oral or written, express or implied, that is any way inconsistent with the policy set forth herein. Any promise, assurance or purported contract or agreement shall be invalid and not binding upon the city unless adopted, endorsed or agreed to in writing by the city manager. 
(c)  Policy to remain in force. The city manager may make such rules, regulations and changes to the handbook as are necessary for the effective administration of the human resource system. Employment, promotions, demotions, discipline and training are solely within the scope of the manager's responsibilities. The city manager may also make exceptions to or waive the procedures included in the handbook as needed to achieve organizational goals, excepting, however, that the general legislative policies expressed herein shall in no way be impacted.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-41, pt. 1, adopted July 24, 2018, repealed the former Div. 2, §§ 2-241-2-255, and enacted a new division as set out herein. The former Div. 2 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1980, §§ 1-5-33-1-5-46; Ord. No. 95-12, adopted Feb. 28, 1995; Ord. No. 2007-35, adopted June 12, 2007; and Ord. No. 2011-55, adopted Oct. 11, 2011. 

Sec. 2-241. - Purchasing agent; specified duties. 
    The city manager, or an officer of the city designated by the city manager, shall be the purchasing agent for the city. He shall be responsible for: 
(1)  The purchase of supplies, materials and equipment and contractual services required by any office, department or agency of the city government. 
(2)  Ensuring that vendors or contractors working on city property have appropriate insurance and business licenses, as required by the city. 
(3)  The storage and distribution of all supplies, materials and equipment required by any office, department or agency of the city government. 
(4)  Establishing written specifications, whenever practicable, for supplies, materials and equipment required by any office, department or agency of the city government. Such specifications shall be definite and certain and shall permit competition. 
(5)  Maintaining, whenever practicable, a perpetual inventory record of all materials, supplies or equipment stored in store rooms or warehouses. 
(6)  Soliciting and maintaining an up-to-date list of qualified suppliers who have requested their names to be added to a "bidders list." The purchasing agent shall have authority to remove temporarily the names of vendors who have defaulted on their quotations, attempted to defraud the city or who have failed to meet established specifications or delivery dates. 
(7)  Obtaining as full and open competition as possible on all purchases, contracts and sales. 
(Ord. No. 2018-41, pt. 2, 7-24-18) 
Sec. 2-242. - Competitive processes required; small purchase waiver. 
(a)  Before any purchases or contracts for supplies, materials, equipment or services are made, the purchasing agent shall give ample opportunity for competitive bids or proposals. If any of the low bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder. If two or more of such bids are submitted by local bidders, the purchasing agent shall award the contract to one of the local tie bidders by drawing lots in public. If local bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the purchasing agent shall award the contract to one of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public. 
(b)  No contract or purchase shall be subdivided with the effect of avoiding the requirements of this section. 
(c)  However, in the event of an emergency affecting the public welfare, health or safety, neither the provisions of this section nor those of section 2-243 shall apply. An "emergency" is a sudden, unexpected, or impending situation that may cause injury, loss of life, damage to property, and/or interference with normal activities and which, therefore, requires immediate attention and remedial action. The purchasing agent shall file a full report of the circumstances of an emergency purchase to be kept on file for a period of seven years. 
(d)  Section 2-242(a) above notwithstanding, for purchases not exceeding $2,500.00 ("small purchases") only, upon making a judgment that prices are reasonable, the purchasing agent or a department director acting as purchasing agent under the provisions of section 2-243(c) may waive the requirement for competitive bidding, provided as follows. 
(1)  When practical, the purchaser must solicit a quote from other than the previous supplier before placing a repeat order. 
(2)  When the small purchase waiver is used, the purchaser shall annotate the purchase requisition "price is fair and reasonable," and sign. 
(3)  The department director's signature authorizing the small purchase shall be certification of his or her judgment that the purchaser has complied with this section and of the sufficiency of appropriated and available funds for the items or services to be purchased. 
(4)  Action to verify the reasonableness of the prices of small purchases need be taken only when the department director authorizing the purchase suspects that the price may not be reasonable in comparison to previous prices paid or based upon personal knowledge of the item involved. If, in the judgment of the appropriate department director, the cost of verifying reasonableness exceeds the potential difference in pricing, this requirement may be waived. 
(5)  Periodically, the financial services department staff may review samples of small purchases and, if they believe that prices may not have been reasonable in comparison to prices paid for similar or identical items or based upon their personal knowledge of the item involved, they shall advise the department director in order to improve results with respect to future purchases of identical or similar items. Nothing in this subsection 2-242(d) shall affect the purchaser's or the purchasing agent's responsibility to comply with the remaining requirements of article VI, division 2 of this Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2018-41, pt. 2, 7-24-18; Ord. No. 2019-21, 3-12-19) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2019-21, adopted March 12, 2019, amended the title of § 2-242 to read as herein set out. Former § 2-242 was titled, "Competitive processes required." 
Sec. 2-243. - Requirements for written vs. oral procedures to ensure competition. 
(a)  Written procedures required for certain purchases and sales. 
(1)  All supplies, equipment, and contractual services, except as otherwise provided herein, when the estimated cost thereof shall exceed $25,000.00 shall be purchased by formal, written contract from the lowest responsible bidder or proponent, after due notice inviting bids or proposals. 
(2)  All sales of personal property that has become obsolete or unusable, when the estimated value shall exceed $5,000.00, shall be sold by formal written contract or at a public auction to the highest responsible bidder, after due notice inviting proposals or bids. 
(b)  Oral procedures permitted for purchases in amounts not exceeding $25,000. All supplies, equipment, and contractual services, except as otherwise provided herein, when the estimated cost thereof shall not exceed $25,000.00, may be purchased on the basis of requests for oral quotes from no fewer than three vendors. 
(c)  Limited purchase orders ("LPO"). A limited purchase order (an "LPO") is a mechanism by which departments of city government may purchase supplies, equipment, and contractual services of a value not exceeding $7,500. The purchasing agent may allow directors of city departments to authorize purchases to be made by LPO, in which case the director of the appropriate department shall act in the capacity of the purchasing agent and, in so acting, shall be responsible for all duties ascribed to the purchasing agent by this code. Limited purchase orders may not be used in order to contravene the section 2-242 objectives of observing competitive processes or of prohibitions against subdividing a purchase. The use of an LPO for the purpose of making an emergency purchase shall not relieve the user of the responsibility to document and retain documentation regarding the emergency purchase per the provisions of section 2-242(c). 
(Ord. No. 2018-41, pt. 2, 7-24-18) 
Sec. 2-244. - Award to lowest bidder; advertising, when required.

The notice required herein shall include a general description of the articles or services to be purchased or sold, shall state where the necessary bid or proposal documents and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening responses. For purchasing conducted under section 2-243(a)(1), the notice shall include, at minimum, publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(b)  When selling city property under section 2-243(a)(2), nothing in this section shall prevent the purchasing agent's contracting with outside agents for the purpose of serving public notice, listing items to be sold, conducting auctions and providing other services to the city as a listing and sales agent. 
(Ord. No. 2018-41, pt. 2, 7-24-18) 
Sec. 2-245. - Bid deposits. 
    When deemed necessary by the purchasing agent, bid deposits shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. Upon entering into a contract, bidders shall be entitled to return of bid deposit where the purchasing agent has required such. A successful bidder shall forfeit any bid deposit required by the purchasing agent upon failure on his part to enter into a contract within ten days after the award; provided, however, that the city, in its uncontrolled discretion, may waive this forfeiture.

5.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services; 
6.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;

The cost of providing the special or enhanced services required or made necessary by the tourism industry should be apportioned more equitably between the resident taxpayers and those who visit our city and enjoy the programs, events, benefits and municipal services, however briefly.

(Ord. No. 2013-51, § 2, 8-13-13)

Persons who choose to remain shall remain within the boundaries or premises of their domiciles or business during the time of evacuation or emergency. It shall be unlawful to interfere with evacuation orders by conduct outside the boundaries of a person's domicile or place of business. 
(b)  Custodial arrest and forcible removal could divert law enforcement resources to the detriment of the greater good in administering warnings to the general public, establishing evacuation checkpoints, and other emergency plan implementations. Should persons disobey a mandatory evacuation order duly authorized and issued by the authorities, they remain in the life threatening area at their own personal risk and peril, and at the risk and peril for those persons over whom they exercise custody or command, and do so with the full knowledge that law enforcement and emergency medical response may not be available for response during the state of emergency due to conditions or circumstances of the event or the performance of other duties.

Sec. 8-23. - Enforcement and remedies of regarding executive orders.

Any person who violates any provision in this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be punishable by a fine not exceeding $500.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days, or both such fine and imprisonment, for each violation. Each person assisting in the commission of a violation, shall be guilty of separate offenses. Each day during which a violation or failure to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
(c)  In addition to the remedies prescribed in this section, the manager is authorized to obtain an injunction to restrain violation of laws, code sections, orders, rules and regulations which are contained in the state law or this code, and/or which are implemented by the local governing authority during a declared emergency. 
    These emergency powers shall become effective only upon the signing of a declaration of emergency by the governing authority, stating that Chapter 8 emergency powers are in effect. Unless otherwise specified in the declaration of emergency or otherwise extended by the city governing authority, the provisions of this Code section shall remain in effect during the state of emergency and for a subsequent recovery period not greater than 30 days, unless extended by act of city council.

DIVISION 4. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 10-60. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council of the City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the expeditious removal of graffiti from public and private property. 
    The council finds that mere existence of graffiti is a public nuisance, and its appearance is immediately destructive of the rights and values of property owners, creates a sense of disorder and unease among visitors and citizens, and in some cases, marks the beginning of an effort to establish territorial boundaries for those who would harm the entire community. While innocuous graffiti poses an aesthetic public nuisance, gang-related graffiti presents a public safety concern that merits expeditious response to preserve the public health, safety and welfare. Unless the property owner or the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain, and then proliferate. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the citizens and tourists. 
    The city council intends, through the adoption of this article, to provide an immediate and effective procedure for the expeditious removal of all graffiti, in order to preserve public safety, health and welfare.

    Responsible party means an owner, legal occupant or an entity or person acting as an agent for an owner by agreement, which has authority over the real property or is responsible for the property's maintenance or management. Irrespective of any arrangement to the contrary with any other party, each property owner shall always be a responsible party for the purposes of this section. There may be more than one responsible party for a particular property. 
(Ord. No. 2014-75, 9-23-14)

Whenever the city becomes aware of the existence of graffiti on any property, the city officers and employees are authorized to provide courtesy notice for the immediate removal of the graffiti. The courtesy notice shall be accomplished in the most efficient and expeditious manner possible to include personal contact, electronic contact, telephonic contact or the posting of the property.

(b)  Declaration of public nuisance. If the city elects not to abate the graffiti under section 10-214(a), the notice of a declaration of public nuisance, appeal proceedings and liability for costs shall be provided for in sections 10-27 through 10-29 of this chapter. 
(c)  Emergency removal.

DIVISION 5. - EJECTMENT, EXCLUSIONS; REENTRY AS PUBLIC NUISANCE IN PUBLIC PLACES 

Sec. 10-70. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to achieve a balance between a person's interest in non-injurious access and use of public property and the public's expectation of reasonable access and appropriate use of public property without interference by a person or persons who have engaged in public nuisance behavior or criminal activity that resulted in an exclusion. In achieving this balance, the city would abate, albeit temporarily, the public nuisance that arises from the intentional misuse of public property by dangerous, disruptive and illegal conduct by a person. The city's use of a temporary denial of access by a nuisance offender is intended to enable the full and appropriate use of public property by protecting law abiding residents and tourists in their lawful use of public places. 
(b)  The institution of a city wide ordinance to achieve the protection of public's expectation of non-injurious use of public property is enabled by Title 5 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, specifically citing South Carolina Code of Laws § 5-7-30 to declare and abate public nuisances, and the protection of the public use of the public beaches arises from the police power and jurisdiction granted over public beaches, as enabled by South Carolina Code of Laws, § 5-7-30, § 5-7-145, § 5-7-150 and § 5-7-155. 
(c)  In exercise of its police power to preserve the public health, safety, welfare and economy, and to abate that conduct which becomes a public nuisance, this ordinance authorizes the appropriate city personnel to eject and exclude a person, who by their nuisance conduct or illegal conduct, should be barred from entering into specific public places or participating in facility uses for a determined time, where such violation is violent or disruptive of other city visitors, customers, city employees, the conduct of city operations and the peaceful and orderly use of the facility by others. 
(Ord. No. 2014-28, § 2, 5-13-14) 
Sec. 10-71. - Authority. 
(a)  In addition to and without limiting other civil or criminal remedies provided for violation of this code or any laws of the state of South Carolina, an appropriate city official or law enforcement officer may eject and exclude for a period of time any person from a public place who violates any applicable rules of conduct or provision of law in any place subject to this chapter, whose reentry thereafter within the specified period of time thereby creates a public nuisance. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the ejectment and exclusion of any person lawfully exercising free speech rights or other rights protected by the South Carolina or United States Constitution. However, a person engaged in such protected speech who also commits criminal acts is not protected from exclusion and shall be subject to exclusion as provided by this chapter. 
(c)  In addition to the general and specific rules of conduct set forth herein, the city manager or a designee, as the administrator of public assets, is authorized to make such rules and regulations implementing rules of conduct and not otherwise inconsistent or in conflict with other law as the city manager finds necessary for the better control and management of city property or public places, including buildings, parking facilities, parks, trails, and open space. The rules of conduct may be posted at various city properties in abbreviated form and are not meant to be all-inclusive of the conduct prohibited or required by this chapter. 
(d)  The city manager may delegate his or her authority granted herein for the promulgation of rules of conduct specific to a facility, and assign a person or persons to be in charge of the various city properties or public places for the purpose of enforcing rules of conduct. In addition, police and authorized employees shall have the authority to enforce the rules of conduct on city property, as deemed necessary by the person in charge, or when actually observed by the police officer or authorized employee.

(b)  If a person is issued a subsequent exclusion while a previous exclusion is stayed pending appeal (or pending judicial review, should a court stay the exclusion), the stay of the exclusion shall be counted in determining the appropriate length of the subsequent exclusion. If the previous exclusion is set aside, the term of the subsequent exclusion shall be reduced, as if the previous exclusion had not been issued. If multiple exclusions issued to a single person for one public place are simultaneously stayed pending appeal, the effective periods of those which are affirmed shall run consecutively. 
(Ord. No. 2014-28, § 2, 5-13-14) 
Sec. 10-76. - Warnings.

(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no warning shall be required if the person is to be ejected or excluded for engaging in conduct 
(1)  That is classified as a felony crime, or attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit a felony, or misdemeanor under Title 16, Chapter 1 of the Code of Laws of the State of South Carolina, or a misdemeanor crime under the Laws of the State of South Carolina and the Code of Ordinances for the City of Myrtle Beach, or

(a)  The appropriate city official or law enforcement officer must provide adequate notice to the person ejected and excluded from any public place that further reentry within a specified period of time shall result in the commission of a public nuisance. 
(b)  The method of delivery may be by regular mail or may be delivered orally in person, if it contemporaneously followed by an attestation of oral delivery by way of public record, and there is no reasonable means to achieve delivery of written notice because the offender has fled, there is no known address or way to ascertain an address or the person declines to accept a written notice. No signature attesting to the offending person's receipt is required when the appropriate city official or law enforcement officer attests to the impossibility of written service. 
(c)  When personal or mailed service is possible, the notice shall identify the offended rule, law or contain a brief description of the offending or public nuisance conduct, the places of exclusion, and the start date and end date of the exclusion period.

An appeal shall be filed by providing a written request for hearing within ten (10) business days of the date of the exclusion notice. Failure to file written notice of appeal within 10 business days will be deemed a waiver of any appeal rights to the city. 
(b)  The request for an appeal hearing must be in writing, contain a copy or description of the notice of exclusion, and a statement of the basis on which the decision to exclude is invalid, unauthorized, or otherwise improper. 
(c)  The city manager or his designee shall schedule a hearing on the appeal within fifteen (15) business days of receiving the request, unless the appellant requests a later date. Notice of the hearing time and date shall be given to the appellant and to the appropriate city official or law enforcement officer that issued the ejectment and exclusion notice. 
(d)  At the hearing, the appellant may contest the validity of the exclusion. The appropriate city official or officer shall have the burden of proving the validity of the exclusion by a preponderance of the evidence. Both parties may present evidence either by testimony or by written report. If the evidence is presented only by written report and the hearing officer cannot resolve a question by information contained in the reports, the hearing may be held open for a reasonable time to complete the record. 
(e)  If the hearing officer finds that the exclusion is valid, proper and in accordance with law, the hearing officer shall uphold the exclusion. If the hearing officer finds that the city has not met its burden of proof or that the exclusion is otherwise invalid, unauthorized or improper, then the hearing officer shall enter an order rescinding the exclusion. 
(f)  If an appeal of the exclusion is timely filed under this section, the effectiveness of the exclusion shall be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. If the exclusion is affirmed, the remaining period of exclusion shall be effective immediately upon the issuance of the decision, unless the hearing officer specifies a later effective date. 
(g)  The determination of the hearing officer is a final. Appeals from any determination by the hearing officer under this chapter shall be to the nuisance appeal board, as provided in law. 
(Ord. No. 2014-28, § 2, 5-13-14) 
Sec. 10-79. - Application for administrative waiver. 
(a)  At any time within the period of exclusion, a person receiving such notice of exclusion may apply in writing to the city manager for a limited waiver of some or all of the effects of the exclusion for good reason. If the city manager grants a waiver under this section, the city manager shall promptly notify the police chief, as applicable, of such action. 
(b)  In exercising discretion under this section, the city manager shall consider the seriousness of the violation for which the person has been excluded, the particular need of the person to be in the public place during some or all of the period of exclusion, such as for work or to attend or participate in a particular event (without regard to the content of any speech associated with that event), and any other criterion the city manager determines to be relevant to the determination of whether or not to grant a waiver. Notwithstanding the granting of a waiver under this section, the period of waiver will be included for purposes of calculating the appropriate length of exclusion. 
(c)  The decision of the city manager to grant or deny a waiver, in whole or in part, under this section is committed to the sole discretion of the city manager and is not subject to appeal or review by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2014-28, § 2, 5-13-14)

(a)  Definitions . The offense of breach of the peace is defined as a violation of public order, a disturbance of the public tranquility, by any act or conduct inciting to violence, which includes any violation of any law enacted to preserve peace and good order. The crux of the offense, and whether the conduct constitutes a breach of the peace depends on the time, place, and nearness of other persons. While it is not necessary that the peace actually be broken in order to sustain a conviction for the offense of breach of the peace, there must be at least the commission of an unlawful and unjustifiable act, tending with sufficient directness to breach the peace. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person within the city limits to intentionally engage in any act or conduct inciting public disorder or a breach of the peace in light of the surrounding circumstances of time, place or nearness of other persons, including but not limited to acts or conduct characterized: 
(1)  By making, uttering or directing toward another person any lewd, obscene or profane or libelous expletive or epithets or "fighting" words, which as a matter of common knowledge, when addressed to the ordinary citizen are inherently likely to provoke violent reactions, including but not limited to calls, threats and invitations to immediately engage in physical violence, fisticuffs, duel or personal combat; 
(2)  By being grossly intoxicated or appearing so appreciably impaired as to constitute a danger to one's self or to others; 
(3)  By being grossly intoxicated or appearing so appreciably impaired while noisy resisting lawful command; 
(4)  By being grossly intoxicated or appearing so appreciably impaired while engaging in lewd, obscene, profane, boisterous, riotous, tumultuous or violent acts or conduct, as those terms are commonly defined and understood; 
(5)  By knowingly and willfully engaging in any overt conduct that interferes with another's pursuit of a lawful occupation or activity, or that blocks or obstructs the passage of vehicles or pedestrians on a public way; 
(6)  By physically accosting or attempt to force one's company upon any person against their will; or 
(7)  By congregating with two or more persons in a public place so to block or obstruct passage, while refusing to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse.

WARNING ON POSSESION AND USE OF A LASER POINTER OR DEVICE 
PARENTS! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR MINORS! 
THIS PRODUCT CAN BE CONSIDERED A WEAPON! 
 Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient an operator of an airplane, helicopter or vehicle when the beam is directed toward them. The beam is much larger at long distances than you might think. Even though the laser projects a small, millimeter-sized dot close up, at longer distances the beam can be many inches across. When the beam hits the windscreen of a cockpit, or the bubble of a helicopter, imperfections in and on the glass spread the light out even more, making it impossible for the pilot to safely navigate. Pilot exposure to the beam can result in flash blindness, glare and distraction in the immediate task of piloting the aircraft. Pointing a laser at an aircraft places all the persons aboard in mortal jeopardy. 
 It is a federal felony crime to aim a laser pointer at an aircraft, or at the flight path of an aircraft. The federal penalty is up to five years in a federal prison and/or a fine of several thousand dollars. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration "will pursue the toughest penalties" against persons who deliberately aim lasers at aircraft, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced on May 16, 2012. Since June 2011, FAA has taken action against 28 persons, with an average fine of $11,000.00 per laser strike. The highest penalty sought so far is $30,800.00. FAA has directed its staff not to seek warning notices or counseling, but to use "moderately high civil penalties" for inadvertent laser illuminations, and maximum penalties for deliberate violations. The City of Myrtle Beach will inform the federal authorities of any arrests relating to this crime so that appropriate prosecution to the fullest extent of the law can be achieved at the federal level. 
 S.C. Code 1976, § 55-3-130 also makes it a criminal offense to point, aim, or discharge a laser device at an occupied aircraft, in the air or on the ground, providing a potential sentence for a first offense of one year in prison, a fine of $2,000.00, or both. A second or subsequent violation triggers the possibility of even greater sentencing. 
 A laser's light is concentrated into a narrow beam. If aimed at a person's eye from close up, most or all of the light goes through the pupil. The already-concentrated light is further focused by the lens onto a sharp ("diffraction-limited") dot on the retina. Even at the lower power outputs, the power density from a one milliwatt laser, focused to a point, is brighter than the equivalent area of the sun's surface. This can cause a detectable injury to the retina, if the laser stays in one spot for a few seconds. Laser beams can permanently blind a person or animal when the beam is directed into their eyes. 
 Any person of 17 years or older who possesses a laser pointer or device unlawfully, or who points a laser beam toward any vehicle, person or animal is subject to a conviction for violation of this ordinance, for assault and battery, and/or for mistreatment of animals, with a $500.00 fine and up to 30 days' imprisonment, or both, as well as being civilly liable for any personal injury to a person or animal, or damage to property, that might result from this illegal act. 
 PARENTS, GUARDIANS, RESPONSIBLE ADULTS: YOU WILL BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISUSE OF THIS DEVICE BY ANY MINOR TO WHOM YOU PROVIDE THIS DEVICE, OR BY ANY OTHER PERSON TO WHOM THAT MINOR PROVIDES THIS DEVICE. 
 Any parent, guardian, person acting in loco parentis, or responsible adult person, who purchases a laser pointer or device for a minor, or who allows a minor in their custody to access, possess or use a laser pointer or device within the unincorporated area of Horry County, and that laser pointer or device is possessed or used unlawfully, is subject to arrest and prosecution, and upon conviction, is further subject to a fine of $500.00 and up to 30 days' imprisonment, or both. The parent is chargeable as a principal to the crime along with the minor in possession, or who illegally uses the device as a weapon, and is also subject to prosecution for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
 Any minor 16 years or younger, who is in possession of, or who uses, a laser pointer or device unlawfully, is subject to service of a juvenile summons and will be prosecuted in family court by the solicitor's office. 
 Lasers in the unlawful possession of minors are subject to immediate confiscation as contraband, in addition to any other law enforcement action. 
 Laser pointers or devices that are used illegally are contraband, and subject to immediate confiscation, in addition to any other law enforcement action.

ARTICLE IX. - GASOLINE AND/OR DIESEL FUEL DRIVE OFFS 

Sec. 14-150. - Findings. 
    The council makes the following findings: 
    A number of motorists in the town are driving into business establishments with gasoline and/or diesel fuel pumps, filling their vehicles and/or containers with gasoline or diesel fuel, and thereafter immediately driving off without paying for same. For the year 2004, crime statistics evidence approximately 484 larcenies as a result of gas/diesel fuel drive offs without paying. For the year 2005, for the period of January 1 through April 11, prior to the influx of the tourist season, crime statistics show 208 larcenies as a result of gas/diesel fuel drive offs without paying. The stated level of crime results in significant man-hours/time extended by police officers, along with the administrative backup associated therewith. The stated man-hours/time by the police department detracts from proactive policing opportunities in regard to other community matters and more serious crimes. The stated level of crime adversely impacts the uniform crime reporting statistics, along with the negative fallout therefrom. The stated level of crime results in significant costs to, and monies being paid by, the city and its citizens/taxpayers. The stated level of crime with gas/diesel fuel drive offs without paying seriously and significantly adversely impacts the revenues of local business owners who own and operate business establishments involving the sale of gasoline and/or diesel fuel. The stated matters are of serious concern and should now be addressed and eliminated, if possible. This type of crime with its many adverse impacts can be addressed and, in fact, eliminated through the adoption of a zero tolerance policy. A zero tolerance policy in regard to this problem could be accomplished through the adoption of a payment in advance requirement for gasoline and diesel fuel sold throughout the city. Such a zero tolerance policy is imperative and in the best interests of the city and its citizens and, as such, the same is adopted. 
(Ord. No. 2005-29, 5-24-05)

The regulations set forth herein shall apply to all business establishments with gasoline and/or diesel fuel pumps located thereon, engaged in the selling of gasoline and/or diesel fuel, and located in the corporate limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2005-29, 5-24-05) 
Sec. 14-152. - Payment in advance required. 
    All business establishments with gasoline and/or diesel fuel pumps located thereon must require full payment in advance for any quantity of gasoline or diesel fuel sold at any time. This requires the business establishment and its representatives to receive payment in full prior to activating the gasoline or diesel fuel pumping device. Payment includes purchase by any legal means: cash, credit card, debit card, checks or otherwise.

DIVISION 1. - FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 14-300. - Purposes, findings and declarations. 
    The city council finds that the rights-of-way and public places are expected to be used for the purposes for which they were designed and constructed, to perform the function of public access, business advancement, and safe vehicular and pedestrian travel, while simultaneously allowing the constitutionally protected right of free speech in those portions of public property that have historically and traditionally been forums of free speech. These reasonable public expectations should be balanced with reasonable time, place and manner restrictions so that all citizens and visitors may safely enjoy the full function of these public facilities, and the purposes for which they are intended. 
    There are other places to which the public is invited that are on private property. As part of a pleasing aesthetic environment that enhances our tourist trade, businesses are required by zoning to set aside and maintain privately owned landscaped areas or open space areas that abut the public right-of-way or that are accessible by the public right-of-way. This private property is readily accessible to the general public, or is otherwise open to common or general use or view such as parking lots, landscaped areas or private alleys. There exist vacant or undeveloped land and lots through which the public has passed without obstruction. All of these private properties are impacted by the public right-of-way, and impact the right-of-way when obstructions are allowed to exist. 
    In some areas, sidewalks are only five feet in width, and whose uses are further restricted by necessary utility structures, street trees and refuse collection containers. In some areas, streets are 40 to 60 feet wide, and are heavily traveled access routes for the beach. Even nonaggressive monetary solicitation impedes the normal flow of traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, disrupts passage and is inherently more intrusive and complicated activity than the mere distributing literature. Certain streets and sidewalks of Myrtle Beach are subject to congestion, and the council finds that restrictions on conduct and all aggressive and nonaggressive solicitation that results in obstruction of passage, inaccessible parking, congesting vehicle traffic and stressful and anxious pedestrian interactions are appropriate in order to keep the traffic moving. 
    This commercial area of pedestrian and vehicular concentration and congestion compels the council to act to prohibit begging and panhandling city wide. Even nonaggressive solicitation has an element of coercion, and impedes the normal flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic , in that solicitation requires reaction and action by those who would respond. The concentration of amusements, outdoor seating and cafés, where visitors and citizens are queuing or seated for service or attractions requires protection of the commercial interests, and the comfort and safety of the customer. Moreover, the concentration of national and international visitors, who find themselves under stress in unfamiliar settings, often time facing a language or cultural barrier, when approached by strangers seeming demanding something from them. Even if the language barrier is overcome, and being faced by a stranger in a strange town is not stressful or creates anxiety, the individual solicited must decide whether or not to contribute (which itself might involve examining the solicitor's goods, or enticements to commerce, or hearing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for a wallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a credit card. 
    Both nonaggressive and aggressive solicitations in these densely peopled areas or in areas do create a besieged atmosphere, and makes people feel uncertain and unsafe as they move about. The council is informed that visitors often act to avoid being solicited, perceiving that they are being constantly set upon by the solicitors asking for money, asking for donations, asking for a contribution, asking for spare change, asking for a dollar in exchange for some form of goods, and the uncertainty of how to respond and the inconvenience of dealing with strangers approaching you in an unfamiliar area in a tourist town diminishes the safety and convenience of the citizens and visitors, thus impacting the public economy. The city has a legitimate interest in promoting the safety and convenience of its tourists and citizens on public streets in these densely peopled areas, and so would create a protected zone, while still allowing such solicitations and commercial handbilling elsewhere in the city, and would still allow noncommercial handbilling as set forth herein in as exercise of the First Amendment under reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. 
    The Myrtle Beach Convention Center and its premises are declared to be a unique structure and land use dedicated to the convention center business model as a commercial facility to foster economic development and use by businesses and organizations which reserve and rent the facility and its premises to convey their commercial message. The unique characteristics of this convention center business model compel that it is to be subject to time, place and manner restrictions as to use and speech, and that sections may vary as to the use and speech appropriate for the section. 
    There also exist publicly owned facilities such as the oceanfront and the Myrtle Beach Convention Center that were not designed or built to be in the same categories as the public streets and parks as forums for expressive activities. There also exist publicly owned land which has been legislatively made subject to encroachment to enhance the commercial activity of the abutting private property, such as ocean front and sometimes Boardwalk adjacent hard and soft encroachments. 
    The Myrtle Beach Boardwalk is declared to be a unique structure of limited recreational use and passage, designed and built not as sidewalk or street, park or traditional public forum, but a tourist and resident amenity, and as public facility stimulus to foster economic development and commercial encroachment use by a abutting businesses by extending outdoor dining and seating for its patrons. It extends from its northern terminus at the 15th Avenue North Pier to its southern terminus at 1st Avenue North Street End. The northern section is from 14th Avenue North Pier to the northern border of Plyler Park, characterized entirely by hotel beach frontage. The central section extends from the northern border of Plyler Park the southern border of 8th Avenue North, characterized entirely by retail and entertainment business. The southern section is from the southern 8th Avenue North to the southern terminus at 1st Avenue North, characterized by a mixture of hotel and retail, predominantly hotel frontage. The current boardwalk is likely to be augmented in both the southern and northern directions, and the restrictions set forth herein will apply to any later additions to the boardwalk. The unique characteristics of changing zoning uses with its mixture of encouraged commercial encroachment use, tourist residential and recreational use compel that it is to be distinguished from quintessential public forums, and its uniqueness requires that it be subject to time, place and manner restrictions as to use, and that sections of the boardwalk may vary as to the use appropriate for the section. The city council finds that the boardwalk should not be used as a forum for either nonaggressive or aggressive off premise canvassing, begging, solicitation in exchange for money, handbilling or picketing due to its unique recreational nature. 
    The public beach is a unique asset, and millions of visitors are drawn to the public beaches every year, and year round. The public beaches are used for entertainment and recreational purposes, and commercialization detracts from that use. Visitors do not want to be accosted or approached in effort to sell them something, or persuade them on an issue, while they are lying down with their eyes closed, sunbathing, or attending to their small children. Ample opportunities and places currently exist for citizens to engage in person to person commercial endeavors, nonaggressive begging, handbilling or picketing under this article, and the city council finds that the public beach should not be used as a forum for either nonaggressive or aggressive off premise canvassing, begging, solicitation in exchange for money, handbilling or picketing due to its unique recreational nature. 
    The city council finds that public has a reasonable expectation that public parks designed, built and maintained for different purposes may be enjoyed for those purposes, while still maintaining the public park as a forum for expressive activities. Parks are designed for families with children, individuals and group to engage in fellowship, play and relaxation in a pastoral setting. The council is informed that both nonaggressive and aggressive solicitations in these areas does create a besieged and uncertain atmosphere, making people feel unsafe as they move about, or rest in a park, or play with their children. The council finds that persons perceive that they are being constantly set upon by the strangers walking up to them or their children, asking for money, asking for donations, asking for a contribution, asking for spare change, asking for a dollar in exchange for some form of goods, and the mere act of being approached in a demanding way by a stranger creates uncertainty of how to respond and the inconvenience of dealing with strangers approaching you as you engage in your park use with your children or grandchildren, or as you try to relax. The city has a legitimate interest in promoting the safety and convenience of its citizens in the parks. Ample opportunities and places currently exist outside of the parks for citizens to engage in person to person commercial endeavors or commercial handbilling under this article, and the city council finds that the public parks should not be used as a forum for panhandling, off premise canvassing, solicitation in exchange for money or commercial handbilling due to its reasonable expectations that public parks are not appropriate for unrestricted commercial activity, and have the same need for public safety and convenience that exists in the protected zone. 
    The city council finds and declares that uncontrolled commercial and noncommercial speech involved in handbilling, picketing, soliciting and canvassing results in negative impacts on the rights-of-way, negative impacts on the use of public facilities by visitors and citizens, and often in the throwing, casting and distributing of material upon public and residential property, without consent, thus creating widespread litter that adversely affects the aesthetics of the rights-of-way in the city. 
    Neighborhood litter contributes to a serious police problem in that the accumulation of the material on the right-of-way and neighbors express that the property of the residence so littered is an open invitation to burglary. 
    The city council finds that unregulated camping in prohibited public places creates a health and safety hazard for those who illegally camp, and for those residents and visitors who come into contact with the campsites, and adversely affects the quality of life of a considerable number of citizens. 
    The city council finds that a public safety problem is created by persons sleeping in automobiles which are parked along the public streets within the city. In residential areas, alarm and anxiety result in calls for service. In addition, persons who are parked in developed areas, by the nature of the conduct become unaware of their surrounding, this making themselves vulnerable as targets for criminal activity. 
    As to public sidewalks, the city council further finds and declares: 
(1)  Public sidewalks in business districts are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing potential customers with convenient access to goods and services. 
(2)  During business hours, the public sidewalks in downtown and neighborhood commercial areas are prone to congestion and should be kept available to serve these primary purposes. 
(3)  Except in places provided herein or where reasonably necessary, sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in downtown and neighborhood commercial interferes with the primary purposes of the public sidewalks, threatens public safety and damages the public welfare. 
(4)  Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled or vision-impaired, are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk. 
(5)  The public welfare is promoted by economically healthy downtown neighborhood commercial areas which attract people to shop, work and recreate. These areas provide easily accessible goods and services, employment opportunities, the tax revenues necessary to support essential public services, and the economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve property within these areas. 
(6)  In some circumstances and places in the city, obstruction of passage by congregation, or sitting or lying on the sidewalks acts to deter many members of the public from frequenting those areas, which contributes to undermining the essential economic viability of those areas. Business failures and relocations can cause vacant storefronts which contribute to a spiral of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare. An important factor in protecting public safety is attracting people to the streets and sidewalks of the city's business districts, because the presence of many law abiding citizens serves as a deterrent to crime and increases the public's sense of security and the safety of all. 
(7)  There are other places within or close to the downtown and neighborhood commercial areas where sitting or lying down can be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic, impairing commercial activity, threatening public safety or harming the public welfare. These other places include city parks, private property with the permission of the property owner, public sidewalks outside the designated business districts and all sidewalks outside the designated hours. Therefore, the limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks is both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. 
    Publicly accessible parking garages lots are characterized by the constant travel of vehicles in restricted spaces and lanes. The use of individual wheeled devices that do not have a mechanical braking system are incompatible with the travel of vehicles in this context, and such use presents a real danger of personal and property injury. 
    Now therefore, the city council finds that the inappropriate use of the right-of-way and restricted public places is injurious and inimical to the public economy, health, safety and welfare of the visitors and residents and that such practices are, therefore, declared to unlawful and a public nuisance.

ARTICLE III. - ALLEY RELOCATION/CONSOLIDATION POLICY 

Sec. 15-40. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this policy is to provide minimum standards to guide city council in determining when it is necessary for the improvement or convenience of the city to close, abandon, or relocate alleys within the area east of Kings Highway and between 11th Avenue North and 29th Avenue North (the alleyway district). It is intended that these standards will be of assistance to property owners and developers in planning redevelopment projects within the alleyway district and in preparing requests for council action. In each case of the closure, abandonment, or relocation of an alley, the applicant shall submit a plan for redevelopment. Legislative action by city council will be required and, although city council will be required by the terms of this article to consider the established standards, it retains the right to approve or disapprove such action as it believes to be in the best interest of the city based on such other or further considerations as it determines to be relevant at the time. 
(Ord. No. 94-36, 7-26-94) 
Sec. 15-41. - General considerations. 
(a)  City council should not abandon any oceanfront alley right-of-way east of Ocean Boulevard within the alleyway district at the request of one or more adjoining property owners unless at the same time it receives for the benefit of the public, oceanfront land within the alleyway district of at least comparable area and beach frontage which will maintain or improve public access to the beach. 
(b)  City council should not abandon any alley right-of-way at the request of one or more property owners if, in council's judgment, such abandonment will have a direct negative impact on another property owner in the district. 
(c)  City council should not abandon multiple alley rights-of-way if such abandonment would have the effect of combining more than four of the lots existing on the effective date of this ordinance. The purpose of this provision is to prevent long expanses (in excess of 300 feet) between public beach access points. In any event, no structure or the aggregate of structures constructed on the combined property shall be more than 240 feet in width as measured essentially parallel to the right-of-way of Ocean Boulevard. 
(d)  City council should not abandon a non-oceanfront alley at the request of one or more adjoining property owners unless it receives from those property owners, for the benefit of the public, land of equal or greater value on either the second or third row. Land values shall be determined by a properly certified appraiser selected by the city manager and the cost of appraisal shall be paid by the party or parties requesting the abandonment. 
(e)  Whenever possible, land received by the city as a result of alley abandonment pursuant to this policy should be adjacent to existing public rights-of-way or other public property. A strong preference should be given to expanding the width of existing streetends in order to create significant large beach access points. 
(f)  Those property owners who acquire the alleyway property when abandoned by the city, to justify the abandonment shall, in addition to providing comparable land to the city for the benefit of the public, be required to pay per alleyway, one percent of the construction cost of the development project presented to city council or $40,000.00, whichever is greater. 
(g)  If the closing and abandoning of an alley east of Ocean Boulevard results in the combination of two or more lots, the owner of the combined lot shall, in addition to the requirements in subsections (a) and (f), above, be required to convey to the city a ten-foot-wide easement for public pedestrian access across all sideyard building setbacks of the combined lot which are not immediately adjacent to a public right-of-way or other public pedestrian accessway. 
(h)  Whenever an alley is abandoned, if the property immediately across a right-of-way generally northwest of the property from the abandoned alley is not owned by the owner of the newly combined lot which results from the abandonment, the uses to be made of the alley shall be limited so that it will continue to offer the same view to the ocean and a 90 degree vertical view of the sky measured from the ground to the sky as existed for property on the date of abandonment. In this situation, uses of the abandoned alley shall be limited as follows, which limitations shall be evidenced in a deed restriction executed and filed by the owner of the combined lot: 
(1)  No structures may be erected in the space of the abandoned alley or within five feet of either side of the abandoned alley. 
(2)  No vehicular use shall be allowed within the abandoned alley or within five feet either side of the abandoned alley. 
(3)  An easement shall be granted for public pedestrian beach access within the width of the abandoned alley and the five-foot building setbacks on either side of the alley. Improvements within the easement, as approved by city council, shall be made by the property owners at their own expense. 
(4)  Land within the abandoned alley may be used to calculate the buildable area of the combined lots and to meet landscaping requirements of the city's zoning ordinance. 
The limitations contained in this subsection (h) shall not be applicable if the property directly across Ocean Boulevard from the abandoned alley is a parking garage three or more stories high.

(2)  Field inspections: Illicit discharge field inspections will be scheduled and unscheduled. The Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Manual will serve as guidance when city personnel perform the illicit discharge inspections. 
Because of public health duties and under general police power to address public health concerns arising from illicit discharge, city personnel may enter and inspect. Upon request, property owners shall disarm security systems and remove obstructions for safe and easy access to the property. 
(3)  Removal or correcting an illicit discharge: Once the source of the discharge is identified the discharge must be removed from the system, or terminated. The city will determine who is responsible for repairs (physical and environmental) to the drainage system. If the responsible party is the city, then a work order will be issued and completed within a timely manner. If the responsible party is a private property owner, then a written notice of correction will be distributed. Non-compliance with the notice of correction will prompt enforcement measures and penalties in accordance with the city stormwater ordinance, section 18-44 "Enforcement" and section 18-45 "Penalties". 
(4)  Emergency spill response: Emergency spill responses will be coordinated with the city public works, police, and fire departments. The Standard Operating Guidelines (EMER-7) from the fire department will be the governing procedural document for emergency spills.

(f)  Soil erosion and sediment control plan. Proper erosion control measures are required on each construction site such that soil or sand will not be transported off the property by stormwater runoff. A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be prepared and submitted as part of the stormwater management and sediment control plan. This plan will be included in and be a part of the final approved project drawings and will be kept on the construction site. The purpose of the soil erosion and sediment control plan is to provide measures to control erosion and sedimentation generated by removal of ground surface cover. 
(1)  Soil erosion and sediment control plan guidelines. 
a.  Slopes should be protected from erosion by quick establishment of vegetative cover, benches or terraces, slope protection structures, mulches, or a combination of these practices as required. It is hereby recommended that Pensacola Bahia or other rapid root development grasses be utilized as a permanent vegetative cover. 
b.  Drainage channels should be designed to avoid erosion problems. Wide channels with flat side slopes lined with grass or other vegetation shall be utilized where feasible. Where channel gradients are steep, concrete linings or grade control structures, such as stone check dams, may be required. Every effort should be made to preserve natural channels. 
c.  Sediment basins shall be constructed to discharge stormwater runoff while trapping sediment loads. Sediment basins may either be temporary or permanent, as required by the city engineer, and be designed with 80 percent total suspended solids removal efficiency. 
d.  Detention basins may also be used to trap sediment during and after development. Where used for this purpose, the basin shall continue to detain stormwater in accordance with the hydraulic design criteria, but allow for the settlement and containment of sediment in the basin. Sediment shall be removed periodically to ensure the intended performance of the detention basin. 
e.  Existing vegetation, adequate to control erosion, shall be preserved. Regeneration of wood plants shall be encouraged. 
f.  Silt fences or other measures may be placed around storm sewer inlets and at the boundaries of disturbed areas to trap sediment on site. 
g.  Other measures specifically approved by the city engineer or engineering division personnel. 
(2)  Contents of soil erosion and sediment control plan. 
a.  Location, scope and manner of performing temporary and permanent erosion control measures; 
b.  Procedures shall provide that all sediment and erosion controls are inspected at least once every 7-calendar days or at least once every 14-calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater; 
c.  Proposed construction sequence and time schedule for all earth-disturbing activities and installation of provisions for erosion and sediment control and stormwater management; and 
d.  Design computations and applicable assumptions for all structural measures for erosion and sediment control. Volume and velocity must be given for all surface water conveyance measures and pipe discharges. 
(g)  Permanent flow control design standards. 
(1)  The peak rate of discharge from a site after the proposed development or redevelopment shall approximate the peak rate of discharge from the site prior to development or redevelopment and shall not exceed the latter for 25-year-frequency, 24-hour duration storms. In addition, the cumulative impact of the outflow hydrograph on downstream flows shall be considered. Runoff rates in excess of predevelopment rates shall be accommodated in an approved manner on site. 
(2)  The volume of runoff from a site after development or redevelopment shall approximate the volume of runoff from the site prior to development or redevelopment and shall not exceed the latter volume for a 25-year-frequency storm unless the intent of this provision will be met through detention of the difference between said volumes, in which case said volume differences may be released over not less than a 24-hour period of time nor more than 72 hours. 
(3)  As a minimum the first inch of rainfall from each storm over the developed portion of the site shall be retained on site. For soil conditions or groundwater table conditions, which do not permit the percolation of this volume within the five days following a storm event, the city engineer may approve detention with filtration systems in lieu of retention. 
(4)  Channeling runoff directly on the beach shall be prohibited. 
(5)  Runoff from higher adjacent or upstream offsite lands shall be considered and provision for such runoff shall be included. 
(6)  Water shall be released into watercourses and wetlands at a rate and in a manner approximating the natural flow that would have occurred before development and outflows shall be designed to minimize erosion. 
(7)  Vegetated buffer strips shall be created and/or preferably retained in their natural state along the banks of all watercourses, waterbodies or wetlands. The buffer shall be wide enough to allow for periodic flooding, provide access to the waterbody and act as a filter to trap sediment in runoff. 
(8)  The use of drainage facilities and vegetated buffer strips as open space, recreation and conservation areas shall be encouraged. 
(9)  No direct connections shall be permitted between roof drains and the offsite storm sewer system. Water should be routed through stormwater management facilities. 
(10)  The city engineer may require such data as he determines necessary from the applicant to prove the adequacy of the design of the stormwater system. 
(11)  The hydrologic requirements for sites over two acres in size, mandated by this chapter, shall be developed in accordance with the latest releases and revisions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Services' Technical Release No. 55, entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," and SCS National Engineering Handbook, Section 4, entitled "Hydrology." Sites two acres or less may be assessed by the Rational Method. 
(12)  If an identified storm drainage basin is master planned for discharging storm water to the Atlantic Ocean or Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, conditions may be met to waive the requirement for retention and/or detention as follows: During a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event, if the discharge structure and the internal collection system can transport the total amount of run-off from impervious surface areas that do not exceed 90 percent of the total surface area for the run-off basin, then the city may waive the quantity requirements of this section provided that the quality standards set for the basin are met through the use of Best Management Practices (BMP) accepted by OOCRM and the city. The city's waiver of the quantity requirements must be approved by the OOCRM. If the basin discharges to the Atlantic Ocean, direct discharge over the tidal beach will not be allowed. For the purpose of this section, BMP is a structural or nonstructural device designed specifically to improve the quality of stormwater runoff. OCRM means the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and is a division of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control with regulatory authority over receiving bodies of water. 
(h)  Single family and duplex residences. 
(1)  A permit application for a single family house or duplex shall include a site development drawing containing the following features: 
a.  Tax map number, subdivision name and lot and block number. 
b.  A site development map to scale (1 inch = 20 feet or larger). Survey data should be on this map or on a separate attached map. 
c.  Elevation of the center of the road, all property corners, at 25-feet intervals along and 5-feet beyond each property line, and at any distinguishing feature on or off site that could in any way impact stormwater flow from the property. 
d.  Any existing and proposed watercourse, wetland, ditches, swales, pipes, culverts, catch basins, etc. 
e.  Proposed house foot print and finished floor elevation, including proposed ground elevations at house corners. 
f.  Footprints and elevations of any swimming pools, spas, decks, driveways, etc. 
g.  Any fence location and type of construction. 
h.  Include drainage flow direction arrows. 
i.  Roof downspouts and associated piping. 
j.  Adjacent roads, ditches, pipelines and culverts. 
(2)  The public works director or his designee may waive any of the above requirements at its sole discretion. 
(3)  The public works department reserves the right to perform an on site visit to all construction sites of single-family homes and duplexes prior to plan review and approval. 
(Ord. No. 2007-51, 8-14-07) 
Sec. 18-25. - Responsibility for maintenance. 
(a)  The applicant engaged in or conducting the development activity shall be responsible for maintaining all temporary stormwater runoff control measures and facilities during the development of a site. 
(b)  The responsibility for maintaining all permanent runoff control measures and facilities after site development is completed shall lie with the landowner unless a facility is officially accepted by the city for city maintenance. That will be allowed only when the system is part of a subdivision, a multiple lot or area plan, or when the improvements are completely contained in a dedicated right-of-way. 
(c)  Sufficient inspection shall be made to ensure compliance with the specifications set forth in this chapter. A registered engineer, employed by the developer, shall certify in writing to the city that he has inspected each phase of the construction of the storm drainage improvements required in this chapter. The city, however, shall make a final inspection of said improvements before accepting any such improvements for dedication to the city for permanent maintenance. 
(c)  Once installed and inspected, the stormwater control facilities shall be maintained in one of the following ways and approved as part of the stormwater management and sediment control plan: 
(1)  Facilities maintained by owner. The system(s) to be maintained by the owner shall provide adequate access to permit the city to inspect and, if necessary, to take corrective action. Should the owner fail to properly maintain the system(s) under his responsibility, the city shall give such owner written notice of the nature of the corrective action necessary. Should the owner fail, within 30 days from the date of the notice, to take, or commence taking, corrective action to the satisfaction of the city, the city may enter upon lands, take corrective action and place a lien on the property of the owner for the costs thereof or enter into condemnation proceedings. For purposes of this section, the term "owner" shall also mean "homeowner association" or other collective member organizations. 
(2)  Facilities maintained by the city. All areas and/or structures to be maintained by the city must be designed and constructed consistent with the requirements of this chapter and dedicated to the city by deed with attached record drawings and a one-year warranty for defects in materials and workmanship. 
A letter of credit or a maintenance bond shall be provided to the city in an amount equivalent to ten percent of the cost of the improvements dedicated to the city. Such letter of credit or maintenance bond shall be held by the city for a one-year period following dedication of said improvements to the city.

Sec. 18-61. - Stormwater management fee. 
(a)  The stormwater management fee shall be charged to all developed sites located within the corporate limits of the city, as they may exist from time to time. 
(b)  City council shall establish a fee schedule under this article, which sets forth the amounts and classifications of fees to be implemented to recover the costs of maintaining and operating the stormwater system. Fees may be changed by resolution of city council from time to time and are on file in the city clerk's office. City council shall consider, among other things, the following criteria in establishing fees: 
(1)  The fee system shall be apportioned on a reasonable basis with due regard for the benefits conferred. City council recognizes that these benefits, while substantial, in many cases cannot be measured directly; 
(2)  Design, construction, maintenance, and the overall operation of the stormwater management program shall be borne proportionately by all classifications of property owners in the city in that all will enjoy the direct and indirect benefits of an improved and well-maintained system; 
(3)  In establishing the fee, the following costs may be considered: 
a.  Stormwater management and sediment control planning and preparation of comprehensive watershed master plans for stormwater management; 
b.  Regular inspections of public and private stormwater management facilities during construction and operation; 
c.  Maintenance and improvement of stormwater management facilities that have been accepted by the city for that purpose; 
d.  Plan review and inspection of sediment control and stormwater management and sediment control plans, measures, and practices; 
e.  Retrofitting designated watersheds to reduce existing flooding problems or to improve water quality; 
f.  Acquisition of interests in land, including easements; 
g.  General administration, enforcement, billing and collection; and 
h.  Water quantity and water quality management, including monitoring and surveillance. 
(4)  Practical difficulties and limitations shall be considered in establishing, calculating, and administering such fees; and 
(c)  The rate for one ERU is the standard for calculating the fee for each developed site. 
(Ord. No. 2007-51, 8-14-07) 
Sec. 18-62. - Calculation of fee and methods of assessment.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 19-1. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2012-52, adopted Aug. 28, 2012, repealed § 19-1, which pertained to excavations or removal of materials from streets and other public property and derived from Code 1980, § 3-1-1. 
Sec. 19-2. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2012-52, adopted Aug. 28, 2012, repealed § 19-2, which pertained to expectoration on sidewalks and derived from Code 1980, § 3-1-3. 
Sec. 19-3. - Obstructions and surface and air encroachments on public property. 
(a)  Generally prohibited. No person shall encroach upon any public place except as authorized by law, either as set forth herein or specifically permitted in zoning districts having zero lot lines. To encroach means to construct, erect or maintain on, in, over or under any public place, right-of-way, roadway, parking strip and/or sidewalk, including the air space above them, any unauthorized vegetation, sign, building extension, staging, scaffold, marquee, clock, retaining wall or any other building or structure, or object, or to occupy a public right-of-way during construction activities for equipment or storage. Except as provided in section 19-5 or as permitted by law, all encroachments are obstructions, deemed to be public nuisances, and are prohibited, except as follows: The abutting property owner may be permitted to beautify it by the planting of grass when such does not interfere with the purpose of the city. In the context of this section, "grass" is a narrow leaved green herbage of the Gramineae family that does not exceed 12 inches in height. The abutting property owner may be permitted to install a "breakaway" mailbox with supports no larger than four inches by four inches, or a two-inch diameter standard steel or aluminum pipe, buried no more than 24 inches in the ground. If the public right-of-way includes a city-permitted curb, the abutting property owner may be permitted to beautify that portion of the public property by the planting of landscaping vegetation only; provided however that no vegetation other than grass may be planted within five feet of the curb, and no vegetation at maturity shall exceed 30 inches in height. Plants such as yucca, cacti or similar thorny plants are prohibited. No vegetation may be planted in proximity to a traffic control device so that its potential growth may obscure or diminish conspicuousness of the device, regardless of the presence of a curb. In the context of this section, "curb" is a concrete border forming part of a gutter along the edge of a street. 
(b)  Encroachments generally. There are, on occasion, reasons for property owners to request they be allowed to encroach onto the city right-of-way and/or the airspace above a sidewalk or street or other public space within the city limits. It is the city's intent to carefully consider the merits of proposed encroachments within certain limitations. Commercial requests for encroachment may be considered differently than residential requests. The intent of this policy is to balance the reasonable requests of abutting property owners and the health, safety, welfare and convenience of the public, particularly in regards to beach access and parking in the sensitive areas of public beach access. Any encroachment granted pursuant to this section is considered temporary in nature, conveys no right or interest in property and is revocable at will by the city. No encroachment is permitted upon the opened or unopened streets or street ends or upon any sidewalk except as authorized by council pursuant to ordinance. No encroachment may decrease public parking areas. For encroachments on state owned rights-of-way, the applicant shall first secure a city permit before seeking a state permit. On encroachments on state owned rights-of-way, the city may grant a limited encroachment to the extent of its duties and obligations in regards to the state owned rights-of-way; provided however, a city issued permit shall not be valid unless and until a permit is issued on a state owned right-of-way. For city purposes, encroachment permits and liability insurance naming the city as an additional insured are not required if the encroachment is merely one of the three exceptions listed in [subsection] 19-3(a). A permit is required for all residential and commercial encroachments, other than those listed as exceptions in [subsection] 19-3(a), provided however liability insurance is not required for landscaping encroachments made pursuant to this section. An annual fee of $500.00 shall be assessed on all commercial properties. for every type of encroachment. 
(c)  Application to the planning commission. An application to the planning commission for a revocable permit to encroach on city owned property shall be made by and in the name of the owner or the person acting in behalf of the owner, as shown by sworn statement. All applications shall be reviewed by the planning commission based upon its role of implementing the comprehensive plan and in light of the factors found in this section. When recommendations are required under this section, such recommendations of the commission are not binding upon the city council. Furthermore, by resolution, the city council may reverse or modify any action by the planning commission in regards to any decision made under this section. 
(d)  Application and statement. The application shall set forth the name and address of the applicant, the nature and description of the proposed encroachment including layout, plant choice, etc, the location and description of city-owned property proposed to be encroached upon, the nature of the applicant's interest in and the location and the legal description of the property in connection with which the permit is sought to be obtained, the reasons for the application, such other information, including plats, as may be required by the planning office, and the following statement, attested to and witnessed under oath: 
State of South Carolina 
County of Horry 
ENCROACHMENT PERMIT RELATING TO PRIVATE PROPERTY 
TMS# _______ That, I am the owner of property located at _______ , designated on the tax map roles of Horry County as TMS# _______ , and that I, the undersigned have authority to bind and covenant on behalf of myself or the entity represented that I understand and agree that any permit issued hereon regarding an encroachment on abutting public property shall be issued pursuant and subject to the provisions of law; that such permit may be revoked by the city, acting by and through its city council or manager, at any time and that the encroachment must be removed within 30 days thereafter; that the city shall have the absolute right to remove the encroachment for any purpose at any time and shall not be required to replace or repair any encroachment so removed and shall be held harmless for any result from such removal; that no right, title or interest in any property owned by the city or expectation of continuation of encroachment shall vest or accrue to me by any reason of the issuance of such permit or exercise of the privilege given thereby; that I will not suffer or permit any dangerous or defective condition of property to exist in connection with the exercise of the privilege; that I am solely responsible for any maintenance or upkeep of the encroachment, and that I, either individually or on behalf of the entity I represent, am solely responsible for any liability which may result from the existence of the encroachment and that I will hold harmless the city for any damages arising out of, from or in connection with the exercise of the privilege granted by the issuance of the permit sought; and that I acknowledge that, if the requested permit is for anything other than landscaping vegetation, I must carry liability insurance in the amount of $500,000.00 per occurrence for as long as I encroach, naming the city as an additional insured, with notice of cancellation, and proof of insurance by way of certificate. Notice of a change in ownership shall be provided within 30 days of the change. This form bearing my signature may be filed by the City of Myrtle Beach at the Horry County Register of Deeds in relation to my property to establish a public record that such encroachment shall not be considered as an interest in land. 
(e)  Landscaping permit by the planning commission. The planning commission is authorized to grant a residential or commercial landscaping encroachment permit, without a requirement of review by city council, if the requested encroachment is landscaping vegetation not greater than 30 inches in height at maturity; provided however that, in rights-of-way that do not include a public curb, no planting of new vegetation other than grasses shall be permitted in the area within ten feet of the paved roadway without city council approval, and in areas that do not include a public curb and that have an approach to a traffic control device, nothing but grasses may be planted for a distance of 30 feet on approach; and in rights-of-way that do include a public curb, no planting of new vegetation other than grasses shall be permitted within five feet of the curb. This delegation of authority for limited temporary encroachment privilege of this nature in no way restricts the legislative power or discretion of city council to act in the interest of public health, safety, welfare or convenience in regards to the rights-of-way, regardless of the permit or privilege of landscaping contemplated within this section. The application shall be filed with the planning director and shall be referred by him to other departments as might be affected by the issuance of this permit for their recommendation and comments. After such reference, the planning commission may approve such application and issue the permit requested if the application shows: The proposed encroachment would not interfere with the meaningful use of adjoining property, or cause public property to become unsightly, unkempt or be incompatible in use or appearance with neighboring properties; the proposed encroachment would not negatively affect existing or proposed vehicular or pedestrian ways, or become dangerous or hazardous to the public when used by the public for the purpose for which it was intended to be used; the choice of plant materialsor layout of the proposed encroachment will not itself become a dangerous or defective condition or unreasonably endanger or interfere with the public health, safety or convenience; the encroachment will not utilize bricks, pavers, timbers or other materials other than vegetation or utilize any underground piping within the ten feet of grassy area or interfere with any existing underground utilities; the encroachment will not negatively affect public accessibility to the beach and oceanfront, or pedestrian traffic; and the issuance of the permit is otherwise in the interests of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(f)  Planning commission action. If an application is made to the planning commission which does not meet the conditions as stated in this section, the planning commission shall deny such application or may offer a conditional approval upon the applicant's consent to such terms and conditions as the commission deems necessary to make the proposed encroachment meet the standards of this section. 
(g)  City council review. An applicant has the right to submit to city council any petition regarding a denied application. City council may act in full discretion regarding encroachments on public rights-of-way. 
(h)  Encroachments other than landscaping. 
a.  Any application involving any object or structure, timber, stone or other material affixed onto or into the ground, or the paving or placement or maintenance of any material, other than exceptions listed in [subsection] 19-3(a) or landscaping vegetation approved by the planning commission above, so as to create a visual impression upon the public of a demarcation between public and private ownership or to accommodate or discourage parking; or any application involving the placement or suspension of any object or structure so as to project over a public right-of-way, except as authorized by other law, must be the subject of a review and recommendation by the Planning Commission, before action by city council or the manager as provided herein; provided however that no permit is required for the exceptions listed in [subsection] 19-3(a). The manager is designated to approve non-breakaway mailbox placement with a base area not exceeding two feet by two feet with appropriate insurance provided, without further planning commission or council action. Any action by the city council shall be in the exercise of legislative discretion. 
b.  Within the boundaries of a defined mixed use development of 25 contiguous acres or more, under unified control or ownership, and subject to a redevelopment plan, an encroachment master plan may be implemented after review and approval by the planning commission and city council, provided that adequate insurance is maintained, the city is named as an additional insured pursuant to terms satisfactory to the city and the city is indemnified and held harmless from loss. Without limitation, such encroachments may include awnings, canopies, screens, balconies, cornice, scones, wayfinding signs, trellis structures, gazebos, benches, planters, play areas, kiosks, atms, fountains, bike racks, receptacles, door swings, flags, underground pipes and conduits, building foundation structures, grease traps, basins and separators, and historic markers. After approval by city council of the placement, the community appearance board shall review the master plan for aesthetic compatibility with the development. 
(i)  Planning commission consideration. The encroachment location shall be posted with a sign indicating notice of the public hearing ten days prior to the public hearing. In considering its recommendation to council, the planning commission shall make findings of facts on the following: The proposed encroachment, by layout or materials choice, presents no physical threat of safety to pedestrians, motor vehicle drivers and passengers, or others in lawful use of the right-of-way or public space, or to their property; the proposed encroachment is compatible in use and design with the right-of-way or public space; and the constructed extension or encroachment will increase the assessed value of the building to which it is attached and will not decrease the value of any building in the immediate vicinity. Restrictions and conditions may be imposed as to height, weight and dimensions of the encroachment, aesthetics, or the time period of the permit, as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of this section. The city manager may make such additional requirements as may be appropriate under customary business and legal practices. 
(j)  Termination, notice of removal, removal cost as a lien. Whenever the city makes a finding that the encroachment is not permitted or is no longer in compliance with the provisions of the criteria of this section, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the encroaching landscaping stating the deficiencies and corrective action required and providing 30 days from the date of notice for compliance. If the owner fails to achieve compliance within 30 days, the city manager shall be authorized to have the encroachment removed and the costs of removal and storage, if any, assessed as a lien against the property. 
(k)  Time for compliance. Upon the effective date of this section, all owners of property with a lawfully granted encroachment previously granted shall be grandfathered as to any requirement, subject however to the city council legislative discretion to act at any time on matters of the public health, safety, welfare, convenience, and economy. Upon the effective date of this section, all owners of property with an unlawfully existing encroachment, whether vegetation or otherwise, shall have 30 days, upon notice from the city, to submit an application for a lawful encroachment or approval. If approved by the appropriate person or body, the encroachment shall be permitted to remain. If not approved or if no application is made, any encroachment not being lawfully permitted is declared to be a public nuisance and may be removed at the discretion of the manager and the cost of removal, if any may be assessed as alien against the property.

DIVISION 2. - REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS 

Sec. 19-111. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all public streets, private driveways (serving more than three units), and all buildings (including residential, commercial, industrial, and public) within the city limits. 
(Code 1980, § 5-8-11) 
Sec. 19-112. - Street naming standards. 
(a)  New streets. Proposed streets which are obviously on alignment with other existing and named streets shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix, "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," "court," etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat or in any deed or instrument without first getting approval of the planning commission. Further, the names for all driveways serving more than three buildings must be approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(b)  Unnamed streets. Streets lacking an officially recognized name will have a name selected for them by the planning and zoning commission or its duly appointed agents (limited to either a planning and zoning commission subcommittee or planning staff). 
(c)  Duplicate names. Where more than one street within a postal delivery area is called by the same name (either exact in spelling or phonetically similar), the planning and zoning commission or its duly appointed agents (limited to either a planning and zoning commission subcommittee or planning staff) will select one street to bear that name. All streets left without a name will be treated like other unnamed streets. Whenever streets bearing duplicate names are identified, one street will be selected to retain the name using the following criteria: 
(1)  The street with the greatest number of people living on it will retain the name; 
(2)  Where two or more streets bearing the same name serve approximately the same number of people, the street with the oldest platted (or otherwise recorded) date will retain the name. 
(d)  Procedures for adoption of names. Selected names will be advertised in the newspaper at least 15 days prior to the next monthly planning and zoning commission meeting. This notice will announce the required public hearing to review the street names. Public response to the proposed names will be accepted at that time. Maps showing the location of each street under consideration will be displayed in the city council chambers (or designated place of meeting) prior to the meeting. The maps will also be available for public view at the city planning office from the date of advertisement until final approval. All currently listed street names, at the time of the adoption of this chapter, will be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval to provide a list of officially named streets within the city limits. 
(e)  Renaming streets. To rename a street by request from the public, the following criteria must be met: 
(1)  There must be a minimum of ten residential and/or commercial buildings fronting on said street; 
(2)  A petition signed by three-fourths of the property owners must be submitted with the request for the change of name; 
(3)  The new name cannot duplicate (either exact in spelling or phonetically similar) another street name within a postal delivery area. 
Once the petition to rename a street has been submitted it will be processed by the planning and zoning commission under subsection (d) of this section. 
(f)  Street names which remain unused after assignment. Street names that appear unused after six months of their assignment are subject to a motion for disallowance in the discretion of the planning commission, upon good cause shown in a public hearing. Notice of the motion for disallowance and the hearing date shall be in the same manner as the procedure for adoption of names, and specific notice shall be provided to the original proposer by the planning director. If the commission acts to disallow, the name shall then be available for use by another proposer.

    All buildings within the city limits shall be identified according to a uniform numbering system. All existing buildings not presently in conformity with the provisions of this chapter shall be required to conform to the system (system indicates conformity with either subsection (1) or (2) of this section). All numbers will be designed to function in the Emergency 911 system. The system will function as follows: 
(1)  All new subdivisions, areas annexed into the city and areas within the city which the city council deems necessary by resolution shall be assigned numbers by the planning department on the basis of one number for each 20 feet of frontage along the street. Grid lines as shown on the property numbering map indicate the point at which numbers will change to the next higher multiple of 100 and the range of numbers as indicated on the grid map. 
(2)  All areas numbered prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall remain the same, except where council deems a change is necessary by resolution or where there is a problem with the old number in reference to a uniform system of numbers. The numbers in question shall be brought into compliance within 30 days of the effective date on the written notification. 
(3)  All buildings north of east-west streets and east of north-south streets shall bear even numbers, and all buildings on the south side of east-west streets and west of north-south streets shall bear odd numbers. All streets running more nearly north-south shall be numbered as north-south streets and all streets running more nearly east-west shall be numbered as east-west streets. 
(4)  No unit shall be assigned more than one number. 
(5)  When several buildings have frontage within an assigned frontage area, each building will carry a letter designation such as "A," "B," "C," in addition to the assigned number. 
(6)  No building number shall be issued for a new building until all other requirements for a building permit have been approved and no building permit shall be issued for any principal building until the owner has procured from the planning department the official number of the premises. Final approval for a certificate of occupancy of any principal building erected or repaired after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall be withheld until permanent and proper numbers have been displayed in accordance with the requirements of section 19-114. 
(Code 1980, § 5-8-13) 
Sec. 19-114. - Property owner's responsibility. 
(a)  When each house or building has been assigned its respective number, the owner shall place that number upon each house or building controlled by him/her. 
(b)  Numbers shall be placed on existing buildings within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter or the written notification of a change of building number by the city. 
(c)  The number shall be conspicuously placed in the immediate vicinity of the main door of each building so that the number can be plainly seen from the street from which the address was given. The numbers used shall not be less than four inches in height. The numbers shall be made of a durable and clearly visible material and shall be in a contrasting color from the building. Whenever any building is situated more than 70 feet from the pavement edge or the view of the building is obstructed from the street, the number must be placed near the walk, driveway or common entrance to such building so as to be easily seen from the street line. The cost of the numbers used shall be paid for by the property owner. 
(d)  It shall be the duty of such owner upon affixing the new number to remove any different number which might be mistaken for, or confused with, the number assigned to said building.

ARTICLE VI. - SPECIAL EVENTS, PARADES, FACILITY USE AND PUBLIC PERFORMANCE 
DIVISION 1. - SPECIAL EVENTS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2009-27, § 2, adopted May 12, 2009, amended Art.VI, Div. 1, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, Div. 1, §§ 19-125-19-156, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 19-125. - Purpose; scope and intent. 
(a)  Recognizing that special events such festivals, parades and facility use permits enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike, and to provide substantial economic benefits related to additional tourism, it is the purpose of the city council to establish a structured process for permitting the use of public facilities and the staging of outdoor special events conducted by the private sector to use city streets, facilities or services, or to conduct events that occupy, impact or consume public resources as a result of the congregation of people. This article is intended to insure that the city and its residents and visitors will have adequate advance notice of a proposed festival and the cooperation of the organizers in order properly to plan the city services, such as security, sanitation and traffic control that are required for such an event. It is the intent of the city to promote and encourage events for the greater good and cultural diversity of the city, recognizing that tax-exempt nonprofit organizations benefit the community, and are central to the quality of life. 
(b)  Given the close proximity of residential and commercial areas, the city council must balance the quiet enjoyment of one's residence in relationship to the commercial purposes that sustain and promote our tourist economy. By regulating the special events' frequency, duration, intensity, time, place and manner, the city intends to supplement its land use regulations pertaining to same, and provide a predictable and coordinated process for applicants seeking the exercise of legislative discretion in regards to the grant or denial of a special event permit, and to protect the rights and interests of the holder of the permit and the residents of the city, and to abate the cost of thereof, where the abatement shall be provided regardless of content, message or sponsor in accordance with the terms of this article. The costs to be recouped include, but are not limited to: personnel, equipment and supplies, sanitation (litter, debris and human wastes), wastewater, utilities, park maintenance and restoration, including long-term degradation, and park monitoring. 
(c)  It is the intent of the council to protect the rights of its citizens to engage in protected free speech expressive activities and yet allow for the least restrictive and reasonable, time, place and manner regulation of those activities within the overall context of rationally regulating commercial special events that have an impact upon public facilities and services. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent members of the public from assembling in the parks or streets for the purpose of making any speech or conveying any message to the public or to the government without holding a special event permit or facility use permit pursuant to this article. Should any such persons wish to assemble for such purpose and should they not be holding a permit under this article, they shall not be prevented from doing so, provided that they have complied with any other ordinance or law, if there be any, regulating such other event or gathering, and provided they are peaceable and not in violation of any laws concerning the public order. Persons not holding such a permit under this article, however, will not be entitled to the benefits provided by this article, including but not limited to, the right to erect stages, barricades, utility poles, booths, tents, or other temporary structures, or the use of amplified devices, parked vehicles or of permanent structures, or to the assistance of city personnel in carrying out their event, or their exclusive or reserved use of the facility unless otherwise authorized by some other ordinance or law.

A person or legal entity that, without an approved plan and permit, promotes, stages, conducts, organizes or sponsors a special event or rally that results in an excessive public safety cost is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(b)  The city manager, or his designee is authorized to grant facility use permits and parade permits, and to determine when a proposed facility use rises to the level of a special event permit, based upon an evaluation of public impact or consumption of public resources, location, anticipated attendance, and purpose. Insurance may be required for a facility use permit or parade permit, based upon the risk manager's assessment of potential liability for the city. 
(c)  The city council shall consider all special event permits for events occurring within the city limits of the city pursuant to the procedures established in this division. The council shall determine the special event venue, set reasonable boundaries, balancing the special event requirements and public health, safety, and welfare. 
(1)  No special event permit may be granted for land that is inadequate in any respect for the event(s) or activities as shown by the application, under the totality of the facts and circumstances.

(2)  Except for properties within the defined districts and for district-wide events as determined in the discretion of City Council, no private property may host, in whole or in part, more than five special events in a calendar year, or exceed a cumulative total of ten days of special events in a calendar year. Otherwise, no special event on private property can exceed more than five consecutive days, and no special event on public property can exceed three consecutive days. 
(3)  Within a defined district, no district wide event can exceed more than 90 consecutive days, provided however, these frequency and duration restrictions do not apply when the city council proclaims or declares by resolution a legislative festival or city sponsored event. A business license owner within the special event area may participate under the terms and conditions set forth in the resolution for the length of time so identified without such voluntary participation being counted to reduce their cumulative ten days available for a special event on their private property. In consideration of public safety, sanitation, transportation, and parking, participants in the legislative festival shall submit a site plan for approval pursuant to [section] 19-135 as a condition of participation. 
(4)  A business license holder sponsoring a nonprofit event for charitable purposes is limited to three days. 
(5)  City council reserves the right to limit the proximity or number of concurrent or overlapping special events when the legislative determination is made that city resources are inadequate to meet the demands of the multiple special events, or that the events will result in a concentration of people, vehicles or activity inimical to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(6)  In consideration of current demands on public resources made during the month of May, no special event permit, noise variance, or facility use permit with outdoor vending, merchandise, or food or beverage sales, as otherwise permitted by law, may be issued from May 1 through midnight of May 31 of every year, if such permit or variance overlaps or coincides with an unpermitted rally that is held forth as occurring on specified days and is reasonably perceived by the council acting in its discretion as being held in furtherance of or to take advantage of an unpermitted rally, to include either five days before or five days after the time of the rally as set forth. 
A parking and emergency access plan is required for each special event to address neighboring businesses or residential areas. 
(7)  Reserved.

(9)  Without a shuttle or other visitor transportation system shown in a parking plan, no more than 25 percent of any required parking area may be affected by the placement of buildings during a special event, unless the required parking is provided off site within 300 feet of the boundaries of the venue. At the discretion of the city manager or his designee, temporary parking arrangements may be made to accommodate event participants. Such arrangements may include the use of vacant properties (paved or otherwise), required parking for area businesses during periods when those businesses are closed, or parking for businesses while they are open to the degree that spaces made available for such temporary uses are in excess of required parking for that business. Such temporary parking may be made available for this purpose on either a free or a fee basis. 
(10)  Absent administrative or legislative specific approval, no special event or other permitted event may operate between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(d)  The city shall coordinate the issuance of a special event permit with other public agencies through whose jurisdiction or property the event or portion thereof occurs and to issue a special event permit upon the concurrence of other public agencies involved. The city manager is authorized to establish administrative and operational policies to issue both the special event permit and the facility use permit. 
(e)  On an annual basis, or as requested, the manager shall report a listing of facility use permits, parade permits and special event permits to council. All permits involving the occupation of a public street, except for temporary use of a parade or facility use permit, shall be reviewed by council.

(1)  The manager or designee shall issue a parade permit if no reason for denial exists, and after due consideration of the following factors in light of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained. 
a.  The conduct of the parade should not substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; 
b.  The conduct of the parade should not require the diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the city; 
c.  The conduct of the parade should not require the diversion of so great a number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to portions of the city other than that to be occupied by the proposed line of march and areas contiguous thereto; 
d.  The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly points of the parade should not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of or ambulance service to areas contiguous to the assembly areas;

h.  The applicant for a permit has not violated the terms of any previous parade permit granted to the applicant and has not caused undue traffic congestion and police problems under any previous parade permit. 
(d)  Grounds of denial; notice of denial; appeal. The manager or designee shall deny the application for a parade permit: 
(1)  The person applying for the permit has failed to complete the application, or provide the required insurance protection; 
(2)  The information contained in the application is found to be false in any material respect; 
(3)  An application for another event to be held on the same date as that requested has been previously filed or approved, and the other event is so close in time and location to the event proposed as to cause undue traffic congestion or to place the city in a position of being unable to meet the needs for police, fire, ambulance and public work services for both events; 
(4)  The time, route, or size of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the site or route of the event, or disrupt the use of a street at its peak traffic time, or impede operation of emergency vehicles; 
(5)  The concentration of persons, animals or vehicles at the site of the event or at the site of an assembly or disbanding area around the event will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services reaching areas contiguous to the event; 
(6)  The size of the event will require the diversion of so many city police officers that police protection to the rest of the city will be seriously jeopardized. However, the permit may not be denied because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed; 
(7)  Given the size and nature of the event, the reasonably available number of city police officers and other personnel is not sufficient to ensure the safety of participants or the attending public; 
(8)  The event consists of a parade that will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in four hours or less; 
(9)  The location of the event will substantially interfere with construction or maintenance work previously scheduled to take place on or along the public right-of-way to be occupied by the event; 
(10)  The event will occur at a time when a school is in session and along a route or at a location adjacent to the school or a class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the event will substantially disrupt the educational activity of the school or class; 
(11)  The application is not timely submitted and there is insufficient time to investigate and process the application. 
(12)  The manager or designee shall act upon the application for a parade permit within 30 days after filing thereof. If the application is not approved, notice of denial shall be mailed to the applicant as soon as practicable, but no later than 40 days after the date upon which the application was filed. Such notice will state the reasons for denial of the permit. Any person aggrieved shall have the right to appeal the denial of a parade permit to the city council. The appeal shall be filed no later than 50 calendar days after the date the application was filed. The appeal shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of city council. The decision of the city council to grant or deny that appeal shall constitute the exhaustion of the applicant's administrative remedy. To the extent that council's action is capable of appeal, any further appeal permitted by law shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the council's decision, whether rendered and received orally or in writing.

DIVISION 3. - FACILITY USE 

Sec. 19-161. - Facility use permits. 
(a)  Authority. A request for a reserved use of a public facility, or portion of a public facility for a group function not rising to the level of a special event shall be made to the cultural and leisure department in charge of such facility and in the case of beach use to the police department on a form prescribed and in the manner prescribed by the manager. The fees for the use of facilities shall be established by city council. The facility use permit accomplishes a reservation for a planned function. No person is required to make reservations for use, but no person can exercise event or territorial exclusion as to the general public without a facility use permit. Vendors are permitted. All uses are subject to applicable laws and administrative rules regarding park use. Not all facilities are subject to reservation, and all permits are at the discretion of the city, in consideration of the impact on public property in terms of use frequency, intensity, duration, time and manner; and impact on the general public and neighboring properties on the issue of security, peace and quiet, vehicular movement and parking, and concentration of persons. Beachfront permits are of particular sensitivity. In the Downtown Redevelopment District, upon confirming that no previously issued facility use permit is in conflict from Labor Day weekend to Easter weekend and after providing notice to law enforcement, the Downtown Redevelopment Corporation is permitted to engage in facility use not exceeding four hours for specified areas of Shade Sail Street ends, boardwalk overlooks and lawn areas within the district. 
(b)  Insurance; waiver. A legal entity known as a sole proprietorship, any corporation form, limited liability company, lawfully formed association, or partnership shall provide insurance for its reserved use of the facility. Insurance is required in a form acceptable to the manager from no less than a A-Rated company naming the city as an additional insured under comprehensive general liability insurance coverage be in a combined single limit of at least $1,000,000.00. If the use may constitute a potentially hazardous activity or condition, or if uninsured structures are to be erected, or when some one other than the parent or guardian is providing oversight or supervision of minors, then insurance shall be required regardless of the requesting entity's status. No permit may be issued without the organizer of a special event agreeing to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city from any claim or liability arising from the event. 
(c)  Application; process. In order to allow equal access and appropriate departmental review, an application for a facility use permit shall be filed not less than 15 calendar days, nor more than one year before the time when it is proposed to use the facility. Applications submitted outside these times shall not be considered. 
(d)  Denial; appeal. A facility use permit may be denied upon any of the following grounds: 
(1)  The person applying for the permit has failed to complete the application; 
(2)  The information contained in the application is found to be false in any material respect; 
(3)  An application for another facility use to be held on the same date as that requested has been previously filed or approved; 
(4)  The proposed facility use will interfere with a programmed governmental use of the facility; 
(5)  The location of the proposed use will substantially interfere with construction or maintenance work previously scheduled to take place on or along the public right-of-way adjacent to the facility. 
(6)  The application is not timely submitted and there is insufficient time to investigate and process the application. 
The manager or designee shall act upon the application for a facility use permit within 30 days after filing thereof. If the application is not approved, notice of denial shall be mailed to the applicant as soon as practicable, but no later than 40 days after the date upon which the application was filed. Such notice will state the reasons for denial of the permit. Any person aggrieved shall have the right to appeal the denial of a facility use permit to the city council. The appeal shall be filed no later than 50 calendar days after the date upon which the application was filed. The appeal shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of city council. The decision of the city council to grant or deny that appeal shall constitute the exhaustion of the applicant's administrative remedy. To the extent that council's action is capable of appeal, any further appeal permitted by law shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the council's decision, whether rendered and received orally or in writing.

ARTICLE VII. - TRAFFIC CONGESTION MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 19-200. - Factual and policy findings by city council. 
    Whereas, based upon the input of the planning commission's work on corridor studies, resident's complaints, the advice of law enforcement and the administration, and upon its own collective knowledge of traffic issues in the city; and being further based upon the submittal and roadway classification system of the city engineer, the city council finds that: Recurring and incident/nonrecurring congestion dramatically impact and disrupt normal functional operation of the transportation system as a result of increased travel demand and/or decrease in roadway capacity. The existence of congestion traffic is inimical to public health, safety and welfare. The purpose of congestion traffic management is to reduce the intensity of motor vehicle use during peak hour congestion, thereby easing gridlock in movement and encouraging commuters to take alternate routes, walk, bicycle or take mass transit as an alternative. Because of its narrow and linear shape, the city uniquely has roads with characteristics that blend into separate classifications, that require a unique approach to congestion mitigation. The goals of mitigation are to relieve congestion in less intense areas that have become overburdened, and to distribute motor vehicle traffic within the roadway system of classifications. This will allow the congestion points to ease, particularly in impacted arterial, collector and local roads, and will reduce delays and motorist frustration over traffic which seemingly does not move when traffic volume would elevate a road into the next category of intensity of use, beyond its geometric design or demand capacity. Reduced congestion will benefit those who continue to drive, in the form of faster, more predictable commutes. Essential trips, particularly emergency vehicles, delivery vehicles and small business owners, will become less susceptible to traffic-related delays. Management will improve our city's air quality, and protect our quality of life by reducing congestion at certain critical roadway segments, promoting managed movement of vehicles, and more fairly allow citizens and visitors alike to utilize key transportation corridors. This article in no way limits law enforcement officer's discretion in emergency or exigent circumstances to take such action as is prudent to protect the public's health, safety or welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 5-12-09) 
Sec. 19-201. - Definitions. 
    Congestion traffic is a condition of oversaturation or increasing intense use on public roads systems when traffic demands exceed roadway capacity. Oversaturation exists where roadway demand exceeds capacity such that significant vehicle queuing exists which can also be characterized as gridlock and where greater vehicular density, and close vehicle spacing results in little to no movement when more than one lane is available and/or where little to no entry or exist from the travel lane exists with little to no forward movement. In essence it is the difference between the street network system performance that is in place, and what users expect and how the system actually performs, or degrades in performance under certain conditions. For purposes of this article, congestion traffic is either recurring or incident/nonrecurring in origin. 
    Incident/nonrecurring traffic congestion is caused by specific random traffic incidents, planned or unplanned special events, weather conditions, work zones and emergency events. These incidents or nonrecurring events dramatically reduce the level of service and reliability of the entire transportation system. Incident traffic congestion dramatically impacts overall area-wide and city-wide commuter health and safety, vehicular and pedestrian mobility, and travel time reliability for visitors and residents alike. Incident traffic congestion requires aggressive applications and management to reduce the impacts of these disruptions and return the system to normal operation and full capacity. 
    Planned or unplanned special events, for the purposes of this article, include outdoor sporting events, concerts, festivals, fireworks displays and conventions occurring at permanent multi-use venues (e.g., arenas, stadiums, racetracks, fairgrounds, amphitheaters, convention centers, etc.). They also include less frequent public events such as parades, bicycle races, marathons, seasonal festivals and milestone celebrations at temporary venues that involve the use of the public way, and also include sporadic or cyclical events such as automobile or motorcycle rallies, which are a gathering of riders, drivers and enthusiasts scheduled and sponsored by specific clubs, associations, event planners and/or organizers, event promoters, vendors, dealers or vendor permit sellers for the purpose of retail sales to attendees, who expect and are provided a variety of vending opportunities and entertainment events by those who profit from the gathering. The term special event is not used to denote the perceived quality of the event, or to imply that one entity is necessarily in charge of organizing or managing the event but is used to describe these types of activities because of their known shared characteristics of widespread promotion by those seeking profit, with a location identified as the place of gathering or rally, with a published or publicly known time of occurrence, either sporadic, cyclical or scheduled. The resulting congestion can be attributed to event promotion or staging, or lack of planning or control by event promoters or organizers. Planned or unplanned special events can dramatically impact overall travel safety, vehicular and pedestrian mobility, and travel time reliability for visitors and residents alike. It is anticipated that those events that seek and obtain a special events permits shall have a traffic component that address anticipated congestion traffic. However, should the plan prove inadequate, law enforcement has the flexibility to implement traffic congestion counter measures, including but not limited to those measure contained herein. 
    Recurring traffic congestion is caused by inadequacies in roadway capacity demanded for the greater number of vehicles normally in peak travel periods. Mitigation of recurring congestion includes the development and deployment of traffic control, the addition of roadway capacity and/or and travel demand management strategies designed to improve operation and/or safety on congested highway facilities during peak travel periods. Recurring congestion is experienced virtually every day. This is the type of congestion where there are simply more vehicles than roadway at known times. 
    Road classification means the categorizing of roadways into different operational systems, functional classes or geometric types and features. The comprehensive plan uses a roadway classification system that contains both current applications, as well as long range planning. The city engineer congestion traffic management counter measures shall only exist while the congestion conditions exist in the identified area. The city engineer is responsible for the current state of classification for the purposes of this article. 
    Queuing means a closely spaced collection of vehicles. 
    Traffic incidents mean traffic slowdowns due to emergency response, natural events such as smoke producing fires of vehicles, land or dwellings, vehicle crashes, pedestrian interference with vehicular movement, or disabled or stalled vehicles or debris on the road. 
    Weather conditions mean precipitation, fog or wind elements affecting a driver or a roadway. 
    Work zones mean any area impacted by an event of right of way construction or maintenance performed under governmental control or contract.

Sec. 19-202. - Incident/nonrecurring congestion traffic management. 
(a)  Generally. Traffic management of incident/nonrecurring traffic congestion involves direct observation of the affected roadway system, and the aggressive implementation of identified counter measures. 
(b)  Incident/nonrecurring congestion traffic management counter measures. Upon the roadway system as herein classified, traffic management of incident/nonrecurring traffic congestion is made necessary upon law enforcement observation of the existence of significant disruption to the public safety of an overburdened roadway segment, or the existence of congestion that acts to dramatically impact and disrupt normal functional operation of the transportation system, as a result of increased travel demand and/or decrease in roadway capacity. Upon law enforcement confirmation and fulfillment of the conditions set forth herein, and upon implementation of adopted police department policies and procedures, all private vehicles that enter the city limits of Myrtle Beach will be subject to congestion traffic management counter measures, and such counter measures shall constitute the lawful instructions of an official traffic control measure, including individual law enforcement directives, placement of barriers, devices, signs, signals or markings by the city, whether manually, electrically or mechanically operated. Congestion traffic management counter measures shall only exist while the congestion conditions exist in the identified area. Counter measures shall not apply to public safety, public works or emergency vehicles. Upon law enforcement confirmation of congestion traffic as set forth herein, the approved options of counter measures may be implemented by the manager, or his designee in such order or combination in their discretion that will ease congestion and preserve public safety, health and welfare. The congestion traffic management counter measure shall include, singly or any combination: 
(1)  Compelled, immediate, protracted or intermittent diversion from the congested segments; 
(2)  Temporary closure of travel lane(s) until the congested condition in the identified segment is eased; 
(3)  Compelled use of alternate routes to their desired locations; 
(4)  Temporary and timed closure of traffic corridors to all vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 2009-14, 5-12-09) 
Sec. 19-203. - Recurring congestion traffic management. 
(a)  Generally. Traffic management of recurring traffic congestion involves long range planning and strategies in the capital improvements area, and more immediate implementation of counter measures. 
(b)  Recurring congestion traffic management counter measures. Upon the roadway system as herein classified, traffic management of recurring traffic congestion is made necessary upon law enforcement observation of the existence of significant disruption to the public safety of an overburdened roadway segment, or the existence of congestion traffic that acts to dramatically impact and disrupt normal functional operation of the transportation system, as a result of increased travel demand and/or decrease in roadway capacity. Upon law enforcement confirmation and fulfillment of the conditions set forth herein, and upon implementation of adopted police department policies and procedures, all private vehicles that enter the city limits of Myrtle Beach will be subject to congestion traffic management counter measures, and such counter measures shall constitute the lawful instructions of an official traffic control measure, including individual law enforcement directives, placement of barriers, devices, signs, signals or markings by the city, whether manually, electrically or mechanically operated. Congestion traffic management counter measures shall only exist while the congestion conditions exist in the identified area. Counter measures shall not apply to public safety, public works or emergency vehicles. Upon law enforcement confirmation of congestion traffic as set forth herein, the approved options of counter measures may be implemented by the manager, or his designee in such order or combination in their discretion that will ease congestion and preserve public safety, health and welfare. Recurring traffic management counter measures shall include: 
(1)  If and when permitted by the State of South Carolina, enhanced arterial management consisting of traffic signal operations, management, maintenance and timing; and road/lane access management; or 
(2)  Future institution of real time traffic information systems for drivers, enhanced roadway performance and/or additional infrastructure; or 
(3)  Development of law enforcement traffic incident management protocol; or 
(4)  One or more counter measures for incident/nonrecurring traffic congestion, when applicable. Congestion traffic management counter measures shall only exist while the congestion conditions exist in the identified area.

ARTICLE V. - VESTED PROPERTY RIGHTS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2005-39, §§ 7.1-7.7, 7.10, 7.11, adopted June 28, 2005, amended the Code by adding provisions that were not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, said provisions have been included herein as §§ 20-71-20-79. 

Sec. 20-71. - Legislative findings. 
    As an incident to the adoption of this article, the city council, as the governing body of the city, makes the following findings: 
(1)  The South Carolina General Assembly has enacted the "Vested Rights Act", which is codified as S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-1520 et seq., as amended, (the "Act"). 
(2)  The Act requires local governments to enact land development ordinances and regulations implementing the provisions of the Vested Rights Act on or before July 1, 2005. The Act authorizes local governments to establish a procedure for the vesting of rights in certain development plans, and provides that local governments that do not pass land development ordinances and/or ordinances implementing a procedure for the establishment of vested rights will be subject to the requirements of S.C. Code § 6-29-1560 of the Act, under which a landowner has a vested right to proceed in accordance with an approved site specific development plan upon the terms and conditions and subject to the requirements and limitations of S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-1560(A), which section substitutes statutory conditions for vesting, thereby reducing local control and flexibility. 
(3)  Council finds that the Code of Laws of the City of Myrtle Beach, chapter 20, Subdivision Regulations should be amended by enacting article V to conform to the requirements of the Vested Rights Act; facilitate the administration of zoning and land use codes, ordinances and regulations; provide a fair and equitable process and procedure for the administration of county codes, ordinances and regulations; and promote the public health, safety, order, appearance, prosperity and general welfare.

(5)  A vested right established in accordance with the provisions of this article shall be vested upon approval by the city of the site specific development plan or specific phase of a phased development plan that authorizes the developer or landowner to proceed with investment in grading, installation of utilities, streets and other infrastructure and to undertake other specific expenditures necessary to prepare for application for a building permit. No developer or landowner shall proceed with investment in grading, installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or shall undertake other significant expenditures necessary to prepare for application for a building permit before a site specific development plan or phased development plan or phase thereof authorizing such improvements and expenditures has been approved by the city. No investment in grading, installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or other significant expenditures shall give rise to or establish a vested right until the city has approved the site specific development plan or phased development plan or phase thereof that authorizes the developer or landowner to proceed with improvements or undertake other significant expenditures on the real property which is proposed for development. 
(b)  A site specific development plan for which a variance, regulation or special exception is necessary, does not qualify and may not claim or receive vested right status unless and until the variance, regulation or special exception is obtained and the site specific development plan has been approved without conditions or exceptions. A phased development plan for which a variance, regulation or special exception is necessary does not qualify and may not obtain a vested right until the variance, regulation or special exception is obtained and the phase of the phased development plan has been approved without condition or exception. 
(c)  A vested right for a site specific development plan expires two years after vesting; provided, however, that the landowner of real property with a vested right may apply to the city before the end of the vesting period or within 30 days after the expiration of the vesting period or any extension thereof, but not thereafter, for an annual extension of the vested right for a period of one year. If a timely and proper written application is made, the city must approve applications for no more than five successive annual extensions unless an amendment to land development ordinances or regulations has been adopted that prohibits approval of such annual extension applications. The city shall designate the vesting point for a phased development plan as the date of approval of each phase of the phased development plan. The city may extend the time for a vested site specific development plan to a total of five years upon a determination that there is just cause for the extension and that the public interest is not adversely affected. Upon expiration of a vested right, a building permit may be issued for development only in accordance with applicable land development ordinances and regulations then applicable.

The issuance of a building permit vests the specific construction project authorized by the building permit to the building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes in force at the time of the issuance of the building permit. 
(h)  A vested site specific development plan or vested phased development plan or phase thereof is subject to later local governmental overlay zoning that imposes site plan-related requirements but does not affect allowable types, height as it affects density or intensity of uses or density or intensity of uses.

(Ord. No. 98-31, § 3, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-4. - Application process. 
(a)  Any telecommunications provider seeking to provide telecommunications service or utilize city streets (the "applicant") shall complete a brief application form approved by the department of public works. Such application form shall briefly describe the general nature of the service to be provided, the type of construction or use of facilities required, the name, address, and telephone number of the person or entity seeking to provide the service, and the name, address, and telephone number of an authorized representative of the person or entity. 
(b)  The applicant shall also provide evidence in a form satisfactory to the city that it has the financial, legal, and technical qualifications necessary to provide the service for which it seeks a franchise, and that all required federal and state certifications have been applied for or granted. Certification by the South Carolina Public Service Commission shall be sufficient evidence of such qualifications. 
(c)  In considering whether to grant consent or a franchise or to impose terms and conditions on the grant of consent or a franchise, the city may consider, without limitation, the following factors: 
(1)  The applicant's receipt of all required state and federal authorizations; 
(2)  The capacity of the streets to accommodate the applicant's proposed facilities; 
(3)  The damage or disruption, if any, of public or private facilities, improvements, or landscaping if a franchise or license is granted; 
(4)  The effect on public health, safety, or welfare if consent or a franchise is granted; 
(5)  The availability of alternate routes and locations for the proposed facilities; 
(6)  Whether the imposition of certain terms and conditions or the failure to grant the requested consent or a franchise would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of the Applicant to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications services; and 
(7)  Any other factor relating to whether the grant of consent or a franchise impinges on the city's right to manage its streets. 
(d)  An applicant for consent or a franchise shall submit with its application a fee in the amount of $1,000.00 in partial compensation to the city for processing the application. 
(e)  If the city approves the application, the provider shall reimburse the city for any reasonable costs and expenses in excess of the fee specified in subsection (d), above, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the city to review and evaluate the application and prepare and negotiate a consent agreement or franchise agreement with the provider, including the costs of any publication as provided in section 20.5-5.

(Ord. No. 98-31, § 5, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-6. - Construction and maintenance. 
(a)  Application. Prior to beginning construction of any telecommunications facility, including any curb cut or pavement cut, the applicant shall obtain permission from the department of public works of the city to carry out construction activities in the city's streets, and shall comply with all requirements of that department or any other ordinance or code applicable hereto. 
(b)  Construction plan. Prior to beginning construction, the applicant shall submit a plan describing the proposed construction. The plan shall specify: 
(1)  The design of any telecommunications facilities to be constructed or utilized; 
(2)  A map showing the precise location of any telecommunications facility to be constructed or utilized and any appurtenant facilities such as poles, attachments, guy wires, and the like; 
(3)  The timetable for completion of construction, including any phases of construction; 
(4)  Such other information as will provide the city with pertinent information relating to the construction of the telecommunications facilities, including any pertinent information requested by the city. 
(c)  Prior authority. Prior to beginning construction, the applicant shall have received all necessary regulatory authority to construct a telecommunications facility or provide telecommunications service from the South Carolina Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other appropriate state or federal agency. Evidence that it has received such regulatory authority, or that such authority is not required, shall be filed with the city. 
(d)  Standards of construction. The method of construction, workmanship used, and materials utilized in the construction shall conform to all applicable federal, state, and local statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances. All work shall be performed in a safe, thorough, and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality so as not to create a hazard or dangerous condition on the streets. If, at any time, it is determined by the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any telecommunications facility presents a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, then the telecommunications provider shall, at its own cost and expense, after reasonable notice from the city, promptly correct all such conditions. 
(e)  Maintenance and repair. Any telecommunications facility constructed or utilized pursuant to a consent agreement or franchise agreement shall be maintained and repaired in accordance with the standards and under the terms and conditions set out in the preceding paragraph and such other terms and conditions as shall appear in this chapter or the agreement. 
(f)  Minimal disruption. Construction, maintenance and repair of the telecommunications facilities shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize any interference with or disruption of the city's streets, traffic, residences, businesses and institutions. Where underground construction is required by subsection (i), below, the provider shall be obligated to use trenchless technology in appropriate circumstances as determined by the city's director of public works. 
(g)  Restoration. Any disturbance of the city's streets shall be repaired and restored by the telecommunications provider at its expense to a condition as good as that prevailing before the work causing such disturbance was commenced. If at any time the city determines that any restoration performed by the provider is deficient to the extent that it poses a threat to the safety of the public, the city shall have the right to undertake emergency repairs or other protective actions as may in its opinion be necessary and the provider shall reimburse the city for all costs of such repair or other actions. If any restoration performed by the telecommunications provider does not comply with the standards established in this section, the city may, after ten days written notice to the provider, perform necessary repairs to bring the restoration up to such standards and the provider shall reimburse the city for all costs of such repair. 
(h)  Location of facilities. Poles and other facilities shall be located to the extent feasible in such a way as to minimize their effect on the visual landscape and on other aesthetic considerations and so as to minimize inconvenience. 
(i)  Burial of facilities. It is the intent of city council that all utility facilities, including all telecommunications facilities, be underground in all areas of the city as quickly as is technically and economically feasible. All providers who enter into a franchise agreement or consent agreement with the city shall acknowledge that they will be required to place all facilities underground at their own expense upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately in any area of the city where all existing electric, telephone, and cable television lines are currently underground or where such lines are scheduled to be placed underground within one year. 
(2)  Within three years after the expiration, earlier termination, or material amendment of the existing electric franchise granted to the South Carolina Public Service Commission (Santee Cooper). The Santee Cooper franchise will expire under its terms on June 30, 2005. 
(3)  At such time as the city requires all holders of existing telephone, electric, and cable franchises or consent agreements to place their facilities underground. If the city establishes the requirement in a specific area of the city this provision shall apply to all facilities in that area. If the city establishes this requirement city-wide it shall apply to all providers city-wide. 
(4)  During the pendency of any litigation which may be brought by a competitor that has the effect of delaying the placement of that competitor's facilities underground, a provider may elect, at its own risk, to install above ground facilities within any area subject to the litigation, but will be required to place its facilities underground at its own expense upon a final determination of the litigation that upholds the requirement to place the facilities underground. 
In extreme circumstances city council may, by ordinance, grant permission for the installation of limited aboveground facilities if council finds that underground installation would be technically impractical or cause extreme economic hardship. In all cases similarly impacted providers shall be treated similarly. 
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or discourage agreements between providers and the city to provide incentives for the placement of facilities underground earlier than herein provided. 
(j)  Co-location; sharing of pole space and conduits. To the maximum extent feasible, a telecommunications provider constructing a new transmission line or other facility, or expanding an existing line or facility, shall utilize existing pole space or conduit facilities. The owner of any existing facility shall to the extent permitted by law and consistent with any pole attachment regulations of the public service commission, the Federal Communications Commission or other appropriate agency, permit the telecommunications provider to utilize its poles or conduits. 
(k)  Movement of facilities. A telecommunications provider shall be required to temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its facilities at its own expense when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; or the construction, installation or repair of any public road, highway, building, park or other public project. The provider shall cooperate with any other public utility authorized by the city to provide utility service utilizing the city's streets. To the extent any removal or relocation is required for the benefit of any party other than the city, the provider may require payment of the actual cost of the removal or relocation by the benefitted party. 
(l)  Tree trimming. The zoning ordinance of the city provides that an annual permit may be issued to a provider exempting the provider from the provisions of the city's tree protection ordinance, but requires that the provider shall nevertheless conform its tree-trimming practices to the 1995 ANSI A300 Standards. The provider shall give the city zoning administrator 24-hours notice prior to undertaking any tree trimming. The zoning administrator may choose to observe any tree trimming performed by a provider and, if the required standards are not complied with, take all necessary enforcement action the administrator determines to be appropriate pursuant to the zoning ordinance. In the event a provider is found to have repeatedly violated the required standards in performing tree trimming, the city may also pursue any of the remedies in sections 20.5-17 and 20.5-18. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § 6, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-7. - Performance bond. 
(a)  Prior to the start of construction, the provider shall post a performance bond, satisfactory to the city, in the city's favor, to ensure faithful performance of the terms and provisions of the consent agreement or franchise agreement and any approved construction plan filed with the city pursuant to subsection 20.5-6(b). The bond shall be equivalent to ten percent of the total cost of the construction as provided in the construction plan. 
(b)  In the event the provider fails to comply with this chapter or the franchise agreement, or to complete the construction in a safe, timely, and competent manner, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, the city may recover, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the provider, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § 7, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-8. - Term of franchise for providers. 
    A franchise agreement shall be for a term not exceeding ten years. In determining the term of a franchise, it is the intent of the city that the term be established so that all telecommunications franchises shall expire on approximately the same date. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § 8, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-9. - Fees. 
(a)  Amount. In consideration of the city's grant of authority to utilize the city's streets for the provision of telecommunications services and for other good and valuable consideration, the telecommunications provider shall pay a franchise fee to the city in the following amounts: 
(1)  A telecommunications provider who provides service to residents, businesses or institutions in the city shall pay one percent of its annual gross revenues derived from its provision of telecommunications service in the city. Payment of this franchise fee is in addition to any business license tax that the provider is required to pay for the privilege of conducting business in the city. 
(2)  A telecommunications provider who provides service solely to persons outside the geographic boundaries of the city by utilizing a transmission line shall pay the city a reasonable annual fee based upon an installation fee and a charge per linear foot of transmission line that traverses the city's rights-of-way or based upon such other method as the city deems appropriate. Such fee and the method of payment shall be established in the consent agreement. 
(b)  Time of payment. All fees due and owing shall be paid on a biannual basis on or before August 15 of each year for the first six months of the calendar year and on or before February 15 of each year for the second six months of the preceding calendar year.

(d)  Calculation of payments. All payments made to the city shall be accompanied by a statement certified as true by an appropriate employee of the provider or lessee explaining the basis of the calculation on which the payment was made. 
(e)  Payments. Payments shall be made by certified check to the City of Myrtle Beach, c/o City Finance Director, P.O. Box 2468, 937 Broadway/City Hall, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina 29578-2468 or by wire transfer to an account of the city designated in writing by the city finance director.

(g)  Audit.

Such records shall not include any records relating to the existence or content of communications of the provider's customers which are protected from disclosure by federal or state law. A telecommunications provider shall maintain sufficient financial records governing its operation in the city to allow the determination of gross revenues and to otherwise document accurate payment of fees. To the extent permitted under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act, the city shall maintain the confidentiality of such records. 
(h)  Fees not a tax. The fees provided in this section are not taxes and are separate from, and in addition to, any and all federal, state, local, and city taxes as may be levied, imposed, or due from a telecommunications provider or lessee, its customers or subscribers, or on account of the lease, sale, delivery, or transmission of telecommunications services; provided that no fee imposed by this section shall be imposed in violation of state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § 9, 6-23-98) 
Sec. 20.5-10. - Indemnification. 
(a)  As a condition of the grant of consent or a franchise, the telecommunications provider shall agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents, and employees (collectively the "indemnified parties") from and against any and all lawsuits, claims, causes of action, actions, liabilities, demands, damages, judgments, settlements, disability, losses, expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements of counsel) and costs of any nature that any of the indemnified parties may at any time suffer, sustain or incur arising out of, based upon, or in any way connected with the provider's operations, the exercise of the consent or franchise herein granted or the breach by the provider of its obligations under this chapter and the consent agreement or franchise agreement or based upon or in any way connected with the activities of the provider, or their subcontractors, employees, and agents.

(c)  The city does not, and shall not, waive any rights against the provider which it may have by reason of the indemnification provided for in this chapter because of the acceptance by the city, or the deposit with the city by provider, of any of the insurance policies described in this chapter. 
(d)  The indemnification of the city by a provider provided for in this chapter shall apply to all damages and claims for damages of any kind suffered by reason of any of the provider's operations referred to in this chapter regardless of whether or not such insurance policies shall have been determined to be applicable to any such damages or claims for damages. 
(e)  A provider shall not be required to indemnify the city for negligence or misconduct on the part of the city or its officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees, provided that the provider shall be responsible for its proportionate share of any damages or claims resulting from any negligent act or omission.

ARTICLE IV. - INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT PROGRAM 

Sec. 21-76. - Introduction. 
(a)  The General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution (40 CFR 403), as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June 1978, outlines the regulations for a pretreatment program. The EPA delegated to the state department of health and environmental control the administration and enforcement authority for the state pretreatment program. 
(b)  The objectives of the pretreatment program are to: 
(1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works (POTW) which will interfere with plant operations and/or the disposal or use of municipal sludge. 
(2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into a POTW which will pass through the treatment works or be incompatible with the POTW. 
(3)  Improve opportunities to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludges. 
(4)  Enforce applicable EPA categorical standards. 
(5)  Provide for equitable distribution of the cost for treatment of waste discharged to the POTW. 
(c)  The state pretreatment program is divided into two phases. Phase I deals primarily with an evaluation of the existing situation at a POTW. Phase IA consists of surveying the nondomestic dischargers and evaluating the type, volume and strength of the discharged waste to the POTW. Phases IA and IB of the pretreatment program for the city was submitted in June 1989 to the state department of health and environmental control. The state department of health and environmental control advised that a complete pretreatment program would be required for the city POTW. 
(d)  This report addressed the development of the pretreatment program that will be implemented by the city and fulfills phase II of the state pretreatment program. Phase II concerns the organization, staffing, funding and adoption of ordinances that are needed to implement the pretreatment program. 
(e)  Composite sampling was conducted on the influent and effluent of the city wastewater treatment facility and one major industrial discharger. No excessive amounts of substances could be found in the plant influent that would be detrimental to treatment plant performance. Historically, the wastewater treatment facility is well within the NPDES permit limits for BOD and TSS. Very low concentrations of metals were present in both the waste treatment plant influent and effluent. 
(f)  Sampling of the major dischargers to the system was undertaken to determine the characteristics of their discharges. The results of the sample analyses are available for review at the city engineering and public services department. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-0, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-77. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abnormal industrial wastes means any industrial waste having a suspended solids or BOD content in excess of that normally found in municipal sewage. For the purposes of this article, any waste containing more than 250 mg/l of suspended solids or having a BOD in excess of 250 mg/l shall be deemed an abnormal industrial waste regardless of whether or not it contains other substances in concentration differing appreciably from those normally found in municipal sewage. 
    Abnormal wastewater means the same as "abnormal industrial wastes" except it may originate from a nonindustrial customer. 
    Approving authority means the director of public services and engineering of the city. 
    BOD means the quantity of oxygen utilized in biochemical oxidation of the organic matter of sewage or industrial wastes under standard laboratory procedures in five days at 20 degrees Celsius, expressed in milligrams per liter. It shall be determined by the methods specified in 40 CFR 136. 
    Building sewer means the extension from the building drain to the public sewer or other place of disposal, also called house connection. 
    C means Celsius degrees. 
    Chain of custody means a permanent record identifying who took the sample, who transported it, and to whom the sample was delivered for analysis, along with the time and dates of such transactions. 
    Composite sample means:

(2)  A combination of not less than eight influent or effluent grab samples collected at regular, equal intervals over a specified period of time, properly preserved, and composited by increasing the volume of each aliquot in proportion to flow. If continuous flow measurement is not used to composite in proportion to flow, the following method will be used: Take an instantaneous flow measurement each time a grab sample is collected. At the end of the sampling period, sum the instantaneous flow measurements to obtain a total flow to determine the partial amount (percentage) of each grab sample to be combined to obtain the composite sample. 
(3)  A combination of not less than eight influent or effluent grab samples of equal volume but at variable time intervals that are inversely proportional to the volume of the flow. That is, the time interval between aliquots is reduced as the volume of flow increases. 
(4)  A combination of not less than eight influent or effluent grab samples or constant, equal volume collected at regular, equal time intervals over a specified period of time, while being properly preserved. 
Continuous flow or the sum of instantaneous flows measured and averaged for the specified compositing time period shall be used with composite sample results to calculate quantity. 
    Control manhole means a manhole giving access to a building sewer at some point before the building sewer discharges and mixes with other discharges in the public sewer. 
    Cooling water means the water discharged from any use such as air conditioning, cooling or refrigeration, during which the only pollutant added to the water is heat. 
    County shall mean Horry County or any agency or department thereof.

    EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
    Garbage means animal and vegetable wastes and residue from preparation, cooking and dispensing of food; and from the handling, processing, storage and sale of food. 
    Grab sample means an individual discrete or single influent or effluent portion of at least 100 milliliters collected at a time representative of the discharge and over a period not exceeding 15 minutes and retained separately for analysis. Instantaneous flow measured at the time of grab sample collection shall be used to calculate quantity. 
    Grease means fat, oils, waxes and other related constituents found in wastewater. 
    Industrial wastewater means the liquid discharged as a result of the processes employed in industrial establishments or which exceeds the concentrations of normal municipal wastewater. 
    Infiltration/inflow and/or unpolluted wastewater means extraneous water including, but not limited to, groundwater, stormwater, surface water, pool drains, cooling water or other waters or wastes, which do not originate from an approved domestic or industrial wastewater connection. 
    May is permissive; "shall" is mandatory.

Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 21-78. - Procedures for approving pretreatment systems. 
    All pretreatment systems, including equalization basins, must be permitted by the industrial wastewater division of the state department of health and environmental control before they are constructed. The POTW shall review the proposed pretreatment system to ensure that the monitoring or sampling points are acceptable and the proposed system will be compatible with their pretreatment program requirement before forwarding the plans to the state department of health and environmental control for review. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-2, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-79. - Procedures for developing discharge limits. 
(a)  After evaluating the results of the nondomestic waste survey and the results of any sampling that was completed, the POTW will establish discharge limits for any pollutants that should be controlled. When developing the discharge limits, the following shall be taken into consideration: 
(1)  Categorical limits. These are established as federal requirements. The POTW cannot establish limits that are less stringent than these requirements but can establish more stringent limits. 
(2)  Hazardous waste management regulations. If the sewage sludge solids are to be disposed of as a nonhazardous waste, the sludge solids must be nontoxic, not ignitable, nonreactive, and noncorrosive. If the sewage sludge solids contain any of the materials in Appendix IV of the Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, they may be designated as hazardous wastes and will be required to be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill. Appendix IV of the Hazardous Waste Management Regulations and additional information concerning the parameters that the POTW should analyze for in the sewage sludge solids are available for review at the department of engineering and public services. 
(3)  Drinking water standards. If a pollutant is passing through the wastewater treatment plant but is not a categorical pollutant, a limit for that pollutant shall be established to prevent the concentration of that pollutant in the receiving stream from exceeding the drinking water standard for that pollutant. 
(4)  Construction permit limits. These are limits that shall be established as a condition for a nondomestic discharger to obtain from the state department of health and environmental control a permit to construct a pretreatment system. 
(5)  Water quality standards. These are limits for pollutants to prevent an impact on the aquatic life in the receiving stream. These limits may be found in the EPA publication Quality Criteria For Water. 
(6)  NPDES limits. These are limits for the discharge from the POTW and are set by the state department of health and environmental control and the EPA. 
(7)  Operation and maintenance considerations. The POTW may find it necessary to impose a limit on a substance if it is causing interference in the treatment process or if it threatens the physical structure of the collection and treatment system. Examples of a substance that must need to be regulated are as follows: 
a.  Substances with a pH lower than 5.0 or which will cause corrosive damage to any part of the collection and treatment system. 
b.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause an obstruction to the flow in the collection system or interference in the treatment plant. 
c.  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
d.  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
e.  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
f.  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW. 
(8)  Health and safety consideration. These are limits that may be needed to protect the health and safety of the operators or maintenance workers. 
(9)  POTW considerations. Any unique situation where a POTW may establish discharge limits for a reason other than the above. 
(10)  Dilution. The limits should specifically prohibit dilution of the discharge. Mass limits in pounds/day should be established for each pollutant to be regulated. 
(b)  Procedure for developing a discharge limit for a contaminant shall include these steps: 
(1)  Determine the amount of the contaminant that enters the treatment plant and leaves the POTW in the effluent or the sewage sludge solids. 
(2)  Establish the maximum amount of the contaminant that can enter the wastewater collection and treatment system without violating the NPDES permit, interfering with approved sludge disposal, interfering with any of the treatment processes, endangering the physical structures of the collection and treatment system or endangering POTW personnel or the public health and safety. 
(3)  Determine the amount of the contaminant that may be present in the normal domestic sewage. 
(4)  Establish a safety factor for future growth in the community in the form of additional domestic dischargers and nondomestic dischargers. 
(5)  Subtract the amount of the contaminant contributed by the domestic dischargers and the amount saved for the safety factor from the maximum amount that can enter the wastewater treatment plant. 
(6)  Distribute the remaining amount of the contaminant equitably among the nondomestic dischargers that discharge the contaminants to the POTW. 
For a more detailed explanation of these steps, see Appendix D, available for inspection at the office of the department of engineering and public services. 
(c)  Once the pretreatment limits are proposed by the POTW, the nondomestic dischargers shall be advised of the proposed limits. This shall take the form of a written notification explaining the proposed limits and offering the discharger an opportunity to respond. When the affected dischargers are notified of the proposed limits, the POTW should also provide individual notification of the proposed limits to all interested persons or groups who have requested such notification. A public notice of the intent to adopt the proposed limits should be published in the local newspaper and an opportunity for the discharger or interested parties to respond must be provided. A public hearing is not required but there must be a procedure for receiving written or verbal comments. The procedure for developing the pretreatment limits and notifying the affected dischargers and interested individuals or groups will be followed each time a new standard or set of standards is established for a discharger or group of dischargers. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-3, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-80. - Prohibition and limitations on wastewater discharge.

(4)  Improperly shredded garbage. Garbage that has not been ground or commingled to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely in suspension under flow conditions normally prevailing in the public sewers. 
(5)  Radioactive wastes. Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration that they are in noncompliance with regulations issued by the appropriate authority having control over their use and which will or may cause damage or hazards to the sewerage facilities or personnel operating the system. 
(6)  Solid or viscous waste. Solid or viscous wastes which will or may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewerage facilities. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, grease, uncombined garbage, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent limestone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastic, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, and similar substances. 
(7)  Excessive discharge rate. Wastewaters at a flow rate which is excessive relative to the capacity of the treatment works and which would cause a treatment process upset and subsequent loss of treatment efficiency; or wastewaters containing such concentrations or quantities of pollutants that their introduction into the treatment works over a relatively short time period, sometimes referred to as slug discharges, would cause a treatment process upset and subsequent loss of treatment efficiency. 
(8)  Heavy metals and toxic substances materials. No heavy metals or toxic materials shall be discharged into public sewers without a written permit from the city specifying conditions of pretreatment, concentrations, volumes and other applicable provisions. In addition, no metallic or toxic substance which may interfere with the biological processes or efficiency of the collection, transmission, treatment and disposal facilities of the city shall be discharged to the public sewer. 
(9)  Unpolluted wastewaters. Any unpolluted wastewater which will increase the hydraulic load on the sewerage facilities. 
(10)  Discolored materials. Wastes with objectionable color not removable by the treatment process. 
(11)  Corrosive wastes. Any waste which will cause corrosion or deterioration of the sewerage facilities. All wastes discharged to the public sewer system must have a pH value in the range of 6 to 9.

(12)  Abnormal industrial waste. As defined in section 21-77. 
(13)  Heat. No person shall discharge heated waste of any nature that may interfere with the proper operation of the sewerage facilities. Heat shall be deferred in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8 as presently existing or as may be amended in the future. 
(14)  Materials having potential impacts on effluents or residuals disposal. Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent, or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solids Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(b)  Limitations. It is unlawful to discharge or convey to the public sewer any wastewater containing pollutants of such character or quantity that will: 
(1)  Not be amenable to treatment or will interfere with the sewerage facilities. 
(2)  Constitute a hazard to human or animal life, or to the stream or watercourse receiving the treatment plant effluent. 
(3)  Violate the federal pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Cause the treatment plant to violate its NPDES permit or other permits issued by the state department of health and environmental control. 
(c)  Dilution. Dilution of any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this article shall be considered a violation of this article. If waste producers are found to be within article limits and the wastes produced create adverse effects or interfere with any waters due to the total pounds discharged of toxic substances, the approving authority shall establish additional or more stringent limits as deemed necessary. 
(d)  National categorical pretreatment standards. Certain industrial customers are now or shall become subject to categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency specifying quantities or concen- trations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial customers subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall also be subject to the limitations established by this article or by the state. Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations in this article, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The city shall notify in writing all affected customers of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.1. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for existing sources subject to such standards or for existing sources which become subject to such standards shall be within 180 days from the effective date of the standards unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the standard. Specific compliance schedules will be developed by the city and made a part of the industrial user's discharge permit. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for new sources shall be required upon initiation of a discharge. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-4, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-81. - Industrial waste surcharge. 
(a)  Established. All customers making discharges of industrial waste shall pay a charge to cover the cost of collection, transmission, treatment and disposal. When a permit application for industrial waste is approved, the city or its authorized representative shall issue a permit stating the terms of acceptance by the city and the basis of payment. In the event a customer discharges abnormal industrial waste into the public sanitary sewerage system having an average suspended solids content in excess of 250 mg/l, and/or an average five day BOD in excess of 250 mg/l, customers shall pay a surcharge based upon the excess strength of their wastes as follows: 
(1)  BOD. Five day, 20 degrees Celsius BOD in excess of 250 mg/l shall be charged $0.28 per excess pound or fraction thereof. 
(2)  Suspended solids. Suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/l shall be charged $0.27 per excess pound or fraction thereof. 
(b)  Review. The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD or suspended solids removed by each treatment works may be reviewed by the city at the end of each fiscal year. If a discrepancy exists between the actual costs as found by the city and the estimated costs, the city shall increase or decrease the surcharge rates sufficiently to cover only the projected actual costs for the ensuing year. 
(c)  Reduction. No reduction in sewerage service charges, fees or taxes shall be permitted by reason of the fact that certain industrial wastes discharged to the public sanitary sewerage system contain less than 250 milligrams per liter of suspended solids or 250 milligrams per liter BOD. Such charges in this section adopted may be amended or adjusted from time to time in accordance with the adoption of rates and charges established by the city. 
(d)  Special fees. Special fees shall be assessed as needed to recover costs associated with abnormal remedial maintenance and repair, engineering and administrative efforts, surveillance and sampling cost, legal fees, and cleanup equipment directly attributable to the industry causing such actions to be taken. 
(e)  Surveillance and sampling fees. In addition to the self-monitoring required by this article, the city may conduct annual and/or random surveillance and sampling. Annual surveillance will generally be limited to a plant inspection. Random surveillance may include sampling in addition to the industrial customer's monitoring requirements to insure the industrial customer is complying with the requirements of its industrial discharge permit. The industrial customer will be required to reimburse the city for labor, equipment, outside service and analysis associated with the surveillance and sampling. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-5, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-82. - Control of prohibited wastes. 
(a)  Regulatory actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described in section 21-80 of this article are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the city or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the city shall take any action necessary to: 
(1)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater. 
(2)  Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will eliminate the discharge of such substances to a degree acceptable to the city. 
(3)  Require pretreatment including storage facilities or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate the provisions of this article. 
(4)  Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this article. 
(5)  Develop discharge limits by mass balance worksheet. 
(b)  Submission of plans. Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of its sewerage facilities is required by the city, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall be submitted to the approving authority for review and approval. Approval shall in no way constitute an exemption from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule or regulation of any governmental agency. Alterations or additions to a pretreatment or flow-control facility shall not be made without due notice to and approval of the approving authority. It will also be necessary to obtain a construction permit from the state department of health and environmental control before any pretreatment or flow control facilities can be built or modified in any way. 
(c)  Pretreatment facilities operations. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operation procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. It will also be necessary to obtain a construction permit from the state department of health and environmental control before any pretreatment or flow control facilities can be built or modified in any way. 
(d)  Reporting of accidental discharges. If an accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated pollutants to the sewerage facilities should occur, the industrial facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately verbally notify the city so that corrective action may be taken to protect the sewage facilities. In addition, a written report addressed to the city, detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the accidental discharge. It will also be a requirement that the state department of health and environmental control be notified of any accidental discharge by telephone immediately and a written report be submitted within five days. 
(e)  Confidential information. Information and data provided by a customer shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the customer specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the customer. Wastewater constituents and effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, or pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by any state or federal agency in judicial review of enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing this report. 
(f)  Right of entry. The city shall have the right to inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of its duties. The city, the state department of health and environmental control, and EPA shall also have the right to copy said records. The city, the state department of health and environmental control, and EPA shall have the right to set upon the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the user's premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, the state department of health and environmental control and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-6, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-83. - Industrial monitoring requirements. 
    In order to effectively administer and enforce the provisions of these regulations, the approving authority may ask any discharger to comply with any or all of the following requirements: 
(1)  Discharge reports. The approving authority may require discharge reports, including, but not limited to, questionnaires, technical reports, sampling reports, test analyses and periodic reports of wastewater discharge. 
(2)  Monitoring programs. The approving authority may require of users such technical or monitoring programs, including the submission of periodic reports, as such authority deems necessary or as required by the federal pretreatment regulations. The reasonableness of the cost or burden imposed is irrelevant and the discharger shall pay the applicable charge for the monitoring program, in addition to the sewage disposal and other charges established by the city. The monitoring program may require the discharger to conduct a sampling and analysis program of a frequency and type specified by the approving authority to demonstrate compliance with prescribed wastewater discharge limits. The discharger may either: 
a.  Conduct its own sampling and analysis program, provided it demonstrates to the approving authority that it has the necessary qualifications and facilities to perform the work; or 
b.  Engage the services of a private laboratory approved by the approving authority and certified by the state department of health and environmental control. 
(3)  Analysis of industrial wastewater. All of the preceding standards established in this article are to apply at the point where the industrial wastes are discharged into the public sanitary sewerage system and any chemical or mechanical corrective treatment required must be accomplished to practical completion before the wastes reach that point.

A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The industrial user must make application for a new permit 90 days prior to the expiration date of the permit. Provided this is done, the existing permit remains in effect until a new permit is issued. This does not relieve the city of its obligation to keep its permits current or of its liability in case of an audit by the state department of health and environmental control. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification and change by the approving authority during the life of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in this article are modified and changed. The user shall be informed in writing of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(f)  Transfer of a permit. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. An industrial discharge permit shall not be reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation. 
(Ord. No. 92-06, § 4-3-8, 1-28-92) 
Sec. 21-85. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Any person found to be violating any provision of this article shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. The city reserves the right, however, to immediately terminate any discharge into the city's system which, in the sole opinion of the city, may result in an endangerment to the health or welfare of the general populace or environment of the city. 
(b)  Remedies. If a hearing examiner determines that a discharger is in violation of this article and this determination is confirmed by the approving authority, the city may take the following actions: 
(1)  Prohibit the wastewater from entering the city's system. 
(2)  Require pretreatment necessary to reduce or eliminate pollutants so that the discharge will not violate this article. 
(3)  Require wastewater storage or flow equalization facilities necessary to control the quantities and rates of discharge. 
(4)  Require payment to cover the handling and treatment costs not covered by existing user charges. However, payment, other than for civil penalties, is not an alternative to pretreatment for prohibited wastes and/or for discharges which exceed maximum limitations defined in categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Take other remedial action necessary to achieve the purpose of these regulations, including a civil penalty and other costs or expenses as provided in this section. 
(c)  Determination of civil penalties, cost and expenses. 
(1)  Any customer who is found to have violated an order of the city or who willfully or negligently fails to comply with any provisions of the article and the order, rules, regulations and permits issued pursuant to this article shall pay not more than $2,000 dollars for each day of violation. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate, distinct violation. 
(2)  In addition to the civil penalties provided in this section, the hearing examiner may determine reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses incurred by the city for any hearings or enforcement procedure. 
(3)  In addition to the civil penalties provided in this section, any person who willfully or negligently violates permit conditions is also subject to criminal penalties including fines of up to $500.00 per day of violation and/or by imprisonment for 30 days. The permittee may also be subject to further sanctions imposed under the authority of state and/or federal law. 
(d)  City to disconnect service. The city reserves the right to terminate water and/or wastewater disposal services and disconnect a customer from the system in accordance with Act No. 397 of 1965, Act No. 1195 of 1974, S.C. Code 1976, § 6-11-1230, and such amendments thereto which may be adopted from time to time, when: 
(1)  The customer: 
a.  Discharges industrial waste or wastewater that is in violation of the permit issued by the city; 
b.  Discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment system; 
c.  Fails to pay monthly bills for water and sanitary sewer services, surcharges, special fees, and costs incurred for remediation when due; or 
d.  Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes into public sewers. 
(2)  Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released into the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfere with proper collection, transmission, treatment and disposal of wastewater. 
(3)  A governmental agency informs the city that the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge, and it is found that the customer is delivering wastewater to the city's system that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by the city as normal domestic treatment. 
(e)  Liability. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage experienced by the city by reason of such violation. 
(f)  Injunctive relief. In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (b) of this section, wherever a person violates any provision of this article or fails to comply with any order of the city, the city may apply to the court of the state for the issuance of an injunction restraining the person violating the article or failing to comply with the order from making any further discharges into the sewerage facilities under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(g)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $200.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or by both. Alternatively, such person may be subjected to civil penalties as provided in this section. 
(h)  Revocation of permit. The city may revoke a customer's discharge permit for the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of the conditions of the customer's discharge permit. 
(2)  Failure of the customer to report with reasonable accuracy any constituents in its discharge. 
(3)  Failure of the customer to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(4)  Refusal by the customer of reasonable access to its premises for inspection or monitoring purposes. 
(5)  Tampering with or knowingly altering the city's or customer's monitoring equipment. 
(i)  Suspension of permit for harmful discharges. 
(1)  The city may suspend a customer's sewer service or its discharge permit when necessary, in the city's opinion, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which endangers or may endanger the environment or the health and welfare of any persons. The city also may take such actions when the customer's discharge has a negative impact on operation and/or maintenance of the POTW, causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit, or causes the city to violate any sludge disposal guidelines and/or standards established by the EPA. 
(2)  A customer shall immediately eliminate its discharge when notified of a suspension. If the customer fails to comply voluntarily, the city shall take steps necessary, including discontinuing water service or severing the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize discharges to the city's sewer system or endangerment to individuals. 
(3)  The discharger shall submit a written report to the city within five days of a harmful discharge. A written report must also be submitted to the state department of health and environmental control within five days and immediate phone notification is required to both the city and the state department of health and environmental control. This report shall contain the information required in section 21-82 concerning accidental discharges. 
(4)  The city shall reinstate the discharge permit and sewer service upon proof that the discharger has eliminated the potentially harmful discharge. 
(j)  Public notification of violations. The city shall annually publish in the Sun News a list of the customers which were significantly violating any pretreatment requirements or standards. A significant violation shall mean a violation of discharge limitations that meets one or more of the following criteria or a violation of compliance schedule milestone as follows: 
(1)  Chronic violations in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations in which 33 percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period for the same parameter equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease; and TRC = 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or monthly average) that the city determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough (including endangering the health of the treatment system personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge causing imminent endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment or resulting in the city's use of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required reports, such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the customer(s) during the same 12 months. This notification shall be sent to EPA, the state department of health and environmental control, the state industrial commission and state development board.

This exclusion includes without limitation, sidewalks, parking, and ingress/egress areas appurtenant to such other use. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 2, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-103. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  City council finds that the city's rights-of-way constitute valuable public property: 
(1)  Having been acquired and maintained by the city over many years at taxpayer expense; 
(2)  Being capable of providing rights-of-way uniquely valuable to private companies for providing cable services; 
(3)  Constituting public investments for which the taxpayers are entitled to a fair monetary return on the city's past and future investment in the city's infrastructure; and 
(4)  Comprising significant assets that should be managed fairly and appropriately to enhance the public safety and economy. 
(b)  Therefore, this article is intended to: 
(1)  Regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, dismantling, testing, repair and use of the cable system in, upon, along, across, above, over or under or in any manner connected with the rights-of-way, public ways or public places within the jurisdiction of the city, as now or in the future may exist; 
(2)  Permit and manage reasonable access to the public ways of the city for cable purposes on a competitively neutral basis; 
(3)  Conserve the limited physical capacity of the rights-of-way held in the public trust by the city; 
(4)  Assure that all cable companies providing facilities or services within the city comply with the ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city; 
(5)  Assure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
(6)  Enable the city to discharge its public trust consistent with rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition, and technological development. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 3, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-104. - Franchise agreement. 
(a)  Issuance of franchises subject to agreement; conflicts with agreements and ordinance. Within 60 days after written notification of the award of a franchise by the city, a selected applicant shall execute the franchise agreement approved by city council which shall set forth the terms and provisions of the franchise. 
(b)  Relationship of franchise and franchise agreement to laws. Each franchise issued by the city is subject to, and franchisee must exercise all rights granted to it in accordance with, its franchise agreement and applicable law, including this article. This article is not a contract with any franchisee and may be amended. 
(c)  Nature of franchise agreements. Each franchise agreement is a contract, subject to the city's exercise of its police and other powers. A franchise agreement shall not confer any rights upon the franchisee or limitations upon the city other than as expressly provided therein. Subject to the exercise of the city's police and other powers, in the case of any conflict between the express terms of a franchise agreement and the express terms of this article, the provisions of this article shall govern. A franchisee, by entering into a franchise agreement, does not waive its rights to challenge the lawfulness of any particular enactment after the date the franchise is issued, including on the grounds that a particular enactment is an unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 4, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-105. - Policy of innovation. 
    Recognizing the fluid and expanding state of the development of communications technology and uses, it is the policy of the city to strongly encourage experimentation and innovation in the development of cable system technology uses, services, programming and techniques that will be of general benefit to the community; provided that all such experiments and innovations shall be subject to the rules of the FCC and any other federal, state and city laws and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 5, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-106. - Time is of the essence. 
    Whenever this article or the franchise agreement sets forth any time for any act to be performed by the franchisee, such time shall be deemed of the essence; and the franchisee's failure to perform within the time allotted shall, in all cases, be sufficient grounds for the city to invoke the remedies available under the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 6, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-107. - Franchise required. 
(a)  Franchise required. No person shall construct, install, maintain or operate a cable system within, along or under any rights-of-way in the city, or any other public property in the city, unless a franchise has first been granted by city council pursuant to the provisions of this article, and unless the franchise agreement is in full force and effect. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to require the granting of any initial franchise when in the opinion of the city it would not be in the public interest to do so. 
(b)  Franchise nonexclusive. Any franchise granted pursuant to this article by the city shall not be exclusive, and the city specifically reserves the right to grant other franchises to any persons or to authorize itself to provide cable services without a franchise at any time and in any area of the city if the city determines that it is in the public interest to do so. 
(c)  Franchise binding. All provisions of this article and any franchise agreement shall be binding upon the franchisee, its successors, lessees, or assignees. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 7, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-108. - Grant of authority. 
(a)  Length of franchise. Any franchise granted by the city pursuant to this article shall commence upon execution of the franchise agreement by the franchisee and the city and shall be for a period specified by the franchise. In determining the term of a franchise, it is the intent of the city that the term be established so that all franchises for the use of public rights-of-way (including cable, telecommunications, and other utilities) shall expire on approximately the same date. A franchise agreement may be renewed pursuant to the provisions of this article and federal law. No privilege or exemption shall be inferred from the granting of any franchise unless it is specifically prescribed. 
(b)  No right of property. The granting of any franchise pursuant to this article shall be a privilege and shall not impart to the franchisee any right of property in any city rights-of-way or other city property. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 8, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-109. - Regulatory framework. 
(a)  Continuing regulatory jurisdiction. City council shall have continuing regulatory jurisdiction and supervision over the operation of any franchise granted pursuant to this article. However, it is recognized that the daily administrative, supervisory and enforcement responsibilities of the provisions of this article and the franchise agreement shall be delegated and entrusted to the city manager, or his designee, as hereafter provided. 
(b)  City manager responsibilities. The city manager shall have the following responsibilities and authority: 
(1)  Interpret, administer and enforce the provisions of this article and the franchise agreement; 
(2)  Represent the city in all matters pertaining to the implementation of the provisions of this article and the franchise agreement; 
(3)  Resolve disputes or disagreements between subscribers, users, potential subscribers and users, and the franchisee as to matters involving an interpretation of this article or the franchise agreement, or other matters subject to the city's jurisdiction, but only in the event that such parties are unable first to resolve their dispute; provided that, nothing in this section is meant to waive any rights a franchisee may have to appeal the city's resolution of a dispute; 
(4)  Review and audit reports and other documents submitted to the city as required by this article or other law, so as to ensure that the necessary reports are completed and fulfilled pursuant to the terms of this article; 
(5)  Assure that all records, rules and charges pertinent to the system are made available for inspection at reasonable hours upon reasonable notice consistent with the franchise agreement and applicable law; 
(6)  Consistent with this article, establish and administer sanctions as authorized by city council to ensure compliance with this article; 
(7)  Advise city council on matters that may constitute grounds for termination or revocation of the franchise agreement in accordance with this article and a franchise; 
(8)  Advise city council on proposed transfers of the system; 
(9)  Consistent with this article, promulgate regulations regarding the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, dismantling, testing or use of the system as necessary; 
(10)  Perform any other duties assigned under the provisions of this article or other legislation that may hereafter be enacted by city council or such other related duties as city council may direct. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 9, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-110. - Construction and maintenance. 
(a)  Application. Prior to beginning construction of any cable system facility, including any curb cut or pavement cut, the applicant shall obtain permission from the department of public works of the city to carry out construction activities in the city's streets, and shall comply with all requirements of that department or any other ordinance or code applicable hereto. 
(b)  Construction plan. Prior to beginning construction, the applicant shall submit a plan describing the proposed construction. The plan shall specify: 
(1)  The design of any cable system facilities to be constructed or utilized; 
(2)  A map showing the precise location of any cable system facility to be constructed or utilized and any appurtenant facilities such as poles, attachments, guy wires, and the like; 
(3)  The timetable for completion of construction, including any phases of construction; 
(4)  Such other information as will provide the city with pertinent information relating to the construction of the cable system facilities, including any pertinent information requested by the city. 
(c)  Prior authority. Prior to beginning construction, the applicant shall have received all necessary regulatory authority to construct a cable system facility or provide cable service from all appropriate state or federal agencies. Evidence that it has received such regulatory authority, or that such authority is not required, shall be filed with the city. 
(d)  Standards of construction. The method of construction, workmanship used, and materials utilized in the construction shall conform to all applicable federal, state, and local statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances. All work shall be performed in a safe, thorough, and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality so as not to create a hazard or dangerous condition on the streets. If, at any time, it is determined by the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any cable system facility presents a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, then the cable provider shall, at its own cost and expense, after reasonable notice from the city, promptly correct all such conditions. 
(e)  Maintenance and repair. Any cable system facility constructed or utilized pursuant to a franchise agreement shall be maintained and repaired in accordance with the standards and under the terms and conditions set out in the preceding paragraph and such other terms and conditions as shall appear in this article or the agreement. 
(f)  Minimal disruption. Construction, maintenance and repair of the cable system facilities shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize any interference with or disruption of the city's streets, traffic, residences, businesses and institutions. Where underground construction is required by this article the provider shall be obligated to use trenchless technology in appropriate circumstances as determined by the city's director of public works. 
(g)  Restoration. Any disturbance of the city's streets shall be repaired and restored by the cable provider at its expense to a condition as good as that prevailing before the work causing such disturbance was commenced. If at any time the city determines that any restoration performed by the provider is deficient to the extent that it poses an immediate threat to the safety of the public, the city shall have the right to undertake emergency repairs or other protective actions as may in its opinion be necessary and the provider shall reimburse the city for all costs of such repair or other actions. If any restoration performed by the cable provider does not comply with the standards established in this section, the city may, after ten days written notice to the provider, perform necessary repairs to bring the restoration up to such standards and the provider shall reimburse the city for all costs of such repair. 
(h)  Location of facilities. Poles and other facilities shall be located to the extent feasible in such a way as to minimize their effect on the visual landscape and on other aesthetic considerations and so as to minimize inconvenience. 
(i)  Burial of facilities. It is the intent of city council that all utility facilities, including all cable system facilities, be underground in all areas of the city as quickly as is technically and economically feasible. All providers who enter into a franchise agreement or consent agreement with the city shall acknowledge that they will be required to place all facilities underground at their own expense upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately in any area of the city where all existing electric, telephone, and cable television lines are currently underground. 
(2)  Within three years after the expiration, earlier termination, or material amendment of the existing electric franchise granted to the South Carolina Public Service Commission (Santee Cooper). The Santee Cooper franchise will expire under its terms on June 30, 2005. 
(3)  At such time as the city requires all holders of existing telephone, electric, and cable franchises or consent agreements to place their facilities underground. If the city establishes the requirement in a specific area of the city this provision shall apply to all facilities in that area. If the city establishes this requirement city-wide it shall apply to all providers city-wide. 
(4)  During the pendency of any litigation which may be brought by a competitor that has the effect of delaying the placement of that competitor's facilities underground, a provider may elect, at its own risk, to install above ground facilities within any area subject to the litigation, but will be required to place its facilities underground at its own expense upon a final determination of the litigation that upholds the requirement to place the facilities underground. 
    In extreme circumstances city council may, by ordinance, grant permission for the installation of limited aboveground facilities if council finds that underground installation would be technically impractical or cause extreme economic hardship. In all cases similarly impacted providers shall be treated similarly. 
    Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or discourage agreements between providers and the city to provide incentives for the placement of facilities underground earlier than herein provided. 
(j)  Co-location; sharing of pole space and conduits. To the maximum extent feasible, a cable provider constructing a new transmission line or other facility, or expanding an existing line or facility, will endeavor to utilize existing pole space or conduit facilities. The owner of any existing facility shall to the extent permitted by law and consistent with any pole attachment regulations of the public service commission, the Federal Communications Commission or other appropriate agency, permit the cable system provider to utilize its poles or conduits. 
(k)  Movement of facilities. A cable system provider shall be required to temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its facilities at its own expense when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; or the construction, installation or repair of any public road, highway, building, park or other public project. The provider shall cooperate with any other public utility authorized by the city to provide utility service utilizing the city's streets. If the city compensates any use of the public rights-of-way for such disconnection or relocation, then each franchisee shall be similarly compensated. To the extent any removal or relocation is required for the benefit of any party other than the city, the provider may require payment of the actual cost of the removal or relocation by the benefitted party. 
(l)  Tree trimming. The zoning ordinance of the city provides that an annual permit may be issued to a provider exempting the provider from the provisions of the city's tree protection ordinance, but requires that the provider shall nevertheless conform its tree-trimming practices to the 1995 ANSI A300 Standards. The provider shall give the city zoning administrator 24 hours notice prior to undertaking any tree trimming. The zoning administrator may choose to observe any tree trimming performed by a provider and, if the required standards are not complied with, take all necessary enforcement action the administrator determines to be appropriate pursuant to the zoning ordinance. In the event a provider is found to have repeatedly violated the required standards in performing tree trimming, the city may pursue any available remedies. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 10, 4-27-99) 
Sec. 21-111. - Use of existing utility poles and facilities. 
    Each franchisee assumes all responsibility for gaining permission from any electric, gas or telephone utility in the city for the use, rental or lease of poles, underground conduits and other structures and facilities for the purpose of extending, carrying or laying the franchisee's wires, cables, electronic conductors and other facilities and appurtenances necessary or desirable in conjunction with the establishment and operation of the system. 
(Ord. No. 990427-19, § 11, 4-27-99)

Sec. 21-125. - Declaration of purpose and intent. 
    The City of Myrtle Beach understands the fundamental need to make efficient use of the limited and valuable water resource under its stewardship in order to protect the public's health and safety and environmental integrity. The purpose of this document is to establish a plan and procedures for managing water demand and evaluating supply options before and during a drought-related water shortage. The intent is to satisfy the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 (Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, section 49-23-10, et seq., as amended) with the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and to provide water for other purposes in an equitable manner. Therefore, the City of Myrtle Beach has adopted this drought management plan and drought response ordinance that provide the policies and the authority to fulfill this obligation. The drought management plan outlines the framework by which the City of Myrtle Beach will internally prepare for water shortages. The ordinance provides the regulations by which the City of Myrtle Beach will manage and control its customer water usage during various levels of a drought. 
(Ord. No. 2003-43, 6-10-03)

(Ord. No. 2003-43, 6-10-03) 
Sec. 21-127. - Drought management plan. 
(a)  Introduction. To ensure that the City of Myrtle Beach adequately manages its water system during drought-related conditions, an organized plan is necessary for system operation and reliability, proper communications, effective coordination and ultimate allocation of water use. Prior planning will compliment the City of Myrtle Beach ability to respond to drought conditions and to enforce the related ordinance. 
(b)  Designation of water system drought response representative. Administrating a drought plan requires the skills needed to undertake a comprehensive public information program and the judgment required to deal with equity issues arising from enforcement of a mandatory program. Someone who has these skills will be selected by the water system to manage the water system's program and serve as the principal contact for the news media as the water system's drought response representative. The drought response representative for the City of Myrtle Beach is: 
Deputy Director of Public Works 
City of Myrtle Beach 
3210 Mr. Joe White Avenue 
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina 29577 
1-843-918-2000 
(c)  Description of water system layout, water sources, capacities and yields. The City of Myrtle Beach is located in the Northeast Drought Response Management Area of South Carolina. The system serves: The City of Myrtle Beach and the City of North Myrtle Beach and certain sections of unincorporated territory adjacent to the cities to the North and West. The service area of the City of Myrtle Beach is approximately 22 square miles with an estimated residential population of 33,675. The service area of the City of North Myrtle Beach is approximately 20 square miles with an estimated residential population of 12,500. The treated water is pumped either directly into the distribution system or into 15 elevated/ground storage tanks providing a total of 11.5 million gallons. The water distribution network connects approximately 238 miles of predominately cast- iron/PVC water mains of which approximately 180 miles are of six-inch to 48-inch diameter. The quality of the lines is considered to be overall good to excellent. Over 50 percent of the distribution lines have been installed within the last ten years. The surface water treatment facility is currently rated at 29.5 million gallons a day. It is currently being expanded to 40 million gallons a day to accommodate future growth. This expansion is scheduled to be completed by January 1, 2004. The water supply sources available to the system are: Atlantic Intra-Coastal Waterway is the source water for the City of Myrtle Beach Surface Water Treatment Facility; Bull Creek is the source water for the five million gallons a day from Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority (Inter-connects) The SCDHEC total permitted capacity of the water system operated by the City of Myrtle Beach is 30,000,000 being expanded to a permitted capacity of 40,000,000 by January 1, 2004, gallons per day. 
(d)  Identification of water system specific drought or water shortage indicators. Operators of every water system must develop historical trends that are valuable indicators of a system's ability to meet demand when demand begins to outpace supply. The City of Myrtle Beach has developed triggers for use during drought or demand water shortages that describe when specific phases of the drought response ordinance are implemented. The system triggers are as follows: 
Moderate drought phase (include the relevant following examples:) 
(1)  Reservoirs _____ full. 
(2)  Storage falls below _____ percentage of capacity. 
(3)  Stream-flow less than _____ cubic feet per second. 
(4)  Aquifer levels less than _____. 
(5)  _____ number of days of supply remaining. 
(6)  Average daily use greater than _____ mgd for _____ consecutive days. 
(7)  Others: 
Saltwater/freshwater interface in the Atlantic IntraCoastal Waterway located in vicinity of North Myrtle Beach Airport. 
Severe drought phase (include the relevant following examples:) 
(1)  Reservoirs _____ full. 
(2)  Storage falls below _____ percentage of capacity. 
(3)  Stream-flow less than _____ cubic feet per second. 
(4)  Aquifer levels less than _____. 
(5)  _____ number of days of supply remaining. 
(6)  Average daily use greater than _____ mgd for _____ consecutive days. 
(7)  Others: 
Saltwater/freshwater interface in the Atlantic IntraCoastal Waterway located in vicinity of Briarcliffe Forest. 
Extreme drought phase (include the relevant following examples:) 
(1)  Reservoirs _____ full. 
(2)  Storage falls below _____ percentage of capacity. 
(3)  Stream-flow less than _____ cubic feet per second. 
(4)  Aquifer levels less than _____. 
(5)  _____ number of days of supply remaining. 
(6)  Average daily use greater than _____ mgd for _____ consecutive days. 
(7)  Others: 
Saltwater/freshwater interface in the Atlantic IntraCoastal Waterway located in vicinity of Grande Dunes Bridge. 
Cooperative agreements and alternative water supply sources: Successful drought management requires a comprehensive program by the water utility. In many situations administrative agreements are required with other agencies to fully implement the plan. Agreements with other water purveyors may be necessary for alternative water supply sources. Other agreements that strengthen conservation efforts by large users may be necessary. The City of Myrtle Beach identifies the following agreements that are in place to facilitate the implementation of this plan: The City of Myrtle Beach currently has two inter-connects with Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority. Approximately five million gallons a day of water can be provided to either party (bi-directional option). Although interconnected, this cannot be considered as a "back-up" water supply for the City of Myrtle Beach. Source water supplies for both treatment facilities would be affected while experiencing various drought conditions. 
(e)  Description of pre-drought planning efforts. Before the occurrence of a water supply shortage and the need to implement the emergency provisions of the ordinance, it is important that certain pre-response measures be taken with the aim of conserving the system's source water, as well as the water distributed to the customer. In regards to the conservation measures listed below, the City of Myrtle Beach has taken the following actions: 
(1)  Identification of all major water users of the system (top ten percent, include wholesale customers): 
City of North Myrtle Beach 
AVX Corporation 
Myrtle Beach Primary, Middle, Elementary, and High Schools 
(2)  Identification of those users with whom there are conservation agreements: N/A. 
(3)  A vigorous public education program is critical for achieving substantial water use reductions. An effective public outreach program will keep the public informed about the water supply situation, what actions will mitigate drought emergency problems, and how well the public is doing in terms of meeting the program goals. Keeping the public involved, informed, and participating in the decision-making process is key to implementing an effective drought management plan. The City of Myrtle Beach maintains regular communication with local news media, providing news releases and media advisories as needed for drought-related messages. In addition, city guests frequently appear on television and radio talk shows to share information. Further, the city publishes a variety of newsletters and brochures that can be used to communicate drought-related messages. A 24-hour cable information channel carries information about city activities, including any drought-related messages. Utility bills also can be used to carry drought-related messages. Water-saving tips and other drought-related information is prepared in advance, should a drought response public education program be needed. 
(f)  Description of capital planning and investment for system reliability and demand forecasting. Water utilities routinely find that capital improvements to the system strongly enhance their ability to get through times of drought. It is important that every water utility aggressively plan and build for future needs. The utility must continue to provide for system operation flexibility, improved pumping and storage capacity and new technologies to meet the demands of tomorrow. Describe the utility's capital improvement program and how past efforts have enhanced your system's ability to meet demand during drought conditions; 
(g)  Description of other system improvements. The City of Myrtle Beach currently has ten deep wells that can be used for potable water supply. These wells remain available as a result of maintaining them over the years after transitioning from a well system to a surface water system in the late 1980's. The total water volume that can be provided by these wells is approximately six and one-half million gallons a day. This equates to approximately 25 percent of the summer demand of 2002 including the water provided to the City of North Myrtle Beach. The city is in the process of researching the feasibility of installing additional deep wells to provide water in during drought conditions. 
*Note: The city is in the process of expanding the surface water treatment facility from 30 MGD to 40 MGD at an approximate cost of $4,000,000.00. This expansion is expected to accommodate the anticipated growth of our system until the year 2010-2011. 
(Ord. No. 2003-43, 6-10-03) 
Sec. 21-128. - Drought response ordinance. 
(a)  Declaration of policy and authority. The objective of this drought response ordinance is to establish authority, policy and procedure by which the City of Myrtle Beach will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. The ordinance satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000 and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner. 
This article outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the City of Myrtle Beach. These actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply. 
To satisfy these goals, the City of Myrtle Beach hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This ordinance is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health, safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the City of Myrtle Beach. 
If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought, the city of Myrtle Beach is authorized to issue a proclamation (a "proclamation") that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water-use for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs becomes endangered. 
Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and restrictions set forth under this ordinance shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded. 
Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this ordinance are considered to be non-essential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the offender(s) to penalties. 
The drought management plan as outlined in sections 21-125-21-127 is hereby approved. 
(b)  Moderate drought phase. Upon notification by the drought response committee that a moderate drought condition is present and is expected to persist and/or upon determination by the City of Myrtle Beach that a moderate water supply shortage exists based on trigger levels, the City of Myrtle Beach will seek voluntary reductions from its customers in the use of water for all purposes and voluntary reductions on using water during certain peak water demand periods. Specifically, the goal during this phase is to achieve a reduction of ten percent in residential water use and ten percent in other water uses such as commercial, industrial, institutional and irrigation; and a reduction in overall water use of ten percent. To accomplish this, the City of Myrtle Beach will take the following actions: 
(1)  Issue a proclamation to be released to local media, the City of Myrtle Beach's customers and to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center that moderate drought conditions are present. 
(2)  Provide written notification to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Drought Information Center and routinely publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the service area of the water system the voluntary conservation measures that the customers are requested to follow during moderate drought conditions, including:

Article 5. BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
a. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property;

3. In granting a variance the Board may attach conditions to it. These conditions may address the location, character, or other features of the proposed building, structure or use. The Board may set these conditions to protect established property values in the surrounding area or to promote the public health, safety or general welfare.
4. The Board may not grant a variance the effect of which would be to allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning district, to extend physically a nonconforming use of land, or to change zoning district boundaries shown on the official Zoning Map.

6. An owner is not entitled to relief from a self-created or self-inflicted hardship. A claim of unnecessary hardship cannot be based on conditions created by the owner nor can one who purchases property after enactment of a zoning regulation complain that the nonconforming use would work as a hardship upon him.
7. The procedure for the amendment of a variance already approved, or a request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for a new application.

8. Landscaping. In the event that strict compliance with the standards of Article 9 - Landscaping and Tree Protection conflict with existing federal or state statutory or regulatory requirements, the developer may submit to the Construction Services Department a Request for a zoning variance including a specific alternate planting plan. This plan must meet the purposes and standards of Article 9 - Landscaping and Tree Protection, but may suggest measures other than those specified within Article 9 - Landscaping and Tree Protection. In addition, if the developer seeks a modification of planting requirements based upon a contention that the planting required by Article 9 - Landscaping and Tree Protection would pose a threat to health and safety due to a conflict with existing federal or state statutory or regulatory requirements, a modification will only be considered upon receipt of a written explanation of the alleged conflict created 54

1. The Board shall have the power to permit uses by special exception, subject to the standards and conditions for the uses set forth for such uses in Article 15  Conditional And Accessory Uses And Special Exceptions. Compliance with all required notice provisions of Article 5  Board Of Zoning Appeals shall be followed for each and every hearing held.

b. The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such reasonable restrictions and conditions as in its opinion will accomplish the intent of this Ordinance.
c. A use listed as a special exception is eligible for location within a district in which it is indicated in Article 14  Zoning Districts, provided it can demonstrate the following conditions exist:

2. The procedure for the amendment of a special exception, or a request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for a new application. However, minor changes may be decided and approved by the Zoning Administrator if the change(s):
a. Do not alter the concept of the Special Exception;
b. Do not change the permitted land uses;

Therefore, all ocean front properties and all properties in all commercial and multifamily zoning districts are designated as areas and corridors requiring protection for the preservation of scenic vistas and architectural compatibility. Moreover, the City Council also finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity, inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of structures and signs and the lack of proper attention to site development and landscaping in the business, commercial, industrial, and certain residential areas of the City hinders the harmonious development and expansion of the City, severely limits commercial growth, impairs the desirability of residence, investment or occupation in the City, limits the opportunity to attain the optimum use and value of land and improvements, adversely affects the stability and value of the property, produces deterioration of property in such areas with attendant worsening of conditions affecting the peace, health and welfare of the City, and destroys a suitable relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services therefore.
601.B. Objectives. The Council declares that the objectives of site development requirements and the site design review procedures are to:
1. Encourage originality, flexibility, and innovation in site planning and development, including the architecture, landscaping, and graphic design of said development;
2. Discourage monotonous, drab, unsightly, dreary and inharmonious developments;
3. Conserve the City's natural beauty and visual character and charm by insuring that structures, signs, and other improvements are properly related to their sites, and to surrounding sites and structures with due regard to the aesthetic qualities of the ocean front, beaches, sand dunes, swashes, lakes, and vegetation and that proper attention is given to the exterior appearance of structures, signs, and other improvements;
4. Protect and enhance the City's appeal to residents, tourists, and visitors and thus support and stimulate business and industry and promote the desirability of investment and occupancy in business, commercial and industrial properties;
5. Stabilize and improve property values and prevent blighted areas and, thus, increase tax revenues;
6. Achieve the beneficial influence of pleasant environments for living and working on behavioral patterns and, thus, decrease the cost of governmental services;
7. Foster civic pride and community spirit so as to improve the quality and quantity of government and in growth, change, and improvement;

Section 604. Criteria and Standards
604.A. In their review of site and building plans, including all accessory buildings, structures, exterior signs and other site features, the Board shall be guided by the objectives of section 601.B - Objectives, utilizing the following standards. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements, nor are they intended to discourage creativity, invention, or innovation. The specification of one or more particular architectural styles is not included in these standards.
1. Preservation of Landscape. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state. In so far as practicable by minimizing tree and soil removal, any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas.
2. Relation of Proposed Buildings To Environment. Proposed structures shall relate harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed buildings. The achievement of such relationship may include the enclosure of space in conjunction with other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the creation of focal points with respect to line of sight, avenues of approach, terrain features, existing urban forest, or other buildings.
3. Drives, Parking And Circulation. With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives, and parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and arrangement of 62
Article 6. COMMUNITY APPEARANCE BOARD
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
parking areas that are safe and convenient and, in so far as practicable, that do not detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties.
4. Utility Service. Whenever feasible, onsite electric, telephone, and other utility lines shall be underground. Any utility installations remaining above ground shall be located so as to have a harmonious relationship to neighboring properties and the site.
5. Advertising Features.

7. Aboveground Structured Parking Standards.
The purpose of these standards is to require mixed-use development, enhance the physical appearance of the community, create pedestrian-friendly environments and to assist developers to achieve maximum aesthetic value. The standards create positive, pedestrian-
oriented environments while still providing needed parking. This is most effectively accomplished by masking parking garages so that they integrate into the surrounding built-environment, rather than creating a lifeless mass, as well as, by creating inviting, mixed-use environments that foster pedestrian activity.

i. All conversion alternatives are limited to 400 square feet of sign face per side, depending on the current sign face configuration (single or double faced), and no more than one sign face per side. No roof top traditional billboard may be converted into CEMVS.

Example: remove two billboards from Highway 501, and convert an existing billboard on 501 into a CEMVS. If the proposed conversion is double faced, with 400 square feet on each side, then the conversion CEMVS can be double faced, with 400 square feet on each side, but no conversion can have more than one face per side or be on a rooftop.

iv. After removing any two sign structures and supporting sign structures within three hundred twenty five (325) feet of each other on the same tax map number lot, which displays not less than eight (8) faces from a designated corridor, the owner of existing traditional billboard signs shall be eligible to receive a building permit to construct on that same tax map number lot one (1) double face or single face CEVMS billboard. Example: remove two stacked double faced billboards from either Highway 501,Kings or 17 Bypass and convert an existing billboard on that same site into a CEMVS.

Example: remove any rooftop billboards anywhere in the City, and convert an existing billboard on 501, Kings or 17 Bypass into a CEMVS. If the proposed conversion is double faced, with 400 square feet on each side, then the conversion CEMVS can be double faced, with 400 square feet on each side, but no conversion can have more than one face per side or be on a rooftop.

All regulations contained within Article 9  Landscaping And Tree Protection that are not altered by the following special requirements are still applicable. 171
Article 9. LANDSCAPING AND TREE PROTECTION
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
1. Perimeter natural area. Existing forested areas on the periphery of sites shall be preserved to maintain the natural character of the area. A minimum 15-foot area adjacent to all adjacent properties (excluding rights-of-way) shall remain in a natural state, except for maintenance and limited clearing of vegetation two inches or less in caliper after written request has been received and approved by the zoning administrator. Where areas between site development and Single-family (R), Multifamily (RM), residential Planned Unit Developments (PUD) or Parks, Recreation and Conservation (PRC) districts are not forested, a planted berm (as defined in Article 2 - Definitions) shall be provided.
2. Perimeter parking lot landscaping. When areas between parking lots and adjacent properties and rights-of-way are forested with existing trees, these trees shall be preserved to buffer parking lots from adjacent properties and rights-of-way. Where these areas are not forested, a planted berm shall be established around all edges of the parking lot which do not face the principal use building.
3. Interior parking lot landscaping requirements. A minimum of eight percent of the total area of parking lots that exceed 1,500 square feet shall be provided for landscape areas, of which 75 percent of the interior landscape area shall be surrounded by vehicular use area. Interior landscape areas shall be a minimum of 180 square feet, have a maximum creditable size of 1,500 square feet, have a minimum linear dimension of nine feet, and have no less than four feet of clearance from the edge of any tree (planted or existing) to any curbing or paved area. Interior landscape areas shall be located to preserve specimen trees and tree stands where applicable. One upper story tree of at least four inches caliper shall be required per each 150 square feet of required interior landscape area and shall be located so as to maximize shade throughout the vehicular use area.
4. Landscaping requirements for all other vehicular use areas. In order to preserve a natural environment and mitigate the loss of trees, a minimum of 8 percent of the total vehicular use area not considered in 902.D.3 - Interior Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements will be used as the basis for determining reforestation requirements. One tree for every 100 square feet of this area shall be planted in a way that furthers the purpose as stated above, except that none of these trees shall be planted in designated wetlands or the required perimeter buffer. (e.g. 10,000 sq. ft. of driveway × 8% = 800 ÷ 100 = 8 trees)
5. Planted berm specifications. The earthen portion of planted berms shall have a minimum height of three feet, and have a maximum side slope of 3:1. The following plant materials shall be installed, in an informally grouped fashion, per each 100 linear feet:
a. Three upper story trees, with a minimum caliper measurement of 3.5 inches at installation.
b. Six under story trees, with a minimum caliper measurement of two inches at installation.
c. Nine evergreen shrubs, with a minimum container size of ten gallons at installation.
172
Article 9. LANDSCAPING AND TREE PROTECTION
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
6. Credit for undisturbed areas. Any area that remains undisturbed that brings the total undisturbed area to over the 20 percent minimum requirement will receive credit for saved trees, provided these areas are forested. The credit will be twice the number of trees required for reforestation (per section 902.D.4 - Landscaping Requirements For All Other Vehicular Use Areas) times the percentage of undisturbed area exceeding the required minimum of 20 percent. (e.g. 50,000 sq. ft. of private roads × 8% ÷ 100 sq. ft. = 40 trees required for reforestation; 30 percent undisturbed area 20% = 10% in excess of minimum required; therefore 2 × 40 trees × 10% = 8 trees credit)
7. Plant material. Trees used for reforestation may be a mix of the following:
a. Upper story trees with at least a four-inch caliper at the time of planting shall comprise at least 75 percent of the required trees.
b. Under story trees with at least a two-inch caliper at the time of planting may comprise the balance of the required trees.
c. With the exception of undisturbed natural areas, ground cover shall cover all portions of landscape areas.
902.E. Special Landscape Requirements for the Entertainment (E) District. These requirements are intended to soften the impact of high use roadways, large expansive parking areas and to promote green areas within this zoning district.
1. Boundaries along streets that extend beyond the boundaries of the district will have one large upper story tree (four-inch caliper, rated at time of planting) planted for every 1,000 square feet of buffer. If desired, two lower story trees (two-inch caliper rated at time of planting) may be substituted for one upper story tree, for no more than 30 percent total of the required upper story trees. The buffer area shall be calculated by using 30 feet as the width of the buffer multiplied by the linear feet of abutting streets. The actual buffer area will be seeded or sodded with a high-grade turf that will withstand the local climatic conditions. Shrubs may be used as a replacement for turf as desired, however, the shrub beds shall not extend farther than four feet from the base of any shrub nor shall the spacing of shrubs in any bed exceed four feet. In-ground irrigation shall be installed and proper operation maintained to support and sustain all the landscape material.
2. There shall be a minimum five-foot landscape buffer between the public rights-of-way and all parking areas. The buffers will have at least one tree planted for every 30 linear feet of buffer. At least 50 percent of the required trees must be upper story trees. The remainder of the actual buffer areas will be seeded or sodded with a high grade turf that will withstand the local conditions. Shrubs may be used as a replacement for turf as desired. However shrub beds will not extend farther than four feet from the base of any shrub nor may the spacing of shrubs in any bed exceed four feet. Viable in-ground irrigation shall be installed and proper operation maintained to support and sustain the landscape material.
902.F. Credit for Existing Trees Saved. It will be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to determine the amount of credit given towards the number of required trees based upon the number of trees saved during development.
1. When requirements dictate the quantity of trees on the property, the amount
173
Article 9. LANDSCAPING AND TREE PROTECTION
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
credited shall be based upon the formula used in section 903.I - Mitigation Policy.
2. When requirements dictate spacing of trees in vehicular use areas, the distance from existing trees to vehicles will be measured from the drip line of the existing tree provided the existing tree is at least four inches in caliper with a 15-foot canopy. The dripline of the trees proposed to be saved shall be indicated on the landscape and site plan.
902.G. Installation and Maintenance.

2 c. Amount of area required for each loading space. Each off-street loading and unloading space required by the provisions of this ordinance shall be at least 12 feet wide, 40 feet long and 14 feet high. Such space shall be clear and free of obstruction at all times. d. Location of off-street loading areas. Required off-street loading and unloading areas shall in all cases be located on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve. In no case shall the required off-street loading space be considered as part of the area provided to satisfy off-street parking requirements as listed hereinabove. e. Adequacy of loading area. All uses, whether specified in this ordinance or not, shall provide off-street loading areas sufficient for their requirements. Such space shall be adequate so that no vehicle being loaded or unloaded in connection with normal operations shall stand in or project into a public street, walk, alley, or way.
Section 1007. Standards for Off-Site Parking Facilities
If a lot on which a permitted use is conducted (permitted use site) is not large enough to provide for all the required automobile parking spaces, such required spaces may be provided on other off-street property only if the following conditions are satisfied:
1007.A. Parking facilities are a permitted use within the zoning district where the off-site parking facility is to be located.
1007.B. The location of the parking facility complies with the following criteria:
193
1. The off-site parking facility is contiguous to the permitted principal use site; or
2. The off-site parking facility is no more than three hundred feet, airline measurement, from the nearest property line of the principal permitted use site; or
3. The off-site parking facility is no more than three hundred feet, airline measurement, from any associated parking lot contiguous to the principal permitted use site.
1007.C. Required off-site parking spaces shall be authorized solely for use by the principal permitted use supported. The parking spaces shall not be increased, decreased, or encroached upon in any manner unless first authorized by written consent of the City. This requirement shall in no way discourage or prevent the use of shared parking facilities as allowed by this ordinance. The owner or authorized agent for the land upon which such remote parking is to be located shall provide a one-dollar ($1.00) mortgage, accompanied by a plat showing the boundaries of the proposed off-site parking lot. Both documents shall be properly filed with the Register of Mesne Conveyance for Horry County, and may be released only by the written consent of the City at such time as the restricted parking is no longer required to comply with zoning regulations. Receipt of a recorded copy of this document and plat shall be required prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the principal permitted use for which the off-site parking is to be utilized.
Section 1008. Shared Parking Facilities
Shared parking facilities are permitted as long as dedicated spaces are maintained or it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator that the patterns of use between the uses are so different as to permit the same spaces to count for more than one use. Any proposed shared parking arrangements shall be accompanied by notarized statements from all users and the owner that such arrangements are satisfactory and shall clearly indicate the total users of the parking area by demand and time of day and day of week for each user. At such time that the zoning administrator determines that the amount of parking is not adequate, adequate parking shall be installed in a time frame and in number as determined by the zoning administrator (but not to exceed the minimum parking requirements in
section 1006.D. - Minimum Off-street Parking Requirements For Permitted Uses), provided that all other provisions of the code are met.

Article 11. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
Section 1101. Purpose and Intent
Certain areas within the City of Myrtle Beach are subject to periodic inundation by flood waters which results or may reasonably be foreseen to result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These hazards are caused by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses which are vulnerable to floods because they are inadequately elevated or not otherwise protected from flood damage. Therefore, it is the intent of this ordinance to lessen such hazards and losses by restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood; by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood hazards at the time of initial construction; and by controlling filling, grading, alteration of natural protective barriers, placing of obstructions or other activities, uses, or characteristics of use which may increase flood damage.
1101.A. Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health; to minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; to minimize prolonged business interruptions; to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electrical, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplains; to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and, to insure that potential buyers are notified that a property is in a floodplain.
1101.B. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted with such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Myrtle Beach or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
1101.C. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State law. This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and other conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 196
Article 11. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
Section 1102. Definitions Specific to Floodplain Management
The definitions in this part supplement those given in Article 2 - Definitions of the Ordinance, but are intended to apply only to the floodplain management regulations.
Accessory structure: Structure which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and storage sheds are common accessory structures.

Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement area is not considered a buildings lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this ordinance.
197
Article 11. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include recreational vehicles.
Manufactured home park or subdivision: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
Manufactured home park or subdivision, existing: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for serving the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before December 11, 1990.
Manufactured home park or subdivision, new: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for serving the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after December 11, 1990.
New construction: Any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after July 5, 1977.
Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:
a) Built on a single chassis;
b) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
c) Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a vehicle no larger than a light duty truck; and
d) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Start of construction: The first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. The "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation.
Structure: Anything constructed, erected or established on and at least six inches (6) above the ground, including but not without limiting the generality of the following: buildings, signs, sea walls, trailers, fences, and patio walls.
Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of reconstructing the structure to its condition immediately before damage would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure immediately before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement: Any improvement of a structure, whether it is an addition, rehabilitation, or reconstruction, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market 198
Article 11. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
value of the structure immediately before the improvement is started. In the case where more than one improvement is made over time, the percentage value (that is, the value of the improvement expressed as a percentage of the value of the structure immediately before the improvement) of the most recent improvement shall be added to the percentage value of all other improvements made within the previous 10 years; and if that cumulative percentage equals or exceeds a total of 50 percent, then it shall be classified as a substantial improvement.
Note: For example, if an owner of a house valued at $100,000.00 makes a $20,000.00 improvement, that is, a 20 percent improvement, then five years from now, when the house is valued at $150,000.00, the owner may make an improvement of just under $45,000.00 in value-that is, an improvement that cost slightly less than the equivalent of 30 percent of the then current market value of the house-without exceeding the 50 percent maximum that defines the cumulative improvements as being a substantial improvement: 20 percent improvements now + 30 percent improvement five years from now. Similarly, if the value of the house five years from now has fallen to $90,000.00, the owner could make an improvement of just under $27,000.00, which is 30 percent of the value of the house when the new improvement is to be made.
For the purposes of these floodplain regulations, the market value shall be the assessed value as determined by a licensed real estate appraiser or by the Horry County Tax Assessor; at the discretion of the property owner.
For the purposes of these floodplain management regulations, any improvement of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural member of a structure, whether or not that improvement affects the external dimensions of the structure, shall be included when determining a substantial improvement has been made. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure shall not be included in determining if a substantial improvement has been made.
Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.
Section 1103. Adoption of Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Maps
1103.A. Federal Insurance Administration. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for Horry County, South Carolina, and Incorporated Areas," effective September 17, 2003, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood hazard boundary maps and any revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. These maps divide the City of Myrtle Beach into zones, each having specific flood potential or hazard. Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study for the unincorporated areas of Horry County, with accompanying map and other data are adopted by reference and declared part of this ordinance.
199
Article 11. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
1103.B. Use of Best Available Data. Data from preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best available data from a federal, state or other source. Data must be developed using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP approved models. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data does not have to be used.
Section 1104. Floodplain Management Regulations Established as Supplementary
The flood insurance zone designations established by this ordinance are not intended to be utilized as separate zoning district classifications, but as designations which identify areas subject to regulations which are supplementary to the regulations of the zoning district to which such designations are attached, appended, or "overlaid." Regulations which apply to areas designated on the flood insurance rate map as being within such appended or overlaid designations must be determined by joint reference to the regulations of both the basic district classification and the appended or overlay classification.
Section 1105. General Requirements
Within those areas of the municipality designated as special flood hazard areas by the flood insurance rate map, the following general requirements must be met:
1105.A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Ordinance concerning the reconstruction of any non-conforming structure which is located in a special flood hazard area and which is located in a special flood hazard area and which sustains substantial damage, regardless of the value of the reconstruction, shall comply with all requirements for substantial improvement in these floodplain regulations.
1105.B. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
1105.C. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
1105.D. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
1105.E. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
1105.F. All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
1105.G. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

Article 11. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
1105.I. For any structure which is elevated no less than three feet above base flood elevation, the maximum building height requirement of the district where the structure is located, as found elsewhere in this ordinance, shall be relaxed so that a structure may extend no more than three feet above the maximum requirement. Such permission shall be within the authority of the zoning administrator and shall not require the property owner to request a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals. However, the relaxation of the height requirement of this subsection shall not apply to properties governed by section 1803 - Airport Hazard Zone For Myrtle Beach International Airport of this Ordinance (the airport hazard zoning regulations of the Myrtle Beach International Airport) to the extent that such relaxation does not comply with the provisions of section 1803 - Airport Hazard Zone For Myrtle Beach International Airport.
1105.J. A non-conversion agreement will be required of all new residential construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation. The non-conversion agreement must be registered with the Horry County Register of Deeds office, and a clocked copy must be returned to the City to be filed with the construction services department.

before dropping below the base flood elevation and has appropriate protection against erosion and scour, such design to be approved by a registered engineer, or be constructed on pilings which meet the engineered support requirements of section 1111  Development of Coastal High Hazard (VE) Zones.
1110.E. Requirements for floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 1103 are areas designated as floodways (see Article 2 - Definitions). Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and which have erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Prohibited in floodways are encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. If section 1110.E.1 - Prohibited In Floodways is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 11  Floodplain Management Regulations.
3. The placement and replacement of manufactured homes and substantial improvements to existing manufactured homes shall be prohibited in floodways.
Section 1111. Development of Coastal High Hazard (VE) Zones
Within those areas designated as Coastal High Hazard (VE) areas on the applicable FIRM, the following additional regulations shall apply to all new construction and substantial improvements:
1111.A. All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide.
1111.B. All buildings or structures shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated no less than three feet above the base flood level; and the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval). A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specification and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of 1111.E  Breakaway Wall. In addition, the space below the lowest floor shall be free of obstructions or be constructed with breakaway walls.
1111.C. If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be utilized only for building access, parking, or limited storage. 206
Article 11. FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
1111.D. No improvements to a structure shall enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway walls are used.
1111.E. For the purposes of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:
1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
2. The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).
Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage.
1111.F. There shall be no fill used as structural support. Limited non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating loading forces, ramping effects or wave deflection. Only beach compatible sand may be used. The local administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
1. Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction;
2. Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and,
3. Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
1111.G. There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage.
1111.H. The placement and replacement of manufactured homes and substantial improvements to existing manufactured homes shall be prohibited in Coastal High Hazard (VE) zones.
Section 1112. Development of 500-year Floodplains

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided the above items have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification require for issuing the variance increases.
3. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
4. Conditions of variances.
a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
b. Variances shall only be issued upon:
i. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
ii. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
iii. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety, result in extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation at a specified number of feet below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
1114.C. Procedures for requesting amendments to the flood insurance rate maps: Requests for amending the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) may be submitted by affected individuals directly to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The City of Myrtle Beach has no authority to amend or grant variances to the flood insurance rate maps without prior approval of the Federal Insurance Administration.

Section 1401. Establishment of Zoning Districts
All areas within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Myrtle Beach are hereby divided into zoning districts. Each general use district category serves a different purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and restrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on all land or uses within the zoning jurisdiction. A general use district may be layered with an overlay district, which is a special type of general use district. Within each district the use of land and water areas; the location, height, bulk, appearance and use of structures; the provision of parking and loading areas; and the provision of buffers and screening areas are regulated as herein provided. The purpose of the use districts established herein is:
1401.A. To group together into several zones those uses that are reasonably compatible with one another according to their normal characteristics of operation;
1401.B. To permit in connection with these uses those customary and necessary accessory activities which are incidental to the permitted use; and
1401.C. To permit certain other uses that may be established in some situations and subject to specific conditions so that such special uses will also be compatible with the uses allowed as a matter of right.

Said official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and shall bear the seal of the City under the words "Official Zoning Map, City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina", along with the date of adoption.
Each individual map amendment adopted by City Council shall be interpreted as authorizing the preparation and printing of a revised Zoning Map to reflect this change and shall also amend the date of adoption of the official Zoning Map.
The official Zoning Map shall be located in the office of the zoning administrator and shall be interpreted as including all map amendments approved by the City Council since the adoption of the most recent official Zoning Map, whether or not they are actually portrayed on the printed copy. The official Zoning Map shall be the final authority as to the current zoning designation of the land, water areas, buildings, structures and other uses in the City, notwithstanding any other official Zoning Map purported to be a copy of the official Zoning Map.
Section 1404. Change of City Boundaries
All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City of Myrtle Beach shall automatically be zoned Single-family (R15) district unless otherwise specified by ordinance.

Article 14. ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
1407.D Uses permitted in the Arts & Innovation (ART) District.
Purpose & Intent. The intent of the Arts and Innovation District is to create and sustain a walkable mixed-use urban environment that will serve as the hub of artistic, cultural and civic life in the traditional core of downtown Myrtle Beach. As a year-round destination for both residents and visitors, the districts primary uses are supported by a wide range of businesses that help to maintain a vibrant atmosphere. This is further supported by the active use of outdoor spaces for dining and entertainment, and the development of upper-story residences in mixed-use buildings.
Unlike the other zoning districts listed in section 1407.C, uses are permitted in the ART District in the following categories. Examples are provided for explanatory purposes and are not intended as complete lists. A mix of categories and uses sharing spaces is permitted. Classification within the categories will be determined by the Zoning Administrator unless the use is explicitly listed. Innovation within the categories is encouraged.
In general:
1. All non-residential uses will be closed for business between the hours of 12 AM and 6 AM.
2. No drive-through windows are permitted.
Use Categories:
Multifamily residential dwelling units and amenities, provided that no permanent dwelling units fronting on the rights-of-way of Oak St, Main St, Broadway St, 8th Ave N, 9th Ave N, Kings Hwy, or Hwy 501 are permitted at ground level.
Offices, including but not limited to accounting, advertising, law, architects, real estate, finance, engineering, government offices, shared office spaces

Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
Section 1701. Purpose, Intent and Applicability
In order to insure that new development, renovations, and reconstructions are designed, sized, and sited to complement the area in which they are located and the character of the City in general; and to minimize traffic hazards and situations which endanger public safety; and to protect existing development and property values through the promotion of high standards of design and compatibility; and to provide for a high quality of life for our citizens by promoting a variety of housing styles, transportation choices, and well planned parks and open spaces; the following standards are hereby adopted.
Section 1702. Design Standards for all Zoning Districts
The following shall apply to all development in all zoning districts unless otherwise noted.
1702.A. Buildings.
1. Minimum Finished Floor Elevation.
a. All structures, except for garages or residential accessory structures less than six hundred square feet in size, that are not located in a special flood hazard area, shall have the lowest floor and all mechanical or electrical equipment, such as compressors, air conditioning units, etc., elevated no less than eighteen inches above the highest crown of any abutting street or catch basin, or at the owners option, twenty-four inches above the average grade of the lot, except when designed by a civil engineer to prevent flooding and sewer backup. Final site grading shall insure that ponding of stormwater will not occur beneath the building nor nearer than three feet from the building's perimeter or any mechanical or electrical equipment.
b. All existing structures that are not in a special flood hazard area will be permitted to expand at the existing finished floor elevation.
2. Setback Exceptions.
a. Nonconforming Lots. The owner of an existing lot which does not conform to the minimum dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located, and which does not contain sufficient land to meet side and rear yard requirements without reducing the building area below 40 percent of the total lot area, may nonetheless build upon the lot provided that:
i. Minimum side and rear yard requirements shall be reduced by no more than 30 percent.
ii. The percentage reduction may be no greater than that required to bring the buildable area up to 40% of the total lot area.
iii. This exception shall not apply to the rear or side lot setback requirements of commercial properties abutting residential uses in any Residential (R, RM and residential PUD) or Mixed Use (MU) district.

Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
330
Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
b. Corner Lots. Where the rear of a corner lot (with both front and side street frontage) abuts the side of an interior lot (with frontage on only one street), the side-street setback for the corner lot shall never be less than 50% of the front street setback of the interior lot to which it abuts.
c. Double Frontage. On lots having frontage on more than one street but not located on a corner, the minimum front yard requirements for the district within which the lot is located shall be applicable for each street on which the lot fronts, except where otherwise specified.
d. Orientation Change. When it is decided to change the orientation of a building to face the side street rather than the originally planned facing of the corner lot, then the front yard requirement shall apply to both streets. The facing of the main entrance door determines the building front (i.e. the street to which the door is parallel). When oriented to the side street the newly required front yard does not change the location of the other side yard or the rear year. They are determined by the zoning orientation of the lot (see Article 2  Definitions for definition of lot, corner).
331
Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
e. No Minimum Setbacks. Where side and rear yard setbacks are not required but are provided, the building setback shall be a minimum distance of five feet from the property line.
f. Fences, walls or hedges. A solid fence, wall or hedge may project into or enclose required yards in all zones provided that maximum height, excluding posts and other structural components and excluding hedges in single family districts, as measured from grade at the fence, wall or hedge averaged across the length of the fence, wall or hedge does not exceed the following:
i. Required front yards--4 feet; fences may exceed 4 feet provided that of any such excess height of the fence, the visibility through it shall not be less than 50 percent and shall be equally apportioned in the entire length of any such fence. The maximum height of any such fence shall not exceed 5 feet.
ii. Required side yards--6 feet
iii. Required rear yards--8 feet
iv. All yards for oceanfront lots -- 4 feet. Fences on oceanfront lots may exceed 4 feet on the sides and front, provided that of any such excess height of the fence, the visibility through it shall not be less than 50 percent and shall be equally apportioned in the entire length of any such fence. The maximum height of any such fence shall not exceed 5 feet.
v. Posts and other structural components may extend an additional 12 above the height limits of i-iv above.
All fences are to be of similar appearance on both sides of the fence. All structural support features of a fence or wall which make a side dissimilar from the other side must be placed on the interior side of such wall or fence.
g. Swimming pools or pool enclosure setbacks (except in the Institutional (IN) district. See 1710 Design Standards for the Institutional District):
Front or side street: 15 feet
Side or rear yard: 10 feet

349
Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
located in Highway Commercial (HC) zoning districts must follow the street and parking design standards defined below:
1. Street design standards.
a. Streets and alleys shall. whenever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to existing and projected streets outside the development. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 150 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external connectivity. shall be permanently terminated by vehicular turnarounds of various configurations adequate for emergency access.
b. The average perimeter of all blocks within the development should not exceed 2.000 feet. No block face should have a length greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access. An exception to this requirement may occur where limited access rights-of-way abut the development and the abutting premises are served by a parallel internal street.
c. A continuous network of rear alleys is recommended for all lots; rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots less than 60 feet in width.
d. Utilities shall be underground, and run along alleys whenever possible.
e. Streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size. capacity. and design speed; streets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated on the submitted plan. Each street type shall be separately detailed. Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements will be considered to allow neighborhood streets designs that are appropriate to siting and use.
f. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long uninterrupted segments of straight streets shall be avoided. Methods shall include one or more of the following:
i. A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and terminate at vistas with a significant feature (building, park. natural feature).
ii. A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building façade, or a gateway to the ensuing space.
iii. Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is bounded by a building or other vertical element that hugs the curve to deflect the view.
iv. Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.
2. Pedestrian walkways. Pedestrian walkways shall form an on-site circulation system that minimizes the conflict between pedestrians and traffic at all points of pedestrian access to on-site parking and building entrances. Pedestrianwalkways shall provide direct connections from building entrances to sidewalksalong streets and to existing or planned transit stops. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided when the pedestrian access point or anv parking space is more than 75 feet from the building entrance or principal on-site destination as follows:
a. All developments which contain more than one building shall provide walkways between the principal entrances of the buildings; and
b. All nonresidential buildings set back 100 feet or more from the public right-of-way shall provide for direct pedestrian access from the building to buildings on adjacent lots.

Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
3. Outparcels. When an approved site plan includes outparcels, construction upon which are included in a later phase, the future outparcel sites shall be planted with grass prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any use on site.
1715.C. Outdoor display of Heavy Durable Goods is not allowed on lots less than five (5) acres.
Section 1716. Design Standards for the Arts & Innovation (ART) District.
Purpose & Intent. The intent of the Arts and Innovation District is to create and sustain a walkable mixed-use urban environment that will serve as the hub of artistic, cultural and civic life in the traditional core of downtown Myrtle Beach. As a year-round destination for both residents and visitors, the districts primary uses are supported by a wide range of businesses that help to maintain a vibrant atmosphere. Building design is in harmony with the character of the area and establishes a continuity of pedestrian-oriented frontages between adjacent buildings. This is further supported by pedestrian oriented urban design, the active use of outdoor space for dining and entertainment, encouraging the development of upper-story residences in mixed-use buildings, and the incorporation of both active and passive public spaces throughout the district.
1716.A Newly constructed buildings shall have a minimum of two occupiable stories above grade.
1716.B Awnings, roofs, or other creative structures may extend over the public sidewalk, provided that they do not extend beyond the back edge of the curb line or more than a distance of 8 over the sidewalk; and further provided the roof maintains a minimum 9 clearance from grade; and further provided that the roof does not rely on public property for structural support nor interfere with pedestrian traffic.
1716.B.Where applicable, the first floor shall have a minimum interior height of 14 feet as measured from the finished floor elevation of the ground floor to the bottom of the floor plate of the second floor.
1716.C. Side and rear walls shall be improved and maintained in harmony with the primary façade. The development of rear or side entrances is encouraged where appropriate.
1716.D. Scale and Proportion: The width and general proportions of a building shall conform generally to other buildings in the district. Ratio of wall surface to openings and the ratio of the width and height of windows and doors shall be consistent with the district. Buildings shall remain pedestrian-scaled in order to protect views, sunlight and street character.
351
Article 17. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
As seen in the illustration above, the rhythm of the buildings is established by the variety that is created between window sizes and spacing, the amount of wall area that is visible, and the placement of details.
1716.E. Storefronts:
1. A minimum of 70% of the building wall between a height of 2 feet and 10 feet above grade shall be composed of transparent glass.
2. Storefront doors shall be recessed from the public sidewalk a minimum of 3 feet.
1716.F. Windows shall not be tinted, mirrored, or covered with materials in such a way that obstructs the view of the interior space. Creative merchandise window displays are encouraged, provided the background is not opaque and provided displays contain no flashing or strobe lighting or any signage.
1716.G.When historic tax credits are utilized, US Department of Interior and SC Department of Archives and History design requirements supersede the requirements of section 1716.
1716.H. No property shall be subdivided into a flag lot.

Article 18. OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
Section 1801. Purpose and Intent
A base zoning classification, as described in Article 14  Zoning Districts and Map, regulates all lands in the City. Properties within the City may also be subject to additional regulations provided by one of the overlay zones included in this Article. Overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements, to permit uses not otherwise permitted in the underlying district, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district, or to establish special development requirements for uses permitted. Where an overlay zone regulates land, the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to those required in the base zoning district. Where overlay districts exist and there is a conflict between the requirements and/or uses specified between the overlay and the underlying district, the regulations of the overlay district shall prevail. A Zoning Map change either establishing or changing any overlay district shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as any other Zoning Map change.
1801.A. Branding Overlay Zones. Overlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning districts, and may grant additional use or development requirements upon the underlying zoning districts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the use and development of a lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support specific public policy objectives and should be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Overlay districts may be applied to all districts and across district lines. An overlay district may be initiated as an amendment by the City Council, City Manager. Planning Commission, Planning Department or not less than 50% of the property owners in a defined area for the purposes of branding.
The City Council herein establishes a process by ordinance by which one (1) or more overlay districts pursuant to this section may be created to provide additional regulations for design standards and development within any area of the city determined to be an area that has a unique commercial, historical, architectural, natural, or cultural significance that is suitable for enhancement, branding, preservation or conservation.
Application Requirements: In consideration of a complete application, the Planning Director and the Planning Commission may require any or all of the following information and any other materials as may be deemed necessary for its review:
 Statement, photographs and maps relating to existing zoning and proposed overlay, and its relationship to the surrounding property and/or the corridor on which it is located.
 Site plan drawings and other exhibits showing the location of the existing or proposed building and site improvements, including:
o existing property boundaries, building placement and site configuration,
o location of existing parking, pedestrian access, signage, exterior lighting, fencing and other site improvements,
o relationship to adjacent land uses,
o proposed site improvements, including location of parking, pedestrian access, signage, exterior lighting, fencing, buildings and structures and other appurtenant elements, proposed building color and materials,
o relationship of building and site elements to existing and planned corridor development and
354
Article 18. OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
o relationship of parking, pedestrian facilities, and vehicular access ways to existing and planned corridor development.
o other site plans and subdivision plats as may be required by Planning Director and Planning Commission for its recommendation.
 A landscaping and buffer plan.
 A signage plan addressing designs for exterior signing, lighting and graphics, to include description of materials, colors placement and means of physical support, lettering style and message to be placed on signs.
Upon the establishment of an overlay district, development within the area shall conform to all zoning regulations applicable to the area and all overlay district regulations.
An ordinance establishing an overlay district shall, at a minimum, include the following provisions:
1. An accurate description of the boundaries of the district;
2. A description of the commercial, historical, architectural, cultural, aesthetic, natural, or other distinctive characteristics of the district that are to be preserved or conserved;
3. The standards, guidelines, or criteria that shall govern development within the district to preserve, conserve, or protect the historical, architectural, cultural, aesthetic, commercial or other distinctive characteristics of the district. These standards, guidelines, or criteria may be set out descriptively in the ordinance or by illustration, and may incorporate by reference established architectural standards or guidelines.
Section 1802. CP Coastal Protection Overlay Zone
1802.A. Purpose of District. The purpose of the CP coastal protection zone is to provide supplementary regulations for oceanfront property seaward of the projected 50 year erosion control line to control erosion, preserve and maintain a recreational beach, safeguard property and promote public safety, while acknowledging the public benefit and historic location of pier structures on deeded pier lots located approximately at 14th Avenue North, 2nd Avenue North and 54th Avenue North. Further, it is the intent of this section to promote the retreat of buildings, structures and other improvements located on non-pier lots from the CP district or as far landward in the district as possible. Except for the piers on pier lots, if retreat is not possible, it is intended that existing buildings may be replaced without exceeding the gross square footage of the existing building and without any portion of the footprint of the building located in the CP district being exceeded.

the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet, to a height of 350 feet above the established airport elevation or 380 feet above mean sea level (NGVD).
3. Primary Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specifically prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is that width prescribed in Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The elevation of the primary surface for the Myrtle Beach International Airport is 30 feet above mean sea level (NGVD)
4. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway. The inner edge of this approach surface is the same width as the primary surface. The approach surface expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet. The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to 1 to a height of 200 feet above the established airport elevation or 230 feet above mean sea level (NGVD); with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40 to 1 to a height of 1200 feet above the established airport elevation or 1230 feet above mean sea level (NGVD).
5. Transitional Surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary surface to the horizontal surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces to the conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway surface.
1803.F. Height Limitations. In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the horizontal surfaces, conical surfaces, primary surfaces, precision instrument approach surfaces and transitional surfaces as they apply to the Myrtle Beach International Airport. No structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained to or at a height in excess of the height of any of the following zones. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any vegetation or structure to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this ordinance the datum shall be mean sea level (NGVD) elevation unless otherwise specified. In any zone covered by more than one height restriction, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. Airport elevation is 30 feet above mean sea level:
1. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone.
The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two thousand (2,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal 360
Article 18. OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the primary surface and extends at a slope upward one (1) foot vertically for each fifty (50) feet horizontally beginning at the end of and at the same elevation of the primary surface. The centerline of the zone is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (Note: the approach ratio of horizontal to vertical 50:1 exists in the immediate vicinity closest to the ends of the runway surfaces. From the conical zone outward, the approach ratio is then 40:1.)
Height limitation: (50:1) Slopes upward one (1) foot vertically for each fifty (50) feet horizontally beginning at the end of an at the same elevation of the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet, and thereafter extending at the same height for an additional distance of twenty-five thousand (25,000) feet. Structures shall not exceed fifty (50) feet in elevation above ground level or eighty (80) feet above mean sea level, whichever is less, within the area from the ends of the primary surface runways to the limit of the horizontal surface zone. Structures shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet in elevation above ground level or one hundred thirty (130) feet above mean sea level, whichever is less, within the area beginning at the horizontal surface zone (extended from the primary surface centerline of Runway 18) to the limit of the approach surface a distance of forty thousand (40,000) feet inland.
2. Transition Zones. (7:1) Slopes upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zone, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach zone, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Structures shall not exceed fifty (50) feet elevation above ground level or eighty (80) feet elevation above mean sea level.
3. Inner Horizontal Zone. One hundred and fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation. Unless determined not to be an airport obstruction or hazard by the FAA and the Horry County Director of Airports, structures shall not exceed one hundred forty-nine (149) feet in elevation above ground level or one hundred seventy-nine (179) feet above mean sea level, whichever is less. In the event a determination is made that a structure may exceed this height limitation, required documentation must accompany any permit application for construction.
4. Conical Zone. (20:1) Slopes upward and outward twenty (20) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the inner horizontal zone and at 150 (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. Unless determined not to be an airport obstruction or hazard by the FAA and the Horry County Director of Airports, structures shall not exceed one hundred forty-nine (149) feet in elevation above ground level (airport elevation) or one hundred seventy-nine (179) feet above mean sea level, whichever is less.

Article 18. OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
Myrtle Beach, or any combination thereof as well as the South Atlantic Bank branch. The intent of the district is to showcase the area associated with the Myrtle Beach schools. Meetings were held with stakeholders, including school staff, school district staff, and members of the Myrtle Beach Cluster K-5 School Improvement Council. There was a strong desire on the part of all stakeholders to support the creation of a district to recognize the significance of the Seahawks in the community.
The Seahawk District is unique in that it contains Myrtle Beach's Primary, Elementary, Intermediate, Middle, and High Schools on a shared urban campus. They all use the Seahawk as their mascot, so there is a collective pride in the area tied to the schools as well as the athletic facilities which serve a host of athletic and special events outside of those sponsored by the schools. They City of Myrtle Beach's Pepper Geddings Recreational facility is there, as well as the Grand Strand Miracle League's James C. Benton Field.
The desires expressed by many of the stakeholders is that the ideas enumerated in this ordinance can be designed and implemented to be consistent with various school designs, while creating a contiguous unifying theme. Safety is also an overarching theme, with all consideration being made to maintain the safety of the children attending the schools.
1806.B. The standards, guidelines, or criteria governing development within the Seahawk District to preserve, conserve, protect, and/or enhance the commercial, historical, architectural, cultural aesthetic, natural and/or other distinctive characteristics of that Seahawk District.

Section 1807. OCEAN BOULEVARD ENTERTAINMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (OBEOD)
1807.A Purpose and intent. The City of Myrtle Beach finds that:
1. Without debate, the City's economic engine is tourism.
2. Sustaining tourism is essential to maintain our standard of living, the funding of our amenities for our citizens and for the preservation of property values.
3. Tourism is threatened by perceived unseemliness or unsafety in any particular area.
4. The perception of unseemliness or unsafety is, to large degree, a product of atmosphere.
5. The atmosphere of a location is comprised of many factors, one of which is whether a location is suitable and safe for children, and families.
6. One component of atmosphere for a location is the proliferation of retail offerings of businesses in that area, that are not family attractive.
7. Certain retail offerings create an atmosphere that is repulsive to mothers and fathers in the care of their children, in that retail outlets are promoting crudity and sexually explicit apparel, drug paraphernalia, and consumables that mimic and promote drug and substance consumption.
8. The purpose of the Ocean Boulevard Entertainment Overlay District (OBEOD) is to establish a family friendly entertainment and retail land use, and encourage compatible land uses, ensure higher quality development and business uses and function in order to protect property values and provide safe and efficient pedestrian and automobile access.
9. These retail restrictions and criteria can encourage quality development and economic growth while continuing to provide for a wide range of economic development opportunities throughout the City for those uses which are incompatible with the OBEOD.
10. The displacement of CBD consumables, smoke shops and tobacco stores is necessary and in the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare because there is the substantial likelihood of the establishment and operation of 368
Article 18. OVERLAY ZONE REGULATIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
expanded retail offerings of CBD consumables, smoke shops and tobacco stores in the OBEOD.
11. The continued operation and expansion of these family adverse retail offerings in the overlay would result in undesirable impacts to the public economy of the overlay.
12. Among these impacts are increased potential for CBD consumables and tobacco sales to minors, greater opportunity for the sale of illegal drug paraphernalia that is marketed as tobacco paraphernalia, and heightened risk of negative aesthetic impacts, blight, and loss of property values of residential neighborhoods and businesses in close proximity to such uses.
13. This overlay contains amendments consistent with good zoning and planning practices to address such negative impacts of smoke shops and tobacco stores while providing a reasonable number of locations and zones for such shops/ stores to locate within the city of Myrtle Beach.
14. The OBEOD is intended to encourage mixed-use within the same structure or block and/or high intensity commercial development, which provides a wide array of entertainment and retail options, without the current family unfriendly environment promoting unhealthy tobacco use, crudity and the stigma of drug use and paraphernalia.
15. In the event of a conflict between the entitlements, regulations or standards established in the OBEOD, and the equivalent provisions in the underlying zoning districts, the provisions of the OBEOD shall govern.
16. Families are the center of all communities, the building blocks of our city and the basis of a sustained tourism economy. The Council is determined to see a "family friendly lens" placed over all policies, strategies and initiatives undertaken and supported by the Council.
1807.B Boundaries. The boundaries of the OBEOD are as indicated in the attachment to Ordinance 2017-23 as shown below:

1902.A. Intent. It is the intent of this section that Sustainability & Conservation Developments are:
1. To preserve and protect important natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, and woodlands for natural flood control, filtration of pollutants, habitat for wildlife, and natural beauty; and
2. To promote a sustainable development tool that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of land; and
3. To permit clustering of structures in a compact development pattern, which will reduce the amount of necessary infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility connections; and
4. To reduce erosion and sedimentation of nearby streams and other bodies of water by minimizing land disturbance and removal of existing vegetation in close proximity thereof; and
5. To promote the creation of an interconnected parks and open space system within developed and undeveloped areas of Myrtle Beach and Horry County for citizens to enjoy and for wildlife to survive; and
6. To promote the interconnectivity of developments within and amongst neighboring communities, businesses and facilities through walking trails and bike paths to reduce the reliance on automobiles; and
7. To encourage social interaction in the community by clustering buildings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places, encouraging use of traffic calming features, and creating parks and community facilities that serve as focal points; and
8. To encourage complete street designs to better foster more human-scale environments including energy-efficient and healthy travel choices such as cycling and walking; and
9. To protect scenic views and reduce perceived density in popular viewsheds by clustering the dwelling units in neighborhoods with direct access to and view of the open spaces; and respectfully 374
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
10. To preserve important historic and archeological sites such as cemeteries.
1902.B. Applicability. The Sustainability & Conservation Development Option is allowed in any new subdivision in any district that allows residential uses, provided the provisions of this section are followed.
1902.C. Ownership of Development Site. The tract of land to be developed may be held in single or multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownerships, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
1902.D. Lot Density Determination. Lots within Sustainability & Conservation Developments are not subject to minimum lot width, lot frontage, or lot area, but the subdivision, nonetheless, must be approved by the Planning Commission. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations. The following shall not be included in the net buildable acreage of the involved land parcel:
1. Floodways, identified with AF on the latest FEMA floodplain maps for Myrtle Beach;
2. Perennial and intermittent watercourses as well as bodies of open water over five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area;
3. Jurisdictional Wetlands that meet the definition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act;
4. Existing and proposed rights-of-way for roads, utilities and other basic infrastructure needs.
1902.E. Basic Development Standards. The Sustainability & Conservation Development concept is intended to encourage green building and master planning that incorporates conservation of a substantial percentage of existing natural resource areas into the overall development site to the benefits of the natural environment, residents, and overall quality of life. In order to attain the maximum density ratio in accordance to underlying zoning as established through the density calculation set forth in section 1902.D  Lot Density Determination, the Sustainability & Conservation Development is based on the idea of accommodating its development into sustainable neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the increased density in these developments shall not visibly intrude into the character of the surrounding area nor shall the overall development negatively impair any wetlands or floodplains.
1. Unless otherwise stated below, or incentivized in section 1902.F - Incentives, dimensional and parking requirements are as specified in the zoning district in which the development is located.
Minimum Access Easement to Open Space
15
Minimum Open Space Required
As required in the zoning district in which the 375
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
development is located, or 40% of gross land area, whichever is greater.
2. Specific Open Space Requirements:
a. Definition  Open Space within a Sustainability & Conservation Development is the portion of land that is to be set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved Open Space Management Plan and/or any instrument of permanent protection as approved under section 1902.G.  Application Process Step IV.
b. Minimum Open Space Area  The Minimum Open Space Required in section 1902.E.1 - Dimensional and Parking Requirements shall be left undeveloped and shall be used for both conservation of the natural environment and human recreation. Protected features within the mandatory Open Space Area may include:
i. The regulatory 100-year floodplain;
ii. Significant or sensitive wetlands considered not under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE);
iii. Intermittent and perennial watercourses and other bodies of water;

vii. Protected and landmark trees;
viii. Tree clusters;
ix. Other significant features of the local environment (e.g. Carolina Bays, old dune systems);
x. Scenic viewsheds, particularly those that can be seen from a public road, river, beach or other publically accessible area;
xi. Agricultural lands and soils of statewide importance (as indicated by the USDA).
1902.F. Incentives. The following incentives may be applied for and pursued by the sustainability & conservation developer. However, in no case shall the overall development density exceed a factor of 1.2 of the by-right development density as determined by the zoning district in which the S&C Development is located.
1. Water Ways and Wetland Protection Buffers: Vegetated (native vegetation only) buffer zones with a width of at least 50, measured from the top of bank, shall be preserved around all existing wetland and riparian areas (as indicated on the Site Analysis Map) to protect water quality, reduce flood hazards by providing natural floodwater retention areas, and to conserve sensitive fauna and flora habitat. Land development and removal of vegetation shall be prohibited within protection buffers, except:
a. Roadway, driveway, and utility crossings that are the minimum necessary to allow for the development; 376
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
b. Recreational pathways, greenways, and other passive recreational access that shall incorporate design features to minimize impervious cover.
c. Temporary erosion and sediment control practices should be located outside the buffer unless absolutely necessary;
d. Selective thinning of low-hanging limbs and underbrush to allow scenic views, but tree destruction is prohibited and at least 50% of the tree canopy and understory shall be maintained at all times; and
e. Stream and wetland restoration projects.
It is permissible for the land developer to utilize the instrument of buffer averaging to adjust the overall required buffer width of 50 while at the same time allowing design flexibility. If the development property includes both sides of a river, steam or linear watercourse the required buffer is intended to be provided on both sides.
?? Incentive: One (1) additional multifamily dwelling unit per 3,000 sq.ft. of provided buffer area, provided, however, that no incentive shall be provided for any wetland buffers required as compensatory mitigation pursuant to a Clean Water Act, Section 404 permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for wetland impacts.
2. Trails and Open Space Connectivity: The provision of open space and multi-use trail interconnectivity between the proposed development and adjacent communities and existing open spaces, parks and/or trails shall be provided to an overall benefit to the health of citizens and wildlife alike.
?? Incentive: Reduction in required side yard setback to zero (0) feet to allow for zero-lot developments, provided, however, that consent by the adjacent property owner to the zero setback and any necessary maintenance easements is obtained and recorded with the office of the Register of Mesne Conveyance for Horry County, and that the overall stormwater plan shall comply with the stormwater management ordinance and construction general permit.
3. Additional Provision of Open Space: The provision of any additional acreage of natural open space area above the minimum required in section 1902.E.1 - Dimensional and Parking Requirements.
?? Incentive: One (1) additional multifamily dwelling unit for every (0.5) acre of additionally provided open space.
377
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
4. Low-Impact-Development (Nonstructural Stormwater Management Practices): Low- Impact-Development (L.I.D.) is a common expression for nonstructural stormwater measures that can be easily incorporated into any development site design to optimize the lands ability to locally absorb stormwater, thus capturing pollutants on-site and preventing major environmental impacts downstream. Low-Impact-Development practices, such as bioretention swales, raingardens, porous pavers, vegetated buffers, green roofs, etc., mimic the natural hydrologic absorption functions by utilizing absorptive soils and local plant communities that increase localized retention and transpiration of excess precipitation. L.I.D. may result in cost benefits for the developer, such as less required stormwater infrastructure, irrigation water savings, better aesthetics, and better insulation through green roofs. Although L.I.D. practices are encouraged for their additional water quality benefits, the overall stormwater plan shall comply with the stormwater management ordinance and construction general permit. All proposed L.I.D. features shall be illustrated on the applicants or developers plat.
?? Incentive: One (1) additional multifamily dwelling unit per 1 acre of impervious area of locally treated stormwater runoff from added L.I.D. features.
5. Native Landscaping/Xeriscaping: Landscaping by the use of either indigenous plants or trees recommended in the Community Tree Planting Plan for Myrtle Beach, South Carolina that are suitable to the local soil, topographic, climatic and hydrological conditions of Myrtle Beach and which greatly reduce irrigation demands. All regulations of Article 9 - Landscaping and Tree Protection shall be adhered to.
?? Incentive: One (1) additional multifamily dwelling unit per 0.5 acre of natively landscaped area, including the utilization of rain harvesting and/or water recycling for irrigation.
6. Affordable Housing: Provision of a certain percentage of dwelling units that meet the definition of Affordable Housing in Article 2 - Definitions. All affordable dwelling units shall be interspersed with the market-sold dwelling units and shall be similarly equipped to avoid any negative stigmatization and geographic segregation of eligible residents.
?? Incentive: One (1) additional fair-market value multifamily dwelling unit per every one (1) affordable dwelling unit. In single-family Sustainability & Conservation Developments of 10 new single-family units or more, One (1) additional fair-market value single-family dwelling unit per every one (1) affordable dwelling unit.
7. Energy and Water Efficiency/Sustainable Construction Certification: There are many regional, national and international environmental ratings and certifications that have established sustainability and efficiency standards for buildings, site design and products. The South Carolina Energy Office has prepared a guide to provide better understanding of the most prominent green building programs in South Carolina. The main goal of this incentive is to reward implementation of the latest energy and water efficiency as well as sustainable building standards that will reduce the overall need for heating and cooling and water use. This can be achieved actively by installing innovative heating and cooling systems (e.g.
378
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
geothermal, photovoltaic, solar panels), by improving insulation to a point where heating or cooling losses can be reduced to a minimum (zero), by the installation of efficient plumbing fixtures and appliances, etc.
?? Incentive: Builder/Developer is eligible for a 10 increase in maximum allowed height of multifamily structures if all proposed structures can prove implementation of the latest energy and water efficiency standards in compliance with BOTH the latest energy efficient construction programs as part of The South Carolina Energy Offices Energy Efficient Construction Program (Green Home Program) AND the national energy and water efficiency standards as outlined in the USEPA Energy Star and Water Sense Programs. The builder/developer must provide copies of certification letters stating the implementation of the latest energy and water efficiency standards within the development through a State or Federal Energy Office or any other accredited non-governmental organization.

Section 1904. Kings Highway Mixed-Use Option
Properties fronting on Kings Highway (Highway 17 Business) that are zoned Highway Commercial (HC1 or HC2) may, at the discretion of the property owner, be developed in accordance with all of the rules and regulations of the Mixed Use  Medium Density District (MU-M). The regulations of the Highway Commercial Districts (HC1 or HC2) may not be combined with the regulations of the Mixed Use  Medium Density District (MU-M), the development in its entirety must utilize the regulations of one zone or the other.
Section 1905. Redevelopment District Zone (RDZ) (Floating Zone)
1905.A. Purpose and Intent.
1. The purpose of the redevelopment district (RDV) is to promote appropriate investment and development in areas that are underperforming economically, or that are in need of new development or are underdeveloped. New development would enhance and support the entire community by providing residences, accommodations, visitor amenities, amusements, retail and service industry job opportunities as well as convenient access to necessary goods and services to residents and visitors alike.
2. The RDV is intended to upgrade and improve the physical, social, and economic character of the area and to promote mixed-use developments. The RDV is intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that conform to community quality-of-life benchmarks and that achieve a high level of aesthetics, high-quality development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other community goals by:
a. Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict
application of zoning and development standards that were designed primarily for individual lots;
b. Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and design amenities;
c. Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same
development, including a mix of housing types, retail, start-up businesses, technological enterprises, lot sizes and densities;
d. Promoting quality urban and traditional neighborhood design and
environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take
advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses; and
e. Encouraging quality urban and traditional neighborhood design and
environmentally sensitive development by allowing increases in base densities or floor area ratios when such increases can be justified by superior design or the provision of additional amenities such as public open space.
1905.B. Location and applicability. The establishment of RDV district(s) shall constitute an amendment to the official zoning district map and text. Each RDV district
388
Article 19. DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
City of Myrtle Beach, SC ZONING ORDINANCE
shall be controlled by a RDV development plan and RDV agreement that are approved as part of the RDV district designation.
1905.C Definitions Applicable to RDZ.
Public improvements include, but are not limited to, streets, streetscapes, sidewalks,
utilities, parks, open and green spaces and public art.
Redevelopment plan or project means any approved and permitted work or undertaking by any individual or legal entity to prepare and execute to finality a redevelopment plan,
including the planning, survey and other preparatory work incident to a redevelopment
project, as well as the presentment and production costs of all plans to appropriate reviewing bodies, and the subsequent construction of new mixed use developments, or construction of new commercial buildings or structures, and concurrently enhancement of public improvements complementary or essential to the commercial redevelopment, in accordance with a redevelopment plan.
Redevelopment Area means a distinct contiguous area in which a combination of any
combination of four (4) or more of redevelopment factors act, in the judgment of City
Council, to suppress or stagnate economic and social development of commercial, residential or mixed uses.
1905.D Redevelopment Factors Which May Justify a RDZ include:
1. Aging of accommodations, but without historical designation;
2. Structure dilapidation;
3. Structure or land use obsolescence;
4. Structure deterioration;
5. Land uses incompatible with existing redevelopment or Comprehensive Plan;
6. Structure uses that have been declared a public nuisance, or have been subject to review as an unfit dwelling;
7. Concentrated density without adequate parking, or public transportation;
8. Illegal use of individual structures;
9. Derelict, vacant or boarded up structures;
10.Foreclosures;
11.Structures and land uses below minimum code standards;
12.Concentration of short or long term rental residential property in single family residential neighborhoods;
13.Overcrowding of structures and community facilities;
14.Excessive land coverage incompatible with open space needs;
15.Deleterious land use or layout in light of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
16.Depreciation of physical maintenance;
17.Assessment and tax delinquencies.
1905.E General Eligibility Criteria For RDZ.

Downtown Myrtle Beach Design Guidelines
Broadway, Entry and Civic Districts
Introduction
The image of a downtown is perceived through the design of its buildings and streetscape. Good design as a component of downtown redevelopment creates a working, growing and aesthetically pleasing business center. The economic vitality and values for which the downtown stands are reinforced and rekindled, and the image of downtown as the commercial and social heart of the city is solidified.
Improving the visual appearance of Downtown Myrtle Beach helps to make the area a fun place to visit, shop and dine. Appearance is as critical to the success of the area as economic performance, public participation, new businesses and parking.
Each individual building façade plays an important role in the makeup of Downtown. Storefronts, window displays, signs, color, awnings and architectural details all play an integral part in the successful design of individual buildings. Rehabilitating your personal segment of Downtown Myrtle Beach can be mind-boggling:
? What materials should I use?
? What colors are best?
? Is an awning appropriate?
? What kind of sign would look best?
395
4
Property owners or tenants who wish to improve their buildings should begin by assessing the current visual condition of the entire façade:
? How could storefront improvements relate to the entire visual impact of the building?
? How does the building relate to neighboring buildings?
? How will a storefront improvement relate to the upper portion of the building?
? What changes are needed to improve the appearance and integrity of the upper portion of the building?
So many questions, and each one leads to more! Fortunately, many of these questions can easily be answered within the contents of these design guidelines. While local building codes must be complied with, these guidelines can help take the guesswork out of your rehab or new construction project by providing you with examples of challenging areas and possible solutions. Paint, awnings, signs, windows and doors are just some of the areas where information is offered to assist you in your project.
The following pages offer ideas and requirements for renovation and new construction in our revitalizing downtown. Detailed guidelines are included for storefronts, entryways, signs, awnings, sidewalks, upper stories, rear façades, color schemes, building placement & dimensions, roof forms, parking areas and landscaping.
The goal of all building improvements should be to make each building the best possible expression of itself that it can be. These design guidelines will steer property owners, developers, tenants and design professionals through various improvement projects while keeping in mind that each building is unique. The guidelines are intended to suggest ways in which property and business owners can take advantage of the unique charm and history of Downtown Myrtle Beach.
Remember, City Code requires approval by the Community Appearance Board before issuance of all commercial building permits, sign permits and awning permits. Although the Community Appearance Board will be referring to these guidelines when making their decisions, adherence to these guidelines does not guarantee approval by the Board.

Architectural Style
The core of Downtown Myrtle Beach was built primarily in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Architects generally utilized two different architectural styles that blend together nicely in our coastal town. All renovations, improvements and new construction should visually blend with the architectural style of the surrounding buildings.
Mediterranean
The Mediterranean style is a unique adaptation of Spanish and Moorish architecture. The splendor of this architecture can still be enjoyed in the façade of the Chapin Building on Main Street. Elements include prominent main entries, courtyards, balconies, cross ventilation, loggias and towers. Materials include masonry, stucco and terra cotta. Colors are muted pastels and naturals.
397
6
Georgian
Typical Georgian structures are symmetrical with gabled roofs, often including dormers, although pyramidal and other roof forms were used. City Hall is a classic example of this formal and dignified style. Materials varied widely from wood to brick and stone. Entrances were emphasized and ornately decorated, with transoms or fanlights over the door and columns or pilasters (piers made to look like columns) frequently taking the form of one or two story porticoes (porches). Elements include a projecting façade, band course, pediment, cornice, modillion course, brick or stone quoin, and dormers. Classical details surround the windows and doors and cornices, columns, pilasters, and quoins (outside corners). Window elements include a double hung sash, muntin, keystone, splayed lintel and louvered shutters. Materials include brick stone, plaster and wood.
Renovation
Consistency in design and proportion is important in conveying how our downtown is perceived by the customer seeking goods and services. The integrity of a building as an individual structure, as part of a series of buildings, and as a part of a neighborhood should be respected. Take care to insure that your design blends well with surrounding buildings, sidewalks and other public improvements. A visually unified downtown is a powerful tool for attracting people to our downtown and to the individual shops and businesses located there.
Step back and look at your property from across the street from the corner from nearby intersections. What does the community see? Some things, like air conditioning units and satellite dishes, are more noticeable from a distance.
398

Traditional Façade
The storefront is a distinct entity that demands a complete design statement, not just the remodeling of a doorway or the addition of a new wall surface. Changes have occurred to our buildings during the years in response to various merchandising trends and changing tenants. In most cases, the changes affected the storefront area while leaving the upper façade intact. In some cases, the original storefronts may still be in place but covered over or in need of maintenance or repair.
The traditional commercial storefront can be the most important element that gives historical significance and character to the downtown. The traditional commercial façade consists of three parts:
? the storefront with an entrance
and large display windows;
? the upper masonry façade with
regularly spaced windows;
and
? the decorative cornice that
caps the building.
These components may appear in various shapes, sizes and styles, but the result is essentially consistent with the traditional façade.
1st Floor Storefront Design
The traditional downtown building façade has a well-defined opening that was filled by the original storefront. The opening is bounded on each side by piers, which were usually constructed of masonry. It is bounded on top by the band course or the storefront cornice (the structural element supporting the upper façade) and bounded below by the sidewalk.
The storefront was composed almost entirely of windows. The large glass opening served to display goods the store or business had to sell. It also allowed natural light deep into the store, thus minimizing the need for an artificial light source. 399
8
The visual transparency of the storefront is also important because it is part of the overall proportion system of the façade. The proportion of window - to - wall areas in the traditional façade calls for more glass and less wall at the storefront level, balanced by more wall and less glass on the upper façade. It is important that these proportions be
maintained so that Downtown Myrtle Beach will be unified by consistent design, thus making it an attractive place for customers to do business.
Improvements
In considering improvements to the storefront, it is very important that the original opening be recognized and maintained. The remodeled storefront should be designed to fit inside the original opening and not extend beyond or in front of it.
Key Points to Consider:
? The storefront should be composed primarily of glass. If transparency is not appropriate, consider the use of window treatments, such as blinds or drapes.
? Effort should be made to create an inviting entry. The entry should be maintained and restored in its original location and configuration. If the original entry is gone, the new entry should be designed and placed with consideration to traditional design themes and their relationship to the overall building façade and symmetry. Where appropriate, recessed entries are encouraged.
? Transom windows that are covered or blocked should be reopened and restored.
? Storefront bulkheads should be restored or renovated.
? Original elements, such as keystones, cornices, entry doors, and lighting fixtures should be restored.
? Signs should be integrated into the storefront design.
? Lighting should be integrated into the storefront design.
? Awnings, if appropriate, should be integrated into the storefront design.
The storefront design should be true to the time period in which the building was constructed. For example, renovating early 20th century buildings with colonial motifs and mansard roofs would be inappropriate. When planning the storefront renovation, it could be very helpful to contact the Horry County Historic Society for information regarding your building. Old photographs can be valuable tools in determining original design, materials and signs used on your building.
Storefront Materials
Build storefronts out of the best materials; after all, their appearance will denote the quality of products and services the customer can expect to find inside. When designing a new storefront or renovating an existing one, remember the goal should be a transparent façade. Keeping the materials simple and unobtrusive will help you achieve this goal. There is no need to introduce additional types of building materials to those that originally existed. Whether building new or renovating existing storefronts, use materials that perform their intended function well, and use them consistently throughout the design. Utilizing this approach will enable you to achieve simplicity in the design and uniformity in the overall storefront appearance.
400
9
Utilize existing materials whenever possible, repairing rather than replacing. Typical examples of materials and their location on the storefront include:
? Storefront Frame: wood, cast iron, anodized aluminum, steel.
? Display Windows: clear glass.
? Transom Windows: clear, tinted, stained or etched glass.
? Entrance: wood, cast iron or aluminum with a large glass panel.
? Bulkheads: recessed wood paneling, polished stone, glass, tile, metal-clad plywood panels, granite, marble, sandstone, pressed metal.
? Storefront Cornice: wood, cast iron, pressed metal.
? Side Piers: should be the same material as the upper façade, typically brick or stone.
When applied thoughtfully and tastefully, ornately cast metal columns and trim of intricately molded terra cotta, wood or ironwork all contribute to appealing, dignified storefronts.
Certain materials should never be used on the traditional commercial building. Such inappropriate materials may include imitation brick, rough textured wood siding, wooden shingles on mansard roofs, gravel aggregate and vinyl siding. These materials have no relationship to the original design themes and, therefore violate the consistency of the buildings appearance and the downtown area.
What to Do?
Depending on the buildings condition and the amount of money you have budgeted, there are three basic approaches you may want to consider:
? Minimal Rehabilitation: This preservation approach to rehabilitation requires basic maintenance, necessary replacement, removal of extraneous materials and simple design improvements. Cosmetic treatments like covering a timeworn storefront with an awning or painting a contemporary storefront a dark receding color to minimize its effect, can help to unify the building.
? Major Renovation: This approach retains the façades existing original elements while using contemporary and traditional design and materials for replacement of inappropriate elements. Technology has led to many advancements in construction materials in the years since our downtown was originally built. Longer lasting synthetic materials are available to replace the more traditional materials of days gone by. When selecting your renovation materials, whether technologically advanced or traditionally sound, choose only those materials high in visual and structural quality. In all major renovations, care must be taken to insure that the design of improvements is understated so as not to compete with the overall character of the façade. For instance, when installing a new storefront, any of these alternatives would be appropriate:
? A contemporary design in wood or anodized aluminum.
? A simplified version of a traditional storefront in wood or aluminum.
? A traditional period storefront constructed in wood.
401
10
? Restoration: This approach restores the façade to its original condition. It involves the exact duplication of the original storefront, including its architectural detail, color scheme and design placement. If a building has undergone only minor alterations, restoration may be relatively inexpensive and would be most desirable.
Doors
The entry to a storefront often can be the focus of a buildings façade. Maintaining a traditional entry door or pair of doors can contribute to the overall character of the façade. Traditionally, the entrance door was made of wood with a large glass panel. Every effort should be made to maintain and repair an original door.
Although recessed entries are encouraged, take care to make the recessed space feel safe, both day and night. Bright lights and ornamental gates can be effective in this regard.
If a door is to be replaced, consideration should be given to one of the following options:
? Have a new door built with the same design and proportions as the original.
? Find a manufactured wood or steel door that resembles the traditional storefront door.
? Use a standard aluminum, commercial door with wide stiles and a dark anodized or baked enamel finish.
The transparency of the storefront should be carried through the design of the door. Avoid doors that are residential in character or decorated with moldings, crossbucks, or window grills.
402
11
Signs
Signs are a vital part of any downtown area, providing businesses with identity and providing customers with direction. Signs also contribute to the overall image of Downtown Myrtle Beach. Because they are such a visible storefront element, signs must be designed, selected and utilized appropriately so as not to detract from the façade or from surrounding buildings. With a little forethought and careful planning, signs can fulfill the business owners needs and enhance the image of Downtown Myrtle Beach.
Placement and Number
Each storefront should be limited to two signs: one primary and one secondary. The primary sign should be located on the building façade above storefront display windows, but below the sills of second floor windows. Turn-of-the-century buildings often used a continuous brick ledge, or corbelling, to separate the storefront from the upper stories. This space is ideal for sign placement, as it often was created for this purpose.
The secondary sign can be a small hanging sign that identifies the business for the pedestrian, or a sign painted on a door or display window. This sign is generally oriented toward pedestrians. A sign in a window should not obscure the display area and shall not occupy more than 25 percent of any vision window.
The goal is to create a pedestrian oriented downtown, where shoppers feel comfortable strolling along the sidewalks and traffic flows at a neighborhood pace. Therefore, it doesnt make a lot of sense to place your signs too high for the pedestrian to easily see. By placing the signs at a more human level, communication effectiveness will be improved. As an added bonus the signs will also be beneath the canopy of shade trees.
403
12
Size
Big does not necessarily mean powerful. Signs should be visually integrated with the storefront to produce a consistent and unified statement about the business within. A sign that overpowers the storefront does not communicate a positive image to the customer. Signs should always be in scale with their surroundings. Actual size may vary, but in general, a wall mounted sign or signboard should be no more than 2-1/2 feet high or span more than 1/2 of the building width. Lettering should be 8 to 18 inches high and occupy between 50 and 65 percent of the signboard.
Lettering and Graphics
There are hundreds of lettering types available from sign contractors and designers. The building owner should select a style that expresses the business message and is compatible with the building and Downtown Myrtle Beach. Decorative, serif and sans serif styles can all be used in the downtown area, but should be selected for compatibility with the type of business and type of building.
In most cases, signs should be limited to a maximum of three colors, two materials and one lettering style. Use available information about the colors, materials, lettering style and placement of the original signs on the building when designing new ones. Sign colors should compliment the building colors.
Wooden signs with raised letters, metal signs, painted signs and gold leaf are all appropriate downtown, though not for every building.
Nationally distributed or mass produced signs should be avoided; they typically do not express the character of Downtown Myrtle Beach or its unique businesses.
Content
Signs should express an easy-to-read, direct message. Keep it simple! Wording should be minimal, limited to the name of the business and, if necessary, a word or two that expresses its character. Simple wording is easily read by pedestrians and motorists without creating distraction and clutter.
A sign that presents more than 10 items of information is lost on its observer. Count one item of information for each
? Syllable
? Symbol, graphic or logo
? Abbreviation
? Broken plane, such as two lines rather than one
? Discontinuous odd shape.
404
13
Signs should be used primarily for identifying the business, not for subjecting viewers to myriad advertisements.
Lighting
Illuminated signs may be appropriate downtown if they respect the proportions of the storefront and the other sign design guidelines. Use lighting that provides a true color rendition. The light source should be designed as part of the sign or hidden from view. Exterior lighting is preferred, but be cautious of exposed lights that produce glare and are unpleasant for customers and neighbors. Unattractive electrical fixtures, conduits and wires should be concealed. Exposed neon letters can be effective, adding color and vitality to the street, only if it is appropriate to the architecture of the building. Plastic, backlit signs should be avoided.
Tree / Sign Conflicts
Signs are the lifeblood of most businesses. But so is a friendly, inviting shopping environment. Trees can provide a softened touch to an otherwise harsh downtown area and reduce even the most imposing buildings to human scale. And they can do so without interfering with signs.
Trees can be an important way to provide an interesting, attractive business environment. They do this by giving the area a unified appearance in a place where stores may vary widely in architectural design. They also soften hard building materials, sidewalks and streets, and add color, character and seasonal variety. And, of course, they provide cool shade during our hot summers.
When choosing the design and location of your signs, be sure to consider their relation to the sidewalk trees. Make sure your signs are readable between the trees and below their canopy. And remember, trees grow, so plan for the future.
Design and Construction Services
Choose a professional sign maker carefully. Quality of workmanship and construction is as vital as quality of design. Ask your neighbors for references, and ask the contractor where you can see examples of previous work.
City Ordinance Requirements
In addition to these design guidelines, the City of Myrtle Beach has ordinances that control the size, height and placement of signs. Before investing money in a sign, determine whether it will comply with the applicable requirements and restrictions. A permit, including approval of the Community Appearance Board, is required prior to installation of most types of signs. Please contact the Myrtle Beach Construction Services Department for sign and awning regulations specific to your zoning district.

Awnings & Canopies
The canvas awning was an important design element in the traditional storefront. It provides shelter, added color and serves as a transition between the storefront and the upper façade. An awning should reinforce the frame of the storefront window, but should not cover the piers on either side. It should be attached below the sign panel (the space between the second story window sills and the first story façade.) In some cases, the awning may be mounted between the transom and the display windows, thus allowing light to enter through the transom while shading pedestrians and merchandise. An awning should not be backlit.
Where possible, retain and repair awning fixtures and canopies that originate from the buildings earlier historical periods. When necessary, new awnings should be complementary in placement, proportion and color to the buildings original fixtures and to existing awnings and canopies of adjacent buildings. New awnings should be constructed of cloth material. Vinyl, plastic and metal are inappropriate to traditional façades and generally detract from the historic character of the area. Consideration should be given to replacing inappropriate awnings and canopies with traditional canvas fixtures.
Awnings should be regularly maintained. Rips or tears must be repaired so that the repair is not noticeable from the sidewalk or road. If a tear cannot be inconspicuously repaired, or if the original awning color changes significantly, the awning must be replaced.
A standard street level awning should be mounted so that the lowest point, including any valance, is a minimum of nine (9) feet above grade and projects no further than eight (8) feet into the right-of-way and no closer than twelve (12) inches from the curb.
Remember that our area is prone to high winds (100 miles per hour is not unusual). Awning materials should be chosen carefully and should be strong enough to withstand extreme weather conditions. Metal frames are recommended.
Inappropriate storefront alterations can be effectively disguised by mounting an awning over the alterations while maintaining the proportions of the original storefront.

Sidewalks
Downtown Myrtle Beach has in place a Sidewalk Café / Decor ordinance that allows tables, chairs and plants to be placed on the sidewalk in front of some downtown storefronts. When tastefully designed and cared for, the following elements can add to the friendly, pedestrian image of Downtown Myrtle Beach:
? Tables and chairs where restaurant patrons
can enjoy our beautiful weather with their
meal.
? Colorful window boxes hanging from
storefront windows.
? Terra cotta pots with small tree and flower
arrangements.
? Old fashioned Southern rocking chairs where
shoppers can sit and relax.
? Park benches where friends can stop for a
chat.
A Sidewalk Café / Décor Permit is required for all items placed in the right-of-way, so be sure to apply at the Myrtle Beach Construction Services Department before investing any money.
Upper Stories
While storefront design conveys the image of the business occupying the building, upper story design conveys the image of the town. Design elements of upper stories are often ignored, leaving the top floors plain and bland. Dimension should be added to otherwise flat, hard surfaces through the use of some simple design techniques:
? Place window hoods over the upper level windows.
? Place individual awnings over the windows. This is particularly effective with arched awnings over arched windows.
? Carry the side pier design from the storefront on upward to the roof. This will frame your upper façade the same way it does the lower.
? Place a decorative cornice or parapet along the top edge of the building. After all your hard work below, your façade should not come to an end with a blank wall meeting a flat roof.
407
16
Windows
Windows are an important component of the façade; they open the building with light and offer a proportional continuity between the upper floors and the storefront. Deteriorated windows have often been covered over, inappropriately replaced or simply neglected, thereby diminishing the overall character of the building. Every effort should be made to retain and preserve each original window, its function and any decorative details still remaining.
Remove any covering that has been installed over the original windows. Protect and maintain the wood and metal of the windows and their surroundings with appropriate surface treatments, such as cleaning or rust removal. All bare wood should be primed with a high quality, oil-based primer and painted with one or two coats of latex or oil-based paint. A qualified glazier can fix loose or broken windowpanes easily. Make windows weather tight by re-caulking and replacing or installing weather stripping.
Check the overall condition of window materials and window features to determine if repairs are required. Check all wood parts of the window for decay, cracks or splitting. Pay particular attention to the sills and window sash bottoms where water may collect. Repair window frames and sashes by patching, splicing or reinforcing. Replace all parts that are deteriorating or missing. Cracks should be filled with caulk, wood putty or epoxy reinforcement and the surface sanded. Do not replace the entire window when limited replacement of parts is appropriate.
408
17
If an original window is missing or deteriorating beyond repair, replace the window with one that matches the original. Use the overall form and any detailing still evident as a guide. Use the same type of material as the original or a compatible substitute. Always fill the entire original window opening, even if part of the original opening had been previously filled in.
All window air conditioning units that are visible from the street or sidewalk should be removed. Air conditioners that drip on the public sidewalk are greatly discouraged.
Rear Façade
Areas behind buildings often are forgotten or neglected. Customers tend to avoid rear entrances because these areas can be unkempt and unattractive. The rears of most buildings are commonly thought of as service areas where deliveries are made or the garbage is picked up. However, a large percentage of existing and developing parking lots are located adjacent to or abutting these entrance. Available parking in Downtown Myrtle Beach, particularly for Superblock businesses, is so often located behind buildings that rear or side entrances are warranted. The rears of the buildings are coming into full and open view.
A combination of front entrances with side or rear entrances is called double frontage. There are certain advantages to double fronting, including:
? Enhanced circulation patterns.
? Better access to off-street parking.
? Store identity created on more than one side of the building.
If you dont have an attractive, customer friendly rear entrance, but are considering improvements, ask yourself these questions:
? Where do my customers typically park?
? Would a rear entrance be an added convenience for my customers?
? What changes would I have to make to my store for an attractive rear entry?
? How would added walk-through traffic help my business?
Like the storefront, the rear entry should respect its neighbors. An attempt to make your entrance compatible with surrounding businesses should be a priority. Look at the back entrances next to yours before you make any changes. Work with your neighbors to create unity in this all-too-often ignored area.
409
18
The rear entry should not compete with the storefront in importance, but like the front, the back entry requires identification. A rear door window panel is one way to identify and open your store to customers. A small sign on or near the door is another identifier. Be sure to keep it small and do not clutter the area with too many signs. An awning is a pleasant addition and a convenience to shoppers during inclement weather.
Normal service activities, such as trash collection and loading, also must occur with ease. It is possible to accommodate these functions and make the rear spaces enjoyable people places at the same time. Pick a central location for trash collection that will serve several stores efficiently. Simple enclosures can be constructed to hide trash receptacles and to prevent clutter. Before construction, be sure you consult the trash collection agency to ensure that your design will not disrupt pick-up services.
Plantings either can add or detract from a rear building area. If there is enough sun, planter boxes should be utilized as an attractive buffering element. Remember that plants require care, so commit to caring for them properly. Weeds are a detracting and visually negative element in unattended areas. Planting ground cover in exposed soil areas can help choke out weeds. For a positive image, keep all plantings under control and consistently well maintained.
With good design and proper maintenance, rear entrances can become attractive and convenient for shoppers and highly beneficial to Downtown Myrtle Beach.
Colors & Paint
The placement of colors - rather than the number of colors - best accentuates the architectural details. Colors are distributed into three categories: base, trim (major and minor) and accent. The base often matches the natural color of building materials, such as brick or stone. The major trim color is used to frame the façade, doors and windows. The major trim color is also the primary color of the cornice and major architectural elements. If a minor trim color is used, it is often a darker shade placed on doors and window sashes. An accent color is used in limited doses to highlight small details. Colors should tie the architectural elements together. The color scheme should be consistent throughout the façades upper and lower portions. The colors chosen should be harmonious, not only with the colors on your building, but also with the colors on neighboring buildings.
410
19
Historical Color Scheme
This color scheme uses body, trim and accent colors from a particular time period. Historical color schemes are appropriate for the style and character of landmark buildings or buildings located in historic areas. The colors should compliment the color schemes on adjacent buildings. Colors may be chosen based on paint chip analysis of a buildings original color or based on colors used on other buildings of the period. Color guides of documented historical hues from selected paint manufacturers are an aid in historical color selection. Old photos of the building or a similar one can establish light verses dark color placement.
Boutique Color Scheme
This non-historical color scheme uses bright trim and accent colors in dramatic contrast to the base color of a building. A building must have an extremely ornate architecture to pick out details successfully with multiple accent colors, so use this color scheme cautiously. Too many colors on the wrong elements will detract from the buildings character and that of its neighbors. Taken to an extreme, boutique color schemes can create a building that looks as though a carnival is taking place inside.
Playful, exaggerated color schemes and architectural themes can work well in an urban downtown, only if carried through an area as large as one block or more. A wild, Art Deco design may look great in an entire district, but would look silly on a single building sandwiched between two Mediterranean façades.
Surface Preparation
Proper surface preparation of wood, metal and masonry prior to repainting will maximize the longevity of the topcoat. The following steps will help prevent premature paint failure:
? Thoroughly remove dirt, mildew and paint chalk with a mild detergent.
? Remove failing paint on wood with electric heat, scraping or sanding.
? Remove failing paint on metal or masonry with an approved chemical application
Never sandblast! Sandblasting, high pressure washes or other abrasive paint removal methods should never be undertaken. Well-documented evidence shows that these
Bad Design -> 411
20
methods do irreversible damage to wood and masonry surfaces. Sandblasting removes the hard glazed surface from kiln fired masonry and exposes thinner, more porous material to water infiltration and accelerates deterioration. Sandblasting also severely pits the surfaces of masonry and wood, and opens wood grain to moisture, dirt and mildew infiltration.
Significant architectural elements should be retained, repaired or preserved whenever possible. As a last resort, damaged material should be replaced with similar, matching material only. Weathered and cracked wood should be treated with consolidates, preservatives and / or filters, then sanded prior to sealing.
Painting
The purpose of paint is to seal the building surface against the elements and to prevent deterioration of materials from temperature and humidity extremes. Generally, wall surfaces that have not been painted, such as brick, terra cotta, stone and cast concrete should remain unpainted. Soft, porous brick that was originally painted should remain painted. Always select paint that is formulated for the particular surface application planned. A primer coat seals the surface and enhances the bond with the comparable topcoats. On unsealed wood and metal surfaces, use oil or alkyd primers. Unsealed masonry requires a specialized primer / sealer. When repainting over an existing topcoat, continue to use the same paint formulation - oil or latex. If a formula change is necessary, or if the original paint type cannot be determined, then prime with a first coat specifically made for the topcoat planned. Finally, apply two topcoats to provide the most durable finish.
Masonry
Many buildings in Downtown Myrtle Beach consist of brick masonry. Some structures also consist of stone, concrete block and marble. Masonry is a strong, durable building material and, when well maintained, can last for centuries. Masonry cleaning and repointing are two very common methods of masonry repair. While both may improve the appearance of a building, care must be taken to determine the proper techniques used so that no harm is done to the masonry.
Masonry Cleaning
First of all, it should not be assumed that all masonry needs cleaning. Surface stains generally cause few problems and can even enhance the charm of an older building. However, evidence may indicate that heavy dirt and other pollutants are actually harming the masonry. It is reasonable to clean masonry where it is necessary to halt deterioration or to remove unsightly and heavy soiling, but take care not to destroy the natural characteristics that come with age.
412
21
Some questions to consider:
? How clean does the surface need to be?
? What is the nature of the soil and how tightly is it adhering to the surface?
? What is the masonry type and what are its characteristics?
? How is the surface constructed? Are there any metal attachments that could rust?
? How can the environment, as well as peoples health, best be protected during the cleaning?
Select the gentlest cleaning method possible to achieve an acceptable level of cleanliness. Work with a professional to help ensure that the method chosen is right for your building.
2 Acceptable Cleaning Methods:
? Water: This method ranges from hand scrubbing to pressure washing to steam cleaning. It softens and rinses dirt deposits from the surface. Water cleaning generally is the simplest, gentlest, safest and least expensive method of masonry cleaning.
? Chemical: Chemical cleaners include acidic, alkaline or organic compounds in either liquid or vapor forms. The chemical reacts with the dirt and / or the masonry to hasten the dirt removal process. Be careful! When used improperly, chemical run-off can cause serious damage to the environment, including plants, animals and waterways.
Generally, it is better to clean the masonry with the gentlest method possible. Check with the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) before using any chemical cleansers. To select the best cleaning technique perform a patch test. Observe the results for a sufficient time period (all four seasons, if possible) to determine the immediate and long-range effects of the cleaning method. Abrasives, including grit blasting, grinders or sanding disks, can cause great damage to masonry surfaces, and are inappropriate ways to clean old masonry.
Repointing
Repointing is the removal of deteriorating or failing mortar from masonry joints and replacing it with new mortar. Repointing can restore the visual and physical integrity of the masonry. Generally, it is better to clean the masonry before resorting to repointing, unless the mortar is badly eroded. Some obvious signs of deterioration may include:
? Disintegration of mortar.
? Cracks in mortar joints.
? Loose bricks, cornice sections or decorative elements.
413
22
As a general rule, only repoint where there is deterioration. Repointing should only be done by an experienced professional.
If you decide to repoint, consider the following:
? Duplicate the original mortar in strength, composition, color and texture.
? Rake the joint carefully to an even face and uniform depth, preferably with the use of hand tools.
? Duplicate old mortar joints in width and profile.
Professional Assistance
Wow, there sure is a lot to think about! And each design element, be it the entry door or a second story window, is as important as the others. The renovations you make are not just improvements to your building  they are also improvements to your business and to your neighborhood. Creating a thorough design plan can seem overwhelming, especially if youve never done one before. Remember, this is an investment in your future and in your community. Never under estimate the value of hiring a design professional.
414
23
New Construction
The construction of new buildings on vacant lots is encouraged. The design of a new downtown building is a special challenge. Its front façade should be designed to be compatible with the surrounding buildings.
The appearance of a new building must always be sensitive to the character of its neighbors, without mimicking them. There are several factors that will govern the visual relationship between a new building and its neighbors:
Building Placement
Buildings in Downtown Myrtle Beach should be constructed parallel to streets and in close relationship to the street frontage. The new façade should be flush to its neighbors façades, unless a restaurant use is planned. In the case of restaurant construction, it is encouraged that the façade be set back so as to provide an outdoor eating area that extends to the front lot line.
415
24
Mixed-use retail and office buildings should abut the sidewalks on at least one side and orient the primary entrance, or entrances, toward the street.
Pedestrian access to and on the site is a primary issue. Harmonious design and functionality should be provided relative to uses on the site and on adjacent rights-of-way and private properties. Aspects of design to be considered include:
? Handicapped Access
? Pavement Material
? Landscaping
? Lighting
? Seating
Dimensions
When Downtown Myrtle Beach was first constructed, Main Street and Kings Highway were dirt roads! Back then, the roads were narrower and the surrounding building heights provided a comfortable, human scale. Over the years, these roads have been widened while the building heights remained the same. As a result, the current downtown views have a hard feeling more appropriate for a highway than a downtown. For this reason, new buildings taller than one story are encouraged.
However, very tall building façades can create a canyon effect on the sidewalk below. To avoid this, the vertical plane of a façade should not exceed 36 feet in height. Above that, the upper stories should be set back a minimum of five feet from the lower façade. The first three floors should be distinguished from the remainder of the building with an emphasis on design elements that will enhance the pedestrian environment. Elements that add special interest include:
? Cornices
? Belt Courses
? Corbelling
? Molding
? Stringcourses
? Ornamentation
? Changes in Material or Color
416
25
Special attention should be given to the design of windows on the first three floors. Recessed windows that are distinguished from the shaft of the building are encouraged. This can be achieved through the use of:
? Arches
? Pediments
? Mullions
The width of the surrounding buildings determines the general width for a new structure. The new building should occupy the entire space and reflect the characteristic rhythm of façades along the street. If the site is large, the mass of the façade should be broken into a number of small bays to maintain a rhythm with the surrounding buildings. The original downtown lot widths provide a natural guide for the width of each bay. See sketch below.
Special Provisions for Buildings in Focal Point Locations
Focal points include corner locations and lots located at the termination of a street or where a street changes direction. Particular care should be given to the design of all façades of buildings in these prominent locations. Garage doors, service entrances, and un-ornamented walls should not be placed in highly visible locations. In general, buildings at focal point locations should also be taller than surrounding structures, and focal point locations at the center of a continuous façade should be taller than adjacent portions of the rest of the building. When planned with good design and taste, corner buildings that are taller and have larger features can break up the monotony of a long, straight sidewalk and give the streetscape a more human scale.
417
26
Composition
The composition of the new façade - that is, the organization of its parts - should be similar to that of surrounding façades. Rhythms that carry through the block, such as window spacing, should be incorporated into the new façade.
Proportions of the Openings
The size and proportion of window or door openings of a new building should be similar to those on surrounding façades. The same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the façade as a whole. Rhythms that carry throughout the block (such as window spacing) should be incorporated into the new façade.
Doorways should be recessed into the face of the building to provide a sense of entry and to add variety to the streetscape. The entryway should be 1 square foot for each 1,000 square feet of floor area, with a minimum of 15 square feet.
Pedestrian movement is very important to the success of Downtown Myrtle Beach. Although people love to window shop on a beautiful day, most are unwilling to walk long distances between stores. In fact, various studies have shown that shoppers will stop in their tracks and turn around if they cannot easily see the next storefront. For that reason, long, blank walls are greatly discouraged in Downtown Myrtle Beach. Where expanses of solid wall are necessary, they should not exceed 20 feet in length. The use of transparent windows and doors at the street level helps create interest. Detailing of street walls with awnings and a variation of building materials adds to this interest. Multiple entrances from the public sidewalk or open spaces are encouraged.
418
27
Structured parking facilities should be designed so that the only garage openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access. The remainder of the street level frontage should be occupied retail or office space. If neither of those options is conducive to your location, then an architecturally articulated façade should be designed to screen the parking area of the structure and to encourage pedestrian activity.
Detailing
New architecture should reflect the elements and detailing of surrounding buildings. Emphasize the quality of detail and special form in:
? Window Shapes
? Cornice Lines
? Brick Work
? Window Treatments
? Columns
? Eaves
In the upper stories of structures over four stories, a variety of shapes, angles and reliefs are encouraged.
Materials
A new façade should be composed of materials similar to those in adjacent façades. The new building should not stand in opposition to the others. Buildings should be constructed of materials that minimize light reflection and glare. Appropriate materials include:
? Brick
? Stucco
? Smooth Finished Concrete
? Architectural Metals
419
28
Color
The colors chosen for a new façade should relate to those on neighboring buildings. Care should be taken to avoid clashing colors on individual buildings and between adjacent buildings.
Roof Forms
The type of roof used should be similar to those found on adjacent buildings. The roofline of buildings should be modulated to avoid large areas of flat roof, and should include interesting architectural features. Preferably, the upper cornice will cover the visibility of a flat roof from the front façade.
Consideration should be given to the appearance from taller buildings nearby. Rooftop mechanical equipment and satellite dish antennas should be screened in a manner that enhances the overall architectural design. Rooftops should be of a color that reduces glare. Rooftop terraces and gardens are encouraged  what a wonderful amenity to a residential apartment or downtown restaurant! Refer to sketch on page 23.
Paving
A paving element in the public space can be repeated in the private space in order to give continuity and transition. However, the paving systems used in private plazas and walkways may be different in color, material and texture from those in the public right-of-way. A contrasting pattern with more detail (such as brick, granite or similar material) offers a unifying element for the plaza or walkway. The contrasting pattern establishes the private boundaries and gives the space an overall pedestrian scale.
Bad Design -> 420
29
The transition between public and private spaces offers a tremendous opportunity to establish a sense of arrival, establish a particular developments unique character and add an overall liveliness and variety to the pedestrian environment.
Vehicular Areas
Vehicular access to and on sites should be designated to minimize interference with pedestrian access and with traffic flow on abutting streets. Drive-up windows are discouraged. The number of access points should be kept to the minimum necessary to prevent undue congestion.
Vehicular use areas should be designed to maximize pedestrian circulation and handicapped accessibility. These areas should be located so as not to detract from the streetscape created by buildings, open spaces and landscaping. Take care to provide safe lighting that blends with the design of the site and adjacent sites. Landscape vehicular areas so as to reduce heat, accentuate pedestrian routes, and buffer the view of vehicles from adjacent street rights-of-way and private properties.
Shop
Cafe 421
30
Locate surface parking lots behind the building and away from areas of high public visibility. Parking areas should be designed to minimize long, straight, monotonous rows. The size and location of parking areas should be minimized and related to the group of buildings served. Parking areas should include a clear circulation network to guide pedestrians to the building entrances.
Loading areas should be designed so as not to interfere with pedestrian circulation or vehicular circulation on abutting streets.
Consideration should be given to providing facilities for bicyclists, especially parking, so as to encourage the use of bicycles.
Landscaping
Open space and landscaping should be designed to complement the buildings on the site and the streetscape in general. Aspects of landscape design include:
? Location
? Size
? Shape
? Amenities
? Material
? Plant Species
? Intended Use of any Open Space
? Intended Function of the Landscaping
When choosing the type and location of your trees, be sure to consider their relation to all signs. Make sure your signs, your neighbors signs, and all public signs are readable between the trees and below their canopy. And remember, trees grow, so plan for the future. Appropriate trees should be selected from the Myrtle Beach Community Tree Planting Plan (see Appendix E).
Screening
All structures and facilities for trash, storage, loading, and outdoor equipment should be screened so as not to be visible from the street and pedestrian areas. The most desirable solution is to locate those uses on areas of the site that are not visible from public rights-of-way. A grade separation, when applicable to the site, designed in combination with landscaping, can also be used.
Trash Receptacle
422
31
Grade level parking lots should be screened by shrubs and trees in accordance with the Myrtle Beach Landscape Ordinance. It is necessary to accommodate the vehicle overhang when designing landscaped areas in parking lots. Plants are often damaged if a landscape strip is not wide enough to provide for both the plants and the vehicle overhang.

C. The Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation
When rehabilitating a historic structure, the following Standards are recommended to be applied in a reasonable manner, while taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alterations of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
4. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired, rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design.
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
8. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
9. New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

Cc: Fox Simons; Allison Hardin; Diane Moskow-McKenzie Subject: RE: Cell Towers
Agree whole heartedly. Any questions regarding cell towers I automatically refer directly to Section 1311.
From: Tom Ellenburg Sent: Tuesday, July 21, 2015 9:44 AM To: Kelly Mezzapelle; Kenneth May Cc: Fox Simons; Allison Hardin; Diane Moskow-McKenzie Subject: RE: Cell Towers
Under the circumstances of timing that are involved, I believe that you may delete Cell Tower form the permitted use table in 1407.C, leaving them regulated by 1311.
Do you disagree, Mr. Zoning Administrator?
From: Kelly Mezzapelle Sent: Wednesday, July 15, 2015 2:54 PM To: Tom Ellenburg Cc: Fox Simons; Allison Hardin; Diane Moskow-McKenzie Subject: Cell Towers
Hi Tom,
Several months ago we passed regulations pertaining to cell towers, where they could be installed and under what circumstances (section 1311). What we didnt do was amend the Permitted Use table (section 1407.C), which lists Cell Towers as only allowed by Special Exception and only in the MU-M, MU-H, A, CG, E, HC (now HC1), MP, AP, BP, LM, and WM zones. In Ordinance 2015-42 passed last month we added it as an outright permitted use in the new HC2.
Since 1407.C preceded 1311, and since the sections contradict each other, may I simply delete the Cell Tower line from the permitted use table in 1407.C, leaving them regulated only by 1311, or will that require an act of Council?

ORDINANCE 2019-28 05/14/19
AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND APPENDIX A, OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE TO ALLOW
INDOOR URBAN MICRO FARMS AS A PERMITTED USE IN THE LM (LIGHT
MANUFACTURING), WM (WHOLESALE MANUFACTURING) DISTRICTS, AND AS A
CONDITIONAL USE IN THE MU-M (MIXED USE MEDIUM DENSITY) DISTRICT.
440
Note: Section added in the ordinance is numbered 1501.RR, which was already added in 2018-68. 2019-28 is therefore codified in section 1501.SS.
ORDINANCE 2019-31 07/09/19
ORDINANCE TO AMEND APPENDIX A ZONING OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
TO CREATE THE GRAND STRAND MEDICAL CENTER SPECIAL SIGN DISTRICT
Note: the boundary exhibit was not attached to the signed ordinance. I pulled it from the staff report.
Corrected Section 810 regarding A-Frame Signs per Ordinance 2012-29 and email correspondence in December 2018.
Corrected Section 1714.B to jibe an inconsistency with the definition of Visitor Accommodations in Section 203.
Combined the Tavern and Bar rows in the table in 1407.C to eliminate redundancy.
ORDINANCE 2019-35 08/13/19
AN ORDINANCE TO REZONE -2.16 ACRES BETWEEN OCEAN BLVD AND CHESTER ST
(PIN#42415040199, 42415040200, 42415040201, 44402010431) AND THE ADJACENT RIGHTS-OFWAY OF OCEAN BLVD AND WITHERS DR FROM MU-H (MIXED-USE HIGH DENSITY) TO A (AMUSEMENT) IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE A MIX OF FAMILY-CENTRIC USES AND TO AMEND SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF APPENDIX A ZONING TO
RESTRICT AMUSEMENTS NEAR A PUBLIC LIBRARY, SCHOOL OR CHURCH.
Corrected omission of maximum densities for the C6 and E districts during the zoning rewrite. Prior code listed no maximum density for C-6. The E district is based on the old OZ-50, which was laid over R-15. C6 and E have been added to the density table in 1603.D. accordingly.
ORDINANCE 2019-47 09/24/19

Formatted error corrected: 805.P was designated in 2019-31, so ART district signage is in 805.Q.
