986, 5/5/2014]
1. Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with Act 3 of
2008, the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, as amended; to provide
access to public records of Ferguson Township, to preserve the
integrity of Ferguson Township's records, and to minimize the financial
impact to the residents regarding the resources utilized in the receipt
and processing of public record requests and the retrieval and copying
of public records.
2. Public Records.
A. A "public record" is defined as any record, including financial
records, of a commonwealth or local agency that is not exempt
under § 708 of Act 3 of 2008, is not exempt from being disclosed
under any other federal or state law or regulation or judicial order
or decree, or is not protected by a privilege.
B. Records are information, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, that document a transaction or activity of an
agency and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or
in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the agency.
The term includes a document, paper, letter, map, book, tape,
photograph, film or sound recording, information stored or
maintained electronically and a data-processed or image-processed
document.
§ 1-204 FERGUSON CODE § 1-206
FWD:48
3. Inspection. Public records are open to inspection and for duplication
during normal office hours, except for holidays, subject to the
regulations set forth herein.
4. Open Records Officer.
A. The Township Manager and Chief of Police are designated as Rightto-
Know Officers. The Township Manager shall fulfill the
responsibilities of Right-to-Know Officer for all departments except
for the Police Department which shall be fulfilled by the Chief of
Police. The designated "Right-To-Know Officer" shall designate
certain employee(s) to process public record requests. The
Ferguson Township Manager is responsible for minimizing, where
possible, the financial impact to Ferguson Township regarding the
resources utilized in the receipt and processing of public record
requests and the retrieval and copying of public records.
B. Upon receipt of a written open records request, the Ferguson
Township Manager, Chief of Police or his/her designee shall:
(1) Note the date of receipt on the written request.
(2) Compute the day on which the five-day period will expire and
make a notation of that date on the written request.
(3) Maintain an electronic or paper copy of a written request,
including all documents submitted with the request, until the
request has been fulfilled. If the request is denied, the written
request shall be maintained for 30 days or, if an appeal is filed,
until a final determination is issued or the appeal is deemed
denied.
5. Open Records Request. A written request for access to records may be
submitted in person, by mail, by e-mail, by facsimile or provided by way
of the Township's or the commonwealth's Right-To-Know Request Form.
A written request must be addressed to either the Ferguson Township
Manager, Chief of Police or the Ferguson Township Right-To-Know
Officer. All employees who receive a request shall immediately forward
requests for records to the Township Manager, Chief of Police or
designee. Regardless of the form received, no employee other than the
Right-To-Know Officer or his/her designee shall determine if the request
is in its proper form. A written request should identify or describe the
records sought with sufficient specificity to enable the Township to
ascertain which records are being requested and should include the
name and address to which the Township should address its response.
An anonymous request places the onus on the requestor to return to the
Township office in a timely manner to pick up the response. A written
request need not include any explanation of the requestor's reason for
requesting, or intended use of, the records, unless otherwise required
by law.
§ 1-206 FOREWORD § 1-206
FWD:49
6. Redaction. While Ferguson Township will disclose public records
subject to access, Ferguson Township is not required to synthesize,
compile, maintain, format, or organize records in response to a request.
When a public record exists, Ferguson Township will separate and
exclude any records which are not public records or which are
otherwise excluded or exempted from the definition of public records. If
information which is not subject to access is an integral part of a public
record and cannot be separated, Ferguson Township shall redact from
the public record the information which is not subject to access, and the
response shall grant access only to the information which is subject to
access.
7. Response. Within five business days from the date the request is
received, Ferguson Township will (A) provide the records requested; (B)
deny the request by notifying the requestor in writing: or (C) send a
written notice that the records cannot be provided within the five
business days. If it is determined that the request cannot be honored
within the five days, a notice will be issued specifying a date when the
records may be expected, but in no case will the time be longer than 30
additional days. If no response is made within the five business days of
receipt of written request, the request shall be deemed denied.
8. Fees. A request for copies of public records or information produced
therefrom must be accompanied by payment of fees to cover the direct
costs of duplication if the cost of duplication is estimated to be $100 or
more. Reasonable fees to cover direct costs incurred by Ferguson
Township may be charged, as set by the Pennsylvania Office of Open
Records.
9. Denials. If Ferguson Township denies a written request for information,
whether in whole or in part, a written response will be sent by the
Right-To-Know Officer to the requestor with (A) a description of the
record requested, (B) the specific reasons for denial, including a
citation of supporting legal authority, (C) contact information for the
Right-To-Know Officer, (D) date of response, and (E) procedure to
appeal the denial.
10. Appeals.
A. Requestors receiving a denial either in part or whole of a submitted
request have the right to appeal that denial of information in
writing to the Appeals Office, c/o Executive Director, Office of Open
Records, Commonwealth Keystone Building, 400 North Street, 4th
Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17120, for a review. Requestors appealing a
denial of Police Department criminal investigative records have the
right to appeal that denial of information in writing to the Centre

appeals officer, a requestor or Ferguson Township may file a

benefit as set forth in Subsection 4. Note that this benefit is

election to vest will result in a payment of member contributions
and associated earnings in a lump-sum to the former participant
pursuant to § 1-1226.3 of the Plan.
2. Retirement Benefit. A former participant who satisfies the conditions
for entitlement described in the foregoing subsection shall be entitled

to vest his or her retirement benefits by filing with the Township a
written notice of his or her intention to vest within 90 days after he
or she ceases to be an eligible employee. Upon reaching the date
which would have been his or her normal retirement date if he or
she had continued to be employed as an eligible employee, he or
she shall be paid a retirement benefit calculated as set forth in
Subsection 2 with, for the purposes of that calculation, final
average salary being calculated over the final 36 months the former
participant was an eligible employee.
5. Form of Benefit Payment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, a participant hired before January 24, 2001, who gives
at least 30 days' written notice to the Plan Administrator before the
date retirement payments shall commence, may choose to receive
retirement payments in an optional form which is the actuarial
equivalent of the retirement benefit as described in Subsections 2 and
4. The following options may be selected; the joint and survivor annuity
option which shall pay a reduced amount monthly to the participant
until death and if the participant's beneficiary is then living shall pay a
monthly amount to the beneficiary until death equal to 50% or 100% of
the monthly amount paid to the participant, whichever amount shall
have been chosen by the participant.
1. Disability Benefit.
A. A disabled participant shall be entitled to receive a monthly benefit
equal to 100% of the present value of his or her accrued benefit.
This amount shall be offset or reduced by any amounts payable
pursuant to the short-term disability insurance plan funded by the
employer. The disability benefit entitlement shall begin on the first
day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the
date on which the participant has satisfied the Plan's definition of
disability and shall continue, except as noted below, until the
earliest of his/her death or recovery from disability.
§ 1-1223 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1224
FWD:126
B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, for
disabilities incurred after April 17, 2002, which are the result of
injuries incurred in the performance of the participant's duties as a
police officer for the Township, the disability benefit payable to a
participant who meets the requirements of § 1-1222 of the Plan is a
monthly benefit calculated at 50% of the participant's salary
(within the meaning of "salary" under Act 30 of 2002) at the time
the disability was incurred provided that any participant who
receives benefits for the same injuries under the Social Security
Act (42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.) shall have his/her disability benefits
offset or reduced by the amount of such benefits. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Plan, anyone receiving benefits
under this paragraph shall receive no other disability benefits or
retirement benefits under this Plan.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, any disability benefit
payable under this Subsection 1B shall be offset or reduced by any
amounts payable pursuant to the short-term disability plan funded
by the employer.
2. Payment of Disability Benefits. Disability payments shall be made
monthly as of the first day of each month, continuing until the
termination of the disability benefit as provided in Subsection 3 hereof
or attainment of normal retirement age (such a disabled participant
who attains normal retirement age shall thereafter receive a normal
retirement benefit pursuant to § 1-1223). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no disability benefit payments shall be
required to be paid on or before the first day of the month coincident
with or next following the date that is 30 days after the date that the
Administrator receives the certificate of the physician evidencing the
disability, although benefit entitlement shall be retroactive to the first
day of the month immediately following or coincident with the
participant's disability.
3. Termination of the Disability Benefit. The disability benefit described
above shall be terminated:
A. If the Township shall determine, on the basis of a medical
examination by a physician acceptable to the Township (and agreed
to by the disabled participant) that the disabled participant, prior
to his/her normal retirement date, has sufficiently recovered to
return to service. If the Township and the disabled participant
cannot agree on a physician, they shall each select a physician who
will then select a third physician who will make a final binding
decision (The physician determined pursuant to this paragraph
shall be hereinafter referred to as the "selected physician").
B. If the disabled participant refuses to undergo a medical
examination by the selected physician, if so available (if not so
available, the selection process in Subsection 3A above shall be
reinitiated), which may be requested by the Township or the

Administrator; provided that the disabled participant may not be
required to undergo a medical examination more often than once
every six months.
C. If the disabled participant is employed in any capacity as a full-time
or part-time police officer after qualifying for the disability benefit.
D. If the disabled participant recovers from his/her disability and does
not return to service.
From time to time, the Board shall adopt uniform provisions for
disability participants whose disability benefit is terminated
pursuant to the above and for disabled participants who recover
from disability and return to service.
4. Requirement of Notification. A disabled participant who is receiving
benefits from the Plan on account of disability shall be required to
notify the Administrator of any change which may cause a cessation of
entitlement to receipt of such benefits. To the extent a disabled
participant fails to provide immediate notice to the Administrator of any
such change in status and who continues to receive benefits to which
he/she is not entitled from the Plan on account of disability, the
Administrator may take any action necessary to recover any amount
improperly paid, including legal action or the offsetting of such
amounts against future payments on account of retirement or death
under the Plan, including the costs of such actions.
1. Preretirement Death Benefit. In the event that an actively employed
participant shall die, his/her beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a
lump sum benefit equal to the present value of the participant's accrued
benefit, determined as of the date of death. If no beneficiary is selected,
the death benefit shall be payable in a lump sum to his or her estate. If
any benefits are paid pursuant to this subsection no participant, former
participant, member, beneficiary or survivor of any of the foregoing will
be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan.
2. Other Death Benefits. The surviving spouse of an actively employed
participant who dies on or after April 17, 2002, before his/her pension
has vested, and whose survivors are entitled to no benefits under any
other sections of this Plan, or if no spouse survives or if he or she
survives and subsequently dies, the child or children under the age of
18 years, or if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years,
of a participant shall be entitled to receive repayment of his/her
member contributions (including interest at 6% per annum) unless the
participant has designated another beneficiary. Any person or entity
receiving a return of contributions under this subsection will be entitled
to no other benefits under this Plan.

FWD:128
§ 1-1226. Member Contributions and Their Disbursement. [Ord.
892, 10/15/2007, § 1]
3. Retirement Death Benefit. If a former participant who began to receive
pension benefits under this Plan prior to April 17, 2002, dies, there shall
be no death benefit payable from the Plan, except as may be provided
for in the annuity option that was elected by the former participant at
the time of his/her retirement pursuant to Plan § 1-1223.5.
4. Survivor Benefits for Members Who Die After Retiring or After They Are
Eligible to Retire. Effective April 17, 2002, notwithstanding anything in
Subsection 3 to the contrary, if a participant "retires on pension" (within
the meaning of Act 30 of 2002) and dies, a monthly benefit shall be paid
to the surviving spouse or if no spouse survives, of if he or she survives
and subsequently dies, then the child or children under the age of 18
years if attending college, under or attaining the age of 23 years in the
case of a child or children, in the amount of 50% of the monthly pension
benefit the member was receiving or would have been receiving had he/
she been retired at the time of his/her death. For the purposes of this
section, a participant who has attained his/her normal retirement date
and dies prior to retiring shall be treated as if he/she had retired on the
day before his/her death. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Plan, anyone receiving benefits under this subsection shall receive
no other benefits under this Plan. The phrase "attending college" shall
mean the eligible children are registered at an accredited institution of
higher learning and are carrying a minimum course load of seven credit
hours per semester. This Subsection 4, insofar as Act 30 of 2002 affects
the benefits available to surviving spouses, shall apply to surviving
spouses whose spouse died on or before April 17, 2002, and who were
not remarried as of April 17, 2002.
1. Member Contributions, Defined. The term "member contribution" shall
mean any amount deposited into the Plan by a participant.
Contributions may be reduced or eliminated provided that any
reduction or elimination of contributions is authorized on an annual
basis by an ordinance or resolution by the Board. Note: See the
applicable collective bargaining agreement for further details
associated with member contributions, possible relief thereof and
reductions in benefits as permitted by law. Member contributions shall
be subject to the following provisions:
A. To the extent such monies are needed to avoid any member
contributions to the Plan, the employer shall utilize state aid
contributions that it receives due to the existence of the Plan.
B. When contributions are required to maintain the actuarial
soundness of the Plan as determined by the Plan actuary,
participants shall be required to contribute as follows: participants
covered by Social Security may be required to contribute up to 5%
of their compensation: and participants not covered by Social
§ 1-1225 FOREWORD § 1-1226
FWD:129
Security may be required to contribute up to 8% of their
compensation.
Member contributions shall be "picked up" by the employer and
shall be treated as employer contributions for federal income
taxation purposes pursuant to § 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, contributions so picked up
shall be treated as member contributions for all purposes of state
and local law.
2. Crediting of Interest. Interest shall accrue to member contributions at
the rate of 6% per annum. Such interest shall be credited from the
midpoint of the year (or part of the year) when made through the date
of participant's termination of eligible employment.
3. Withdrawal.
A. Member contributions, in addition to the interest accrued thereon,
(hereinafter referred to collectively as the "member contribution
account"), may be withdrawn from the Plan by or on behalf of a
former participant only under the following circumstances:
(1) Where the former participant fails to complete the requirement
of service specified in § 1-1223, Subsection 1A, and where the
former participant fails to elect to vest in a retirement benefit
to which he/she has become entitled, pursuant to § 1-1223,
Subsection 1B.
(2) Where the participant dies without satisfying the requirements
of entitlement to a death benefit, as detailed in § 1-1225, and
where the retirement or disability benefit of such former
participant has not yet commenced.
B. Where the above conditions for the withdrawal of the member
contribution account have been satisfied, payment of the member
contribution account shall be made to the former participant, or in
the event of the former participant's death, to the former
participant's beneficiary, or if a beneficiary does not exist, to the
former participant's estate. Such payment shall commence on or
after the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next
following the date on which the former participant (1) became a
former participant or (2) failed to elect vesting in a retirement
benefit to which he/she had become entitled, whichever is later.
C. Upon the distribution of the member contribution account, the
entitlement of the former participant, his/her spouse, survivors,
children or his/her beneficiary to any future retirement benefit,
disability benefit, or death benefit, shall cease and they shall be
excluded from further participation in the Plan and they shall have
no further rights therein.

by reference. If a benefit payable to a participant under this Plan
would otherwise exceed the limit under Code § 415, the benefit will
be reduced to the maximum permissible benefit.
B. Effective Date. If there is more than one permissible effective date
for any required change in the Code § 415(b) provisions, then the
change shall be effective as of the latest permissible effective date;
however, any adjustment in the dollar limit under Code
§ 415(b)(1)(A), whether required or permissible, shall take effect
automatically as of the earliest permissible effective date. The
"applicable mortality table" in Rev. Rul. 2001-62 effective from
December 31, 2002, through December 31, 2007. Effective as of
January 1, 2008, the "applicable mortality table" and "applicable
interest rate" are found in Rev. Rul. 2007-67.
C. No Reduction in Accrued Benefits. Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this section shall reduce the benefit of
any participant.
D. Multiple Plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(b) or (e), and
if the aggregated benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code § 415(b) or (e), then benefits shall be reduced first under this
Plan. (Historical Note: Code § 415(e) applied for limitation years
beginning prior to 2000.)
E. Mandatory Contributions. Participant contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions
is not included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code § 415(b)
or (e). This paragraph does not apply to contributions "picked-up"
in accordance with Code § 414(h).
F. Permissive Service Credit. Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit [within
the meaning of Code § 415(n)] under the Plan, the benefit derived
from the contributions made to purchase the service credit shall be
treated as part of the benefit subject to the limitations under this
subsection.
6. Limit on Annual Additions.
A. Annual Additions. Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include participant contributions) under this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code § 415(c) and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If an annual addition would
otherwise exceed the limit under Code § 415(c), the excess annual
addition will be eliminated in accordance with methods permitted
under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to 2009) or its
successor.
§ 1-1230 FOREWORD § 1-1230
FWD:137
B. Multiple Plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code § 415(c), and if the
annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under Code
§ 415(c), annual additions will first be reduced under the other
plan. If there is more than one other plan, annual additions will first
be reduced under the Plan with the greatest amount of annual
additions.
C. Effective Date. The limits under which Code § 415(c) are adjusted
periodically in accordance with changes in the law or cost of living
adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If there is
more than one permissible effective date for any required change
relating to Code § 415(c), then the change shall be effective as of
the earliest permissible effective date.
D. 415(c) Compensation. For the purposes of this paragraph,
"compensation" includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(b)1 or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(c), the terms of which are specifically incorporated
herein by reference. Compensation included in this definition does
not fail to be "compensation" [within the meaning of Code
§ 415(c)(3)] merely because it is paid after the employee's
severance from employment with the Township, provided the
compensation is paid by the later of 2.5 months after severance
from employment with the Township or the end of the limitation
year that includes the date of severance from employment with the
Township. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the extent required by
the Heroes Earnings Assistance Tax Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART
Act), differential wage payments shall be included in compensation.
7. Direct Rollovers.
A. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1,
1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary
that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an
eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement
plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
B. For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall
apply:
(1) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except
that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: (a) any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
§ 1-1230 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1230
FWD:138
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period
of 10 years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); (c) the portion
of any distribution that is not includible in gross income
(determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
appreciation with respect to employer securities); and (d)
effective as of January 1, 2002, any hardship distribution.
Effective as of January 1, 2002, clause (c) does not apply
to any after-tax participant contributions that are paid to an
individual retirement account or annuity described in Code
§ 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan
described in Code § 401(a) or 403(a) or effective as of January
1, 2007, any § 403(b) annuity contract that agrees to
separately account for amounts so transferred, including
separately accounting for the portion of such distribution
which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.
(2) An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account
described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity
described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
§ 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), that
accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the
surviving spouse, prior to January 1, 2002, an eligible
retirement plan was an individual retirement account or
individual retirement annuity. Effective as of January 1, 2002,
an "eligible retirement plan" includes an annuity contract
described in Code § 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code
§ 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of
a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political
subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account
for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. Effective
January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA is an "eligible retirement plan."
(3) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p), are
distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse.
(4) A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee.
C. Non-spouse Beneficiaries. Effective as of January 1, 2007, if a
beneficiary who is not a surviving spouse is entitled to receive what
would otherwise be an "eligible rollover distribution," the
beneficiary may, in accordance with Code § 402(c)(11), make a
trustee-to-trustee transfer of that amount to an IRA or individual
§ 1-1230 FOREWORD § 1-1230
FWD:139
retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract); provided,
that:
(1) The transfer is made not later than the end of the fourth year
after the year of the participant's death.
(2) The account or annuity to which the amount is transferred is
treated as an inherited IRA or individual retirement annuity in
accordance with Code § 408(d)(3)(C).
8. Minimum Required Distributions.
A. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the
distribution of a participant's benefits shall be made in accordance
with the requirements and conditions of and shall otherwise
comply with Code § 401(a)(9). For purposes of complying with Code
§ 401(a)(9), life expectancies shall be determined in accordance
with the 1987 proposed regulations prior to January 1, 2003 and
with the final regulations (§§ 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-9)
on or after January 1, 2003.
B. Effective as of January 1, 1997, distribution of a participant's
benefits shall begin not later than April 1 of the calendar year
following the later of:
(1) The calendar year in which the participant attains age 70 1/2.
(2) The calendar year in which the participant retires.
Distributions must be made over a period not exceeding the
life of the participant or the joint lives a participant and his/
her beneficiary.
C. Distributions to a participant and his/her beneficiaries shall only be
made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements
of Code § 401(a)(9)(G) and the regulations thereunder.
D. This subsection does not authorize the payment of any benefit in
any form not permitted under another provision of the Plan.
9. Approved Domestic Relations Orders. Upon approval by the Plan
Administrator of a domestic relations order as an "approved domestic
relations order" all rights and benefits provided to a participant under
this Plan shall be subject to an "approved domestic relations order" to
the extent provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
In no event shall a domestic relations order be approved which expands
the rights and benefits otherwise available to the participant under this
Plan.
10. Credit for Qualified Military Service. Effective as of December 12, 1994,
notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary,
contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified
military service will be provided in accordance Code § 414(u).
§ 1-1230 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1230
FWD:140
§ 1-1231. Amendment and Termination of Pension Plan or Pension
Fund. [Ord. 892, 10/15/2007, § 1]
11. Vesting upon Plan Termination. Upon the termination of this Plan, or
complete discontinuance of contributions [within the meaning of pre-
ERISA Code § 401(a)(7)] to this Plan, each employee as of the date of
such termination or discontinuance shall become vested to the extent
that the Plan is funded.
12. Consent for Lump-Sum Distributions. Effective January 1, 2006,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any distribution to a
participant made prior to the earlier of age 62 or normal retirement age
of an amount in excess of $1,000 that is an eligible rollover distribution
as set forth in the Plan and the code shall be made only upon consent of
the participant.
13. Heroes Earnings Assistance Tax Relief Act of 2008 (HEART Act).
Effective for deaths occurring while performing qualified military
service [as defined in Code § 414(u)] on or after January 1, 2007, the
Plan will provide retirement benefits and service credit to the extent
that the Plan is required and mandated by the Heart Act to provide said
benefits and/or service credit.
1. Amendment. The Board may amend this Plan at any time or from time
to time by ordinance or resolution, provided that:
A. No amendment shall deprive any member or beneficiary, as
applicable, of any of the benefits to which he/she is entitled under
this Plan pursuant to state law.
B. No amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this Plan other than for the benefit of eligible employees or
alternate payees, and no funds contributed to the Plan or assets of
the Plan shall, except as provided below, ever revert to or be used
or enjoyed by the Township except as set forth below.
C. No amendment to the Plan which provides for a modification of one
or more benefits shall be made unless an estimate of cost has been
prepared and presented to the Board.
2. Termination of the Plan. It is the present intention of the employer to
maintain this Plan indefinitely. Nevertheless, the Board shall have the
power to terminate this Plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument
in writing executed in the name of the Township.
3. Automatic Termination of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of
Act 205 governing financially distressed municipalities, the liability of
the Township to make contributions to the pension fund shall
automatically terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the
Township, upon its adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a
general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
§ 1-1230 FOREWORD § 1-1231
FWD:141
§ 1-1232. The Pension Fund. [Ord. 892, 10/15/2007, § 1]
4. Distribution upon Termination. All assets attributable to the terminated
Plan shall be distributed and disposed of in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law and the terms of any instrument adopted by
the Township which effects such termination.
5. Residual Assets. If all liabilities to vested members and any others
entitled to receive a benefit under the terms of the Plan have been
satisfied and there remain any residual assets in the pension fund, such
residual assets remaining shall be returned to the Township insofar as
such return does not contravene any provision of law, and any
remaining balance, in excess of employer contributions and related
earnings, shall be returned to the commonwealth.
6. Exclusive Benefit Rule. In the event of the discontinuance and
termination of the Plan as provided herein, the Township shall dispose
of the pension fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and
applicable law; at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the Plan shall any part of the corpus or income of the pension fund,
after deducting any administrative or other expenses properly
chargeable to the pension fund, be used for or diverted to purposes
other than for the exclusive benefit of the members in the Plan, their
beneficiaries or their estates.
1. Operation of the Pension Fund. The Board is hereby authorized to hold
and supervise the investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject
to the provisions of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
of this Plan and any amendment thereto. The pension fund shall be used
to pay benefits as provided in the Plan and, to the extent not paid
directly by the Township, to pay the expenses of administering the Plan
pursuant to authorization by the Township. The Township intends the
Plan to be permanent and for the exclusive benefit of its employees. It
expects to make the contributions to the pension fund required under
the Plan. The Township shall not be liable in any manner for any
insufficiency in the pension fund; benefits are payable only from the
pension fund, and only to the extent that there are monies available
therein. The pension fund will consist of all funds held by the Township
under the Plan, including contributions made pursuant to the provisions
hereof and the investments, reinvestment and proceeds thereof. The
pension fund shall be held, managed, and administered pursuant to the
terms of the Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan,
the Township has exclusive authority and discretion to manage and
control the pension fund assets. The Township may, however, appoint a
trustee, custodian and/or investment manager, at its sole discretion.
2. Powers and Duties of the Township. With respect to the pension fund,
the Township shall have the following powers, rights and duties, in
addition to those vested in it elsewhere in the Plan or by law, unless
such duties are delegated.
§ 1-1231 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1232
FWD:142
A. To retain in cash so much of the pension fund as it deems advisable
and to deposit any cash so retained in any bank or similar financial

bear interest.
B. To invest and reinvest the principal and income of the fund and

C. To sell property held in the fund at either public or private sale for
cash or on credit at such times as it may deem appropriate; to

exchange thereof.
D. To consent to and participate in any plan of reorganization,
consolidation, merger, extension or other similar plan affecting
property held in the fund; to consent to any contract, lease,
mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any corporation

appropriate for the purposes of this Plan no matter where situated,
including in those cases where a bank has been appointed to serve
as trustee hereunder, the savings department of its own
commercial bank.
H. In addition to the foregoing powers, the Township shall also have
all of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by
the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may
be subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the Township may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.
I. To maintain and invest the assets of this Plan on a collective and
commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans
maintained by the Township, provided that the assets of each
respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
J. To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
§ 1-1232 FOREWORD § 1-1232
FWD:143
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder or to invest in a group contract or other funding
arrangement. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of
this Plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through
such a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of
the Plan which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be
subject to all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust,
as amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan,
to the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the Plan.
K. To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is
appointed by the Township, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the Township.
L. To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.

any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to
the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to
pay; to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against

O. To appoint any persons or firms (including but not limited to
accountants, investment advisors, counsel, actuaries, physicians,
appraisers, consultants, professional plan administrators and other
specialists), or otherwise act to secure specialized advice or
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the Township shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the Township, taking into account the interests of the members and
beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons or
firms to perform their assigned functions.
P. To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
§ 1-1232 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1232
FWD:144
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that
act), or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or
dispose of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one
state; in such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts
nor omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall
it be under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such investment
manager or managers. If the Township appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the Township.
3. Common Investments. The Township shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual members or to maintain separate
investments for each member's account, but may invest contributions
and any profits or gains therefrom in common investments.
4. Compensation and Expenses of Appointed Trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
Township and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his/her functions, shall constitute a charge upon
the Township or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time
after 30 days' written notice to the Township. The Township shall be
under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of
its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to
reimburse themselves for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
5. Periodic Accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the Township, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other
transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
6. Value of the Pension Fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the Township or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the members, spouses, children, survivors and beneficiaries and their
estates. In making any such determination, the Township or trustee
shall be entitled to seek and rely upon the opinion of or any information
furnished by brokers, appraisers and other experts, and shall also be
entitled to rely upon reports as to sales and quotations, both on security
exchanges and otherwise as contained in newspapers and in financial
publications.

FWD:145
§ 1-1233. Miscellaneous Provisions. [Ord. 892, 10/15/2007, § 1]
1. Plan Not a Contract of Employment. No employee of the Township, nor
anyone else, shall have any rights whatsoever against the Township or
the Administrator as a result of this Plan, except those rights expressly
granted to them hereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed to give
any employee the right to remain an employee of the Township.
2. Gender and Number. For purposes of the Plan and wherever plainly
necessitated by the person or context, the masculine shall be read for
the feminine, and the singular shall be read for the plural.
3. Expenses. To the extent permitted by state law, all expenses related to
the operation and administration of the fund and Plan shall be paid from
the assets of the fund.
4. Construction. The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions shall be
determined and construed pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, the federal government, and the agencies thereof.
5. Severability of Provisions. In the event that any provision, section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or other part of the Plan shall
be held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect or impair any
remaining provisions, sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences,
clauses, or other parts of the Plan.
6. Headings. The headings and subheadings employed within the current
document have been inserted for convenience of reference and are to
be ignored in the construction of the provisions hereof.
7. Incapacity of Member. If any member shall be physically or mentally
incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any payment of
benefits hereunder, the Administrator, upon the receipt of satisfactory
evidence that such member is incapacitated to the aforesaid extent and
that another person or institution maintains him/her, may provide for
such payment of benefits hereunder to such person or the institution
maintaining him/her, and any such payments so made shall be deemed
for every purpose to have been made to such member.
8. Protective Clause Relative to Administration. Subject to the provisions
of all laws applicable hereto, and unless otherwise specifically required,
no past, present, or future officer of the Township shall be personally
liable to any participant, beneficiary, or other person under any
provision of the Plan.
9. Sole Benefit. The income and principal of the Plan are for the sole use
and benefit of the members covered hereunder and, to the extent

hereafter incurred by any member, beneficiary, or alternate payee.
§ 1-1233 FERGUSON CODE § 1-1233
FWD:146
§ 1-1234. Early Retirement Benefit.4 [Added by Ord. 1025, 12/5/
2016]
10. Benefits Payable from Other Plans. The pension or retirement benefits
payable hereunder for any month shall be reduced by any pension
benefits from pension plans heretofore established by a private
organization or association for the members, but only to the extent that
the commonwealth or the Township shall have contributed to such
pension plan monies raised by taxation. If the commonwealth or the
Township shall have contributed monies raised by taxation to a pension
plan established by a private organization or association for the
members, the pension benefits shall be used to reduce or offset pension
or retirement benefits paid hereunder only by that proportion of the
total pensions payable by virtue of the assets attributable to
contributions of monies raised by taxation bears to total assets of said
pension plan.
11. Reversion of Contributions. If a contribution is made by the Township
by mistake of fact, the contribution may be returned to the Township
within one year after the payment of the contribution.
12. Spendthrift and Assignment. The pension payments herein provided for
shall not be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or
other legal process, and shall be payable only to the member, his/her
survivors or his/her designated beneficiary, or alternate payee and shall
not be subject to assignment or transfer except as provided in
Subsection 10 hereof.
13. Headings. Any headings or subheadings in this Plan are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction
of any provisions hereunder.
1. A participant with 20 or more years of service who terminates
employment prior to reaching normal retirement date and who files
written application for an early retirement benefit with the Plan
Administrator is eligible for the early retirement benefit. The early
retirement benefit shall become effective as of the date the application
is filed with the Plan Administrator or the date designated on the
application, whichever is later, and shall be the actuarial equivalent of a
partial superannuation retirement benefit calculated as follows:
A. A partial superannuation retirement benefit shall be determined by
applying the percentage that the member's years of service bear to
the years of service that the member would have rendered had the
member continued to be employed until his/her superannuation
retirement date to the gross pension amount calculated using the
gross pension amount calculated using the monthly average during
the appropriate period prior to his/her termination of employment.
4. Editor's Note: This section is effective for employment terminations on or after 1-1-2017.
§ 1-1233 FOREWORD § 1-1234
FWD:147
B. The actuarial equivalent of the partial superannuation retirement
benefit shall be determined by actuarially reducing the partial
superannuation retirement benefit to reflect that it will commence
on the effective date of the early retirement rather than on the date
on which the member would have completed superannuation age
and service requirements. The actuarial reduction shall be
calculated using the actuarial assumptions reported in the last
actuarial valuation report filed with the Public Employee
Retirement Commission under the Act of December 18, 1984 (P.L.
1005, No. 205), known as the "Municipal Pension Plan Funding
Standard and Recovery Act."5
2. The entire provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of Act 24 of 19986 are hereby

The following lighting definitions are selected from the ANSI/IES Lighting
Definitions and the IES Lighting Handbook for ready reference within the
text of this Part:
CANDELA  The SI unit of luminous intensity. One candela is one lumen
per steradian (lm/sr).
CANDLEPOWER  Luminous intensity expressed in candelas.
CUTOFF ANGLE (OF A LUMINAIRE)  The angle, measured up from nadir,
between the vertical axis and the first line of sight at which the bare source
is not visible.
FOOTCANDLE  A unit of illuminance. One footcandle is one lumen per
square foot (lm/ft2).
GLARE  The sensation produced by luminances within the visual field that
is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to
cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance or visibility.
BLINDING GLARE  Glare that is so intense that for an appreciable length
of time after it has been removed, no object can be seen.
DIRECT GLARE  Glare resulting from high luminances or insufficiently
shielded light sources in the field of view.
1. For the purposes of this Part, certain terms and words used herein shall
be interpreted as follows:
A. The word "shall" denotes a mandatory requirement; the word
"should" denotes an advised or recommended provision that is
desirable but not mandatory.
B. The word "includes" or "including" shall not limit the term to the
specific example, but is intended to extend its meaning to all other
instances of like kind and character.
C. Words used in the present tense include the future; words used in
the masculine gender include the feminine and neuter; the singular
number includes the plural and the plural the singular.
§ 4-115 FOREWORD § 4-117
FWD:167
DISABILITY GLARE  The effect of stray light in the eye whereby visibility
and visual performance are reduced.
DISCOMFORT GLARE  Glare that produces discomfort. It does not
necessarily interfere with visual performance or visibility.
REFLECTED GLARE  Glare resulting from reflections of high luminances
in polished or glossy surfaces in the field of view.
ILLUMINANCE  The areal density of the luminous flux incident at a point
on a surface.
ILLUMINATION  An alternative term for illuminance. Commonly used in a
qualitative or general sense to designate the act of illuminating or the state
of being illuminated.
LAMP  A generic term for a man-made source of light.
LIGHT  Radiant energy that is capable of exciting the retina and
producing a visual sensation. The visible portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum extends from about 380 to 770 nanometers.
LIGHT LOSS FACTOR (LLF)  The ratio of illuminance for a given area to
the value that would occur if lamps operated at their initial rated lumen
output and if no system variation or deprecation had occurred.
LIGHT TRESPASS  A subjective perception of undesirable illumination
including the following examples:
LUMEN  SI unit of luminous flux. Photometrically, it is the luminous flux
emitted within a unit solid angle (one steradian) by a point source having a
uniform luminous intensity of one candela.
LUMINAIRE  A complete lighting unit consisting of one or more lamps
(light sources) together with the parts designed to control the light
distribution, and other mechanical and electrical components.
CUTOFF LUMINAIRE  A luminaire light distribution is designated as
cutoff when the candlepower per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically
exceed 25 (2.5%) at an angle of 90° above nadir (horizontal), and 100 (10%)
at a vertical angle of 80° above nadir.
LUMINANCE  The emitted or reflected light from a surface; relates
directly to perceived "brightness." The unit of luminance is the candela per
square meter (cd/m2).
LUMINOUS FLUX  Radiant flux (radiant power); the time rate of flow of
radiant energy evaluated in terms of a standardized visual response.
(1) The classic "light shining in a window."
(2) Unwanted light on an adjacent property.
(3) Excessive brightness in the normal field of vision (nuisance glare).
§ 4-117 FERGUSON CODE § 4-117
FWD:168
LUMINOUS INTENSITY  The luminous flux per unit solid angle in the
direction in question. May be expressed in candelas or lumens per steradian
(lm/sr).
LUX  The S1 unit of illuminance. One lux is one lumen per square meter
(lm/m2).
NIGHTTIME  The hours between the end of evening civil twilight and
the beginning of morning civil twilight. Civil twilight ends in the evening
when the center of the sun's disk is 6° below the horizon, and begins in the
morning when the center of the sun's disk is 6° below the horizon.
SPILL LIGHT  Light shining beyond a facility that may annoy occupants of
the adjacent property.

DAY-TIME  7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
DECIBEL (dB)  A unit of sound level which is a division of logarithmic
scale used to express the ratio of the sound intensity of the source to the
intensity of an arbitrarily chosen reference intensity. The ratio is expressed
on the decibel scale by multiplying its "base ten logarithm" by ten.
EQUIPMENT  Any devices or combination of devices to accomplish a
desired end, such as a chain saw, bulldozer, etc.
EXCESSIVE NOISE  Excessive noise is that sound which is.
FLUCTUATING NOISE  A fluctuating noise is a noise whose sound level
varies significantly with time.
IMPULSIVE NOISE  Impulsive noise is characterized by brief excursions
of sound level. The duration of a single impulse is usually less than one
second.
INTERMITTENT NOISE  An intermittent noise is a noise whose sound
level exceeds the ambient noise levels at least twice during the period of
observation, which is one minute or more. The period of time during which
the level of the noise remains at an essentially constant value different from
that of the ambient is on the order of one second or more.

during which acoustical data are obtained. The period of observation is
determined by the characteristics of the noise being measured and the
instrumentation being used. The period of observation must be at least as
long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the variance
in individual sound level, the longer must be the observation time for a
given expected accuracy of measurement.
S.A.E.  Society of Automotive Engineers.
SOUND LEVEL (NOISE LEVEL)  Airborne sound levels are expressed
in dB and obtained by the use of specific frequency dependent weighting
networks, as specified in the referenced standards. The specific weighting
Injurious or which unreasonably interferes with the comfortable
enjoyment of life and property. Measured noise levels in excess of limits
established in these regulations or those specified in valid permits are
declared to be excessive noise.

an applicant may agree, in writing, to extend the ninety/one-hundredeighty-
day time period for negotiations. It may then be adopted at
the date as permitted by this subsection. If the ninety/one-hundredeighty-
day time elapses without action by the grantor, the applicant
is automatically granted an interim franchise based on the application
submitted. Thereafter, the grantor and applicant may continue to
negotiate the terms of a franchise in an attempt to reach a negotiated
franchise. The ninety/one-hundred-eighty-day time may be tolled by
the grantor if it has requested and not received information from the
applicant.
8. Grant of Additional Franchise and Competing Service.
A. Since competing or overlapping franchises may encourage the
introduction of better cable services and quality at lower prices,
the grantor will at all times attempt to accommodate additional
entrants. At the same time it is recognized that the introduction of
overlapping cable systems could have a potential adverse impact
on the rights-of-way, and on the quality and availability of existing
cable services to the public. Accordingly, the grantor shall issue a
franchise in an area where another grantee is operating only
following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which
the grant of an additional franchise may have on the community
and the rights-of-way. In considering whether to grant one or more
additional franchises, the grantor shall specifically consider, and
address in a written report, the following issues:
(1) Whether or not applicant has provided, at a minimum,
information with its application as required by Subsection 6,
and consideration described in Subsection 7.
(2) The legal, technical, and financial qualifications of applicant
and agreement by a grantee to comply with such requirements
of the grantor as may be determined by it to be applicable to a
grantee in conformance with applicable law.
(3) Acceptance of a franchise and the terms therein.
(4) The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate one or more
additional cable systems and the potential disruption of rightsof-
way and private property that may occur if one or more
additional franchises are granted.
(5) Such other information as the grantor may deem appropriate
to be considered prior to granting any competing or
overlapping franchise.
9. Application for Franchise Renewal. Renewals will be according to valid
applicable law, as amended. A grantor and a grantee, by mutual
consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the
franchise term of a franchise agreement. According to applicable law,
§ 13-204 FOREWORD § 13-204
FWD:279
grantor will review and evaluate the past performance of a grantee,
including compliance with an existing franchise. Also, review and
determination by grantor of current and future community needs and
the technical, financial, and legal capabilities of a grantee to meet
the current and future cable service-related needs in a new franchise
considering the reasonable cost to do so.
10. Permits for Non-franchised Entities. The grantor may issue a license,
easement, or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit
that person to traverse any portion of the rights-of-way for purposes
other than providing cable service. Such license or easement, absent a
grant of a franchise in accordance with this Part, shall not authorize nor
permit said person to provide cable service of any type to any home or
place of business within the grantor nor render any other service within
the grantor except as specifically authorized by grantee.
11. Franchise Provisions.
A. All franchises granted pursuant to this Part are subject to this Part,
including at least the following provisions:
(1) The continuing authority of grantor to impose such other
regulations of general applicability through lawful exercises of
the grantor's police powers as may be determined by the
grantor to be conducive to the health, safety, and welfare of the
public.
(2) The continuing authority of grantor to control and regulate the
use of rights-of-way.
(3) The authority of grantor or its designees upon reasonable
notice to inspect all construction or installation work
performed by a grantee in grantor subject to the provisions of
the franchise and this Part, and to make such inspections as it
will find necessary during regular business hours to insure
compliance with the terms of the franchise, this Part, and
applicable law.
(4) The authority of grantor or its designees to inspect the
financial records related to franchise Fees, maps, plans, and
other like materials of the grantee upon reasonable notice to
insure compliance with the terms of the franchise, this Part,
and applicable law.
(5) The authority of a grantor, upon the revocation or denial of
renewal as provided therein, to require a grantee to remove at
grantee's own expense any and all portions of a cable system
from the rights-of-way within the grantor; provided, however,
grantee shall not be required to remove its cable system, or to
relocate the system, or to sell the system, or any portion
thereof as a result of revocation, denial of renewal, or any
other action to forbid or disallow grantee from providing cable
§ 13-204 FERGUSON CODE § 13-204
FWD:280
services if the system is actively being used to provide noncable
services or other services not regulated under the Cable
Act.
(6) The authority of a grantor to require a franchise fee.
B. Federal, State, and Grantor Jurisdiction.
(1) This Part and any franchise agreement will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable law.
(2) In the event that the state or federal government discontinue
preemption in any area of cable service over which it currently
exercises jurisdiction in such a manner as to expand rather
than limit municipal regulatory authority, the grantor and a
grantee shall in good faith negotiate applicable change to
modify a franchise agreement to comply with the changed law
to ensure competitive equity between a grantee and other
cable operators, taking into account the conditions under
which other cable operators are permitted to provide cable
services to subscribers in the grantor.
(3) This Part will apply to all franchises granted or renewed from
and after the effective date of this Part.
(4) Grantee will not be relieved of grantee's obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this Part or any franchise
agreement granted pursuant to this Part by reason of any
failure of the grantor to enforce prompt compliance.
(5) In the event of a change in applicable law affecting this Part,
the grantor may amend this Part to comply with such change in
applicable law.
C. Franchise Agreement.
(1) By acceptance of a franchise, a grantee acknowledges and
agrees, unless otherwise provided in the franchise, that this
Part in whole and its exhibits are incorporated and made part
of a franchise agreement and shall be a binding contract. In
addition, the franchise agreement accepted by a grantee is
deemed to include the following representations:
(a) Grantee accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this
Part, as to construction, operation, or maintenance of the
cable system, which the grantor may include in the
franchise agreement subject to applicable law.
(b) Grantee has examined all of the provisions of this Part and
agrees that the provisions thereof are valid and binding
and enforceable as of the effective date of the franchise
agreement.
§ 13-204 FOREWORD § 13-204
FWD:281
§ 13-205. Design, Services, and Capabilities. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008,
§ 5]
(c) Grantee recognizes the right of the grantor to adopt such
additional regulations of general applicability as it will find
necessary in the exercise of the grantor's police power.
Any amendment to the grantor code binding on grantee
shall be confined to changes which do not materially alter
the rights and obligations of grantee granted under a
franchise agreement.
(2) The franchise agreement will contain such further conditions
or provisions as may be included in the proposal of a grantee
and negotiated between the grantor and a grantee. In case of
such conflict or ambiguity between any terms or provisions of a
franchise agreement and this Part, the franchise agreement
will control.
1. Cable System Design. Every grantee shall offer cable service that meets
the cable-related needs of the grantor in accordance with applicable
law. The franchise shall include a description of the grantee's cable
system including the general design and capabilities of the cable
system to identify how the cable system will meet the current and
future cable needs of the grantor and the schedule for commencement
and completion of construction. Every grantee shall have responsibility
for the design and maintenance of a cable system including subscriber
premises equipment, unless the equipment is owned by the subscriber.
Every grantee will provide notices regarding the use and operation of
any equipment to be operated by subscribers in accordance with
federal law.
2. System Description and Maps. A grantee shall provide the grantor,
upon written request, a complete set of cable system location maps of
the service area, on which will be shown those areas within the grantor
which its cable system exists and the description and location of all
rights-of-way within which the cable system has been constructed.
These maps shall be provided to the grantor in hard copy and, if
available, electronic format. Updated maps shall be delivered to the
grantor within 30 days after a request is made.
3. Biannual Technology Review. It is recognized that technology is rapidly
changing and that subsequent to its initial construction, further
modifications to incorporate increased channel capacity with
compression technology, fiber optics and other unidentified
technologies which materially affect the capability of the system to offer
new and additional services such as interactive television, video on
demand and similar services, will be desirable. No more than once
every two years, the grantor or its representatives, with the
cooperation and assistance of a grantee, may conduct a full compliance
review, including possible public hearing, with respect to whether
grantee has complied with the material terms of the franchise
§ 13-204 FERGUSON CODE § 13-205
FWD:282
agreement, so long as it provides grantee with 90 days' written notice
in advance of the commencement of any such review or public hearing.
4. Grantor, Installation and General Line Extension Policy.
A. A grantee providing initial cable service within a grantor shall
serve all residential areas as described in the franchise agreement
and shall extend cable system and cable service to contiguous
areas upon request of the grantor when a density of 30 homes per
cable mile is reached. In a renewed franchise, the franchise
agreement will provide a description of the grantee's current
service area. Grantee will extend cable service to contiguous areas
which have 30 homes per cable mile Nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent a grantee from serving areas not covered
under this section upon agreement with developers, property
owners, commercial and business establishments, or residents.
B. Subscribers who request installation or maintenance or repairs
shall be given an "appointment window" for installations, service
calls, and other installation activities at a specific time or, at a
maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours.
(The grantee may schedule service calls and other installation
activities outside of normal business hours for the convenience of
the customer). Persons requesting installation of residential cable
service shall be afforded a right of rescission between the time
cable service is requested and the time service is actually installed.
All standard installations, reconnects, service upgrades or
downgrades shall be performed within seven working days of the
date the order was placed by the subscriber unless a line extension
is required, in which event cable service shall be extended in
accordance with Subsection 4D. Standard installations are those
that are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution system
or the distribution system to be built in compliance with this
Subsection 4.
C. Only those homes which require drops in excess of 125 feet shall be
required to pay for grantee's materials and labor costs, at the rate
per foot. All other installations shall be performed at no more than
the advertised normal installation rate.
D. Grantee shall extend cable service to any residence(s) upon the
written request of one or more residents who shall reside within
the requested extension area and who shall agree to subscribe to
grantee's cable service where the number of occupied homes, and
homes for which certificates of occupancy have been issued, which
would be served by the requested extension equals seven homes
per 1/4 cable mile or more with the measurement starting from the
closest existing usable point of connection to the system. Unless
additional time has been agreed to by the grantor, such extensions
shall be completed within 90 days of submittal of a request
(weather permitting) where the above density standard is met and
§ 13-205 FOREWORD § 13-205
FWD:283
all additional utility permits or other right-of-way permits have
been obtained. The grantor and grantee may agree to a different
time for extension in particular instances.
E. If the number of homes per 1/4 cable mile is less than seven, the
requesting subscriber(s) may obtain service by paying a share of
the incremental cost of the extension as follows:
(1) Grantee shall pay a share of costs calculated as the fraction
derived from the existing density as calculated above divided
by seven homes per 1/4 mile; requesting subscriber(s) share
shall equal the remainder. For example, if the existing density
is three homes per 1/4 mile, grantee shall pay 40% of the
extension cost and the requesting subscriber(s) shall pay the
remaining 60%.
(2) When grantee receives a request for an extension, the grantee
shall, within 30 days, respond in writing with its calculation of
the density and such other terms as may be needed to fully
inform subscriber(s), including cost sharing and
reimbursement procedures. If the density is less than seven
homes per 1/4 mile, grantee shall also provide a firm price
good for 90 days reflecting the proportional share which the
requesting subscriber(s) must pay on a cost sharing basis to
obtain cable service. Within 90 days from payment of the cost
share by prospective subscriber(s) and receipt of all necessary
utility permits or other right-of-way permits, grantee shall
complete the extension of service. A franchise may include a
description of the cost sharing policy in place if different than
what is described in this section.
F. Nothing in this Subsection 4 shall prohibit the grantor, the grantee,
or real estate developers from entering into an agreement whereby
entire new housing developments in the grantor shall be pre-wired
for efficient future expansion of cable service.
5. Interconnection. In accordance with applicable law, including FCC
rules, and the purposes of allowing for public access and EG access
programming telecasts on cable systems serving subscribers in the
grantor and adjoining communities, a grantee will not interfere with
additional connections by other cable operators at studio or
transmission source for public access and/or EG access programming
telecasts in the grantor. Such connections shall be made by direct
return line connection or other appropriate methods independent of a
grantee's cable system.
6. Provision of Service.
A. After cable service has been established by activating trunk and
distribution cable for any area, grantee shall make a standard
installation to any requesting subscriber within that area seven
days from the date of request.
§ 13-205 FERGUSON CODE § 13-205
FWD:284
B. A grantee, upon written request of grantor, shall install and provide
basic service as described in a franchise agreement, (excluding
pay-per-view television and non-video services) to all public
buildings designated by grantor in a franchise at no charge for
either the initial normal installation or for monthly service provided
at each location. Each of these installations should include one
signal drop, one outlet, and one converter (or such other terminal
equipment as may be necessary to provide an electronic interface
with a television receiver). The public buildings to be provided this
complimentary service shall include public buildings currently
connected to and receiving complimentary basic service; public
buildings as described in a franchise; or any such newlyconstructed
public buildings.
C. If more than one outlet is required at any public building as
described in a franchise, grantee shall install such other outlets at
the cost charged to other institutional facilities for installation and
ongoing service. The distribution of the cable system inside such
buildings shall be the responsibility of the user.
D. If required by grantor under the franchise, grantee will make
available, without charge, one free cable modern service outlet to
all school buildings and public libraries. The specific locations shall
be identified in the franchise agreement. For the purposes of this
section, the term "school" means an educational institution that
receives funding pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., as
amended and does not mean "home schools."
7. Technical Standards. A cable system of a grantee shall be designed,
constructed and operated so as to meet those technical standards
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission relating to
cable systems contained in Part 76 of the Federal Communications
Commission's rules and regulations relating to cable systems and found
in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, §§ 76.601 to 76.617, as
amended, or as may, from time to time, be amended. The results of tests
required by the Federal Communications Commission must be filed
with the grantor within 10 business days of written request.
8. Special Testing.
A. At any time after commencement of service to subscribers upon 30
days written notice, and in the presence of a representative of the
grantee, the grantor may require or may retain an independent
engineer to perform additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, or
tests involving a specific subscriber's drop. Such additional tests
will be made on the basis of complaints received or other evidence
indicating an unresolved controversy or significant noncompliance,
and such tests will be limited to the particular matter in
controversy.
§ 13-205 FOREWORD § 13-205
FWD:285
§ 13-206. Conditions for Use of Rights-of-Way and Construction.
[Ord. 907, 8/18/2008, § 6]
B. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its requests for such
special tests during regular business hours so as to minimize
hardship or inconvenience to grantee or to the subscriber. The
rights and obligations of the grantor and grantee under this section
shall at all times be subject to applicable law and FCC regulation.
1. Construction. Grantee shall comply with all generally applicable codes
and ordinances with respect to construction within rights-of-way, and
shall obtain all necessary permits and licenses required by federal,
state and local law, ordinances and rules as required of other like users
of the rights-of-way, before commencing construction in grantor rightsof-
way. A grantee shall furnish to grantor a written description of its
system, including the size, appearance, and location of aboveground
facilities, boxes, pedestals, and equipment being installed under their
permit. The grantor may review the submittal for compliance with the
grantor ordinances and include this as an exhibit in a franchise. This
requirement shall not be interpreted or construed in any way to require
a grantee to obtain from grantor prior approval, authorization, permits,
or licenses to repair above-ground appurtenances, pedestals, and
similar equipment or replace with facilities of the same or comparable
size, or to perform maintenance or repairs on any part of the system
where the right-of-way is not being disturbed.
2. Compliance with Laws. As a minimum, and without limitation, grantee
shall adhere to the grantor's generally-applicable ordinances relating to
rights-of-way construction and use safety standards and all building and
zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the grantor. The
construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be
effectuated by grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws,
ordinances and construction standards of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, all applicable industry standards, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, FCC, and the Standards of Good
Engineering Practices for Measurement of Cable Systems of the
National Cable Television Association to the extent applicable, as well
as all other valid generally applicable laws, rules, regulations and
ordinances, federal, state and local, as the same may be modified or
amended from time to time, pursuant to the grantor's legitimate
exercise of its police powers.
3. Minimum Interference. A grantee shall construct and maintain its cable
system so as to minimize any adverse impact on public improvements or
facilities of others in a rights-of-way and which will not unnecessarily
interfere with the usual and customary uses in the rights-of-way.
4. Erection of Poles Prohibited Without Approval.
A. A grantee shall not erect, for any reason, any pole on or along any
rights-of-way or in an existing aerial utility system without the prior
§ 13-205 FERGUSON CODE § 13-206
FWD:286
approval of the grantor or owner of the facilities proposed to
be attached to. A grantee shall negotiate with the grantor or, as
applicable, any private utility and furnish grantor with a copy of a
current pole attachment agreement or agreement for conduit use,
or both, before commencement of construction.
B. Above-ground location of cable system and related facilities shall
generally be located where reasonable and safe and in a manner
that will not adversely affect the grantor or other public or private
property.
5. Reservations of Rights-of-Way. Nothing herein or in a franchise shall be
construed to prevent the grantor from constructing sewers, grading,
paving, repairing or altering any rights-of-way, or laying down,
repairing or removing water mains or constructing or establishing any
other public work. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in
such manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and
operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances
of grantee. If any such facilities of grantee shall interfere with the
construction or repair of any rights-of-way or public improvement, then
upon 30 days' written notice all such property of the grantee shall be
removed or replaced in such manner as shall be directed by the grantor
so that the same shall not interfere with the public works of the grantor.
Such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of grantee. The
grantee shall at all times have the right to abandon its property.
However, any such abandonment shall be in accordance with pole
attachment agreements, a franchise, and valid applicable state, federal
and local law.
6. Underground Installation. In those areas within the grantor where
cable system facilities and other utilities are currently placed
underground, all cable system facilities shall remain or be placed
underground. In areas where telephone and electric utility facilities are
above ground at the time of a grantee's installation, grantee may install
its cable system facilities above ground, provided that at such time as
both electric and telephone utility facilities are placed underground,
grantee shall likewise place its cable system facilities underground
without cost to the grantor. Nothing contained in this section shall
require grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any
ground-mounted appurtenances.
7. New Subdivision. A grantee shall offer cable services to residential
development constructed or erected after the date of this Part;
provided, the dwelling units meet the density requirement specified
herein. The developer or subdivider developing any residential
development within the grantor shall give advance written notice to
grantee of the beginning of excavation for or construction of off-site
improvements in any residential development to enable installation of
such conduit, pedestals, substructures and other equipment as may be
necessary to provide cable service to the residential units in such a
development so as to provide minimal interference with surface
§ 13-206 FOREWORD § 13-206
FWD:287
improvements. The same density requirements shall apply as defined
in this Part. If the developer gives the grantee adequate notice (as
defined below), then grantee shall be obligated to install all cable lines
underground at the time the subdivision is constructed rather than
when the individual lots are actually occupied.
In cases of new construction or property development where utilities
are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall
give the grantee at least 10 days' written notice of such construction or
development, and of the particular date on which open trenching will
be available for the grantee's installation of conduit and/or cable. The
grantee shall provide specifications as needed for trenching.
Cost of trenching and easements required to bring cable service to
the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner;
provided, however, if the grantee fails to install its conduit and/or
cable within 10 working days of the date the trenches are available,
as designed in the notice given by the developer or property owner,
and the trenches are closed after the five-day period, the cost of new
trenching shall be borne by the grantee.
8. Property Damage and Repair.
A. Grantee shall endeavor to minimize the occurrence of damage to
improvements in the rights-of-way and all public and private
property. If damage occurs, grantee shall promptly notify the
property owner within seven days in writing. Whenever the grantee
disturbs or damages any rights-of-way, other public property or any
private property, the grantee shall promptly restore the property to
a condition reasonably comparable to that existing immediately
prior to the disturbance. In addition, if grantee is restoring rightsof-
way, it shall do so in accordance with all applicable
requirements. If restoration is not satisfactorily performed by the
grantee within a reasonable time, the grantor may, after prior
written notice to the grantee, or without notice where the
disturbance or damage may create a risk to public health or safety,
cause the repairs to be made and recover the costs of those repairs
from grantee. Within 30 days of receipt of an itemized proof of
payment of those costs, including the cost of labor, materials and
equipment, the grantee shall pay the grantor.
B. Upon completion of work which caused any disturbance or damage
to private property, grantee shall promptly commence restoration
and will use its best efforts to commence the restoration within 72
hours of written notice from grantor, weather permitting and
considering the nature of the work that must be performed.
Grantee shall also perform such restoration in accordance with any
customer service standards required by a franchise.
C. When grantee excavates the surface of any rights-of-way, grantee
shall be responsible for restoration of such excavation in
§ 13-206 FERGUSON CODE § 13-206
FWD:288
accordance with all grantor general ordinances, rules, regulations
and standards. Throughout the term of its franchise, grantee's
cable system and related facilities, including above-ground
pedestals, vaults, boxes, generators, power supplies or structures
of any kind, shall be maintained in proper order and repair.
D. Upon completion of restoration in any area, grantee will notify the
grantor.
E. If grantee enters private property for the purposes of construction
where there is no dedicated public easement, grantee shall first
secure the private property owner's consent.
9. Permit Requirements.
A. Subject to the generally applicable ordinances of grantor, a
franchise and this Part establishes the general rules and scope of
authority for grantee to construct and maintain and operate its
cable system within the rights-of-way of the grantor. Grantee shall
designate a responsible contact person including a telephone
number available seven days a week, 24 hours a day, with whom
representatives of the grantor can communicate with on all matters
relating to cable system installation, construction, operation, and
maintenance.
B. Prior to any excavation within the rights-of-way, a grantee shall
obtain a permit, pay all applicable fees, and perform such work in
accordance with applicable provisions of a franchise, and/or other
applicable ordinances or regulations with respect to excavation
work. Notwithstanding the above, no permit shall be required for
cable service drops for individual subscribers, servicing of
pedestals, or other routine maintenance of the cable system that
does not result in surface disturbance of the public right of way as
outlined in Subsection 1.
C. A grantee must be current with all requirements of this Part and all
franchise requirements, including payment of required fees and
charges and insurance before a permit is issued by grantor.
10. Cable System Drawings. Grantee shall keep and maintain accurate
records and as-built drawings of its cable system constructed,
reconstructed, or relocated within the grantor's rights-of-way in
accordance with § 13-205, Subsection 2, of this Part grantee shall
cooperate promptly and fully with the grantor and take all reasonable
measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information
regarding the nature and location of its cable system located within the
rights-of-way when requested by the grantor to facilitate public
improvements. Such location maps and information shall be at the sole
expense of grantee without expense to a grantor, its employees, agents,
or authorized contractors.
§ 13-206 FOREWORD § 13-206
FWD:289
§ 13-207. Service Provisions. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008, § 7]
11. Grantee Responsible for Costs. All earth, materials, sidewalks, pavings,
crossings, utilities, public improvements, or improvements of any kind
disturbed or removed by a grantee in its activities under its franchise
shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by a grantee and as
required elsewhere in this Part and the franchise agreement and as may
be required in accordance with applicable grantor's streets and
sidewalks design standards and state law. Any such repair or
replacement shall be at grantee's sole expense and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the grantor or owner thereof.
12. Procedure for Enforcement and Administration Relating to
Construction. The grantor has the responsibility to manage and control
use of the rights-of-way or utility easements within the grantor's
jurisdictional boundaries. In accordance with applicable law, including
ordinances of general application, the grantor has the authority to
administer and enforce rights-of-way construction standards for
grantee's cable system on a non-discriminatory basis, including the
authority to collect permit fees, review plans, and enforce the
provisions of a franchise, and, may utilize the assistance of qualified
independent third parties.
A. Upon reasonable notice, the grantor has the right to inspect all
construction or installation work performed subject to the
provisions of this Part and applicable franchises of the grantor; and
to make such tests as they it shall find necessary to ensure
compliance with the terms of a franchise and applicable
requirements of the grantor; provided, however, a representative of
grantee is present for all such testing, which shall occur during
normal business hours (generally between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
and 5:00 p.m.).
B. Nothing in this Part or a franchise granted pursuant to it gives
permission to use the poles, conduit or other facilities of the
grantor or others. A separate agreement for such use or connection
shall be the responsibility of grantee.
13. Work Performed by Others.
A. A grantee shall make available, upon request, to the grantor the
names and addresses of any person, contractor, subcontractor,
agent, representative or entity other than the grantee, which
performs services pursuant to a franchise; provided, however, that
all provisions of this Part and a franchise remain the responsibility
of a grantee.
B. All provisions of a franchise shall apply to any of a grantee's
subcontractors or others performing any work or services pursuant
to the provisions of a franchise.
§ 13-206 FERGUSON CODE § 13-207
FWD:290
1. Parental Control Device. Upon request by any subscriber, grantee shall
make available at grantee's actual cost a parental control or lockout
device compatible with the subscriber's equipment that will enable the
subscriber to block access to any or all channels in accordance with
§§ 640 and 641 of the Cable Act.
2. Leased Access Channels. Leased access channels shall be provided in
accordance with § 612 of the Cable Act. A leased access channel need
not be activated or otherwise made available for any particular user
until such time as an agreement with respect to charges for said
channel has been reached between grantee and said user. Grantee shall
charge no more for said channel use than that amount allowed under
federal or state law.
3. Emergency Use and Safety Alert. The grantee shall comply with all
emergency or disaster notification requirements in accordance with
and at the time required by the provisions of the then applicable valid
law, including FCC Regulations [47 CFR Part 11, FCC Rules and
Regulations, Emergency Alert System (EAS)] and provisions relating to
the grantor's Emergency Operations Plan (35 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 7101-7707)
and the Pennsylvania Amber Alert System (35 P.S. § 7025.1 et seq.).
4. Institutional Network.
A. A grantee shall-if required in the franchise agreement-construct,
activate, and thereafter maintain an institutional network capable
of transmitting two-way voice, data and video signals. A specific
plan shall be made part of a franchise agreement.
B. The institutional network shall be designed and constructed so as
to interconnect public buildings including educational institutions,
grantor facilities, libraries, police and fire departments and other
institutions as designated by grantor.
5. Access Channels.
A. If required in the franchise agreement, the grantee shall make
bandwidth on its cable system available for up to two downstream
channels for noncommercial access programming use. Channel
capacity for public access shall be provided if required in a
franchise and approved unanimously by the CACC. Additional PEG
channel capacity shall be made available when, over a period of six
consecutive months, 60% of the prime time (7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.
each evening) on the existing access channel(s) on average are
fully occupied with locally-produced access channel programming.
Such additional channel availability will be provided within 180
days of the grantor's certification of such use and written request
for additional channel(s). Grantee shall offer to each of its
subscribers who receive all or any part of the cable services offered
on the system, reception of the access channels. No charges shall
be made for channel time or playback of prerecorded
programming. Management of the access channels programming
§ 13-207 FOREWORD § 13-207
FWD:291
shall be the responsibility of the grantor, and not the responsibility
of the grantee.
B. It shall be the grantee's sole responsibility to provide the cable,
wire, lines and/or other necessary signal distribution equipment
such that live or playbacks of access channel programming can be
received from the selected production location and be distributed
via the cable system to subscribers in the grantor. These cables,
wires, lines and other signal distribution equipment shall be
collectively known as the "return line."
C. Access channels may also be used by grantee, when such channel
or channels are not being used by grantor for access programming
and provided that such channel usage is subject to grantor
approval and displacement by grantor upon 180 days' prior written
notice to the grantee if there is demand to use the access channel.
D. The grantee shall be responsible for the technical maintenance
and, signal quality of such channels. Signal quality on such
channels shall be commensurate with those which apply to the
grantee's regular commercial channels and the grantee shall, upon
request, provide copies of FCC signal quality proofs of performance
with respect to those channels.
6. Access Channel Funding, Facilities, and Equipment.
A. The grantee shall provide financial support permissible under
applicable law as an equipment replacement and facilities capital
grant payable by grantee to grantor to support the cost of facilities
and equipment for development of programming for playback on
access channels in the amount and payable in a manner described
in a franchise, and may be itemized and passed through to the
subscribers. The grantor shall own and maintain all equipment
purchased with equipment funding.
B. The grantee will provide access channel support as specifically
agreed to in the franchise agreement; and to periodically inspect
and maintain the return line to ensure that the technical quality of
the retransmitted access programming signal meets FCC
regulations. The grantee will not engage in any editorial control of
the content of programming on an access channel on the cable
system, except as otherwise required or permitted by law. The
grantor shall be solely responsible for the use of the access
channels and shall indemnify and hold harmless the grantee from
any and all claims, demands, actions and damages (including
attorney's fees) arising from the use or operation of the access
channels.
C. Use of a channel position for public, educational, and/or
governmental ("PEG") access shall be provided on the most basic
tier of service offered by grantee in accordance with the Cable Act,
and a franchise agreement.
§ 13-207 FERGUSON CODE § 13-207
FWD:292
§ 13-208. Operation and Reporting Provisions. [Ord. 907, 8/18/
2008, § 8]
D. Grantee shall insure that all access channels meet the technical
standards of the FCC; provided, however, grantee shall not be
responsible for defects, flaws or other impairments in the access
channel programming delivered to grantee and shall only be
responsible for maintenance for facilities and equipment under its
control applicable to the playback of programming on access
channels of a grantee's system.
E. If grantee makes changes to its cable system that necessitate
modifications to access channel(s) signal transmission facilities and
equipment (including but not limited to the upstream paths),
grantee shall provide reasonable advance notice of such changes to
the grantor and shall provide, at grantee's expense, any additional
or modified headend facilities necessary to implement such
modifications within a reasonable period of time prior to the date
that the system changes are to be made.
F. Upon request by the grantor, the access channels shall be made
available in digital formats comparable to commercial offerings at
the time grantee converts 60% of its system to digital transmission.
1. Open Books and Records. The grantor shall have the right to inspect,
upon 30 days' written notice, at any time during normal business hours
at the system office all books, records, maps, plans, financial
statements that directly relate to the franchise, cable service complaint
logs ("trouble calls" that have generated a work order and/or
necessitated a response originating from the grantor received during
the prior twelve-month period), performance test results, and other like
materials of grantee that relate directly to the terms and conditions of
the franchise. Said books and records shall be made available for
inspection at the local business office of grantee. Upon proper request
by a grantee and pursuant to § 13-202, Subsection 5, herein,
information obtained during such an inspection shall be treated as
confidential, making it available only to those persons who must have
access to perform their duties on behalf of the grantor, including but
not limited to financial personnel, Solicitor's office, and members of the
governing body, if it is proprietary in nature or within the definitions of
closed records contained within the Pennsylvania Open Meetings Act,
§ 610.010 et seq., as amended from time to time. To the extent any
federal requirement for privacy applies to the information to be
submitted said law shall control.
2. Communications with Regulatory Agencies. Copies of all petitions,
applications, communications and reports submitted by a grantee or on
behalf of or relating to grantee to the FCC or any other federal or state
regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any
matters affecting the system authorized pursuant to this franchise shall
also be submitted to the grantor upon written request. Copies of
§ 13-207 FOREWORD § 13-208
FWD:293
responses from the regulatory agencies to grantee shall likewise be
furnished to the grantor within 30 days of receipt of the response.
3. Annual Report. Upon written request, grantee shall provide to the
grantor within 30 days of such request:
A. A current financial statement for the immediately preceding fiscal
year including an income statement, statement of operating
expenses in detail, a cash flow statement and a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting

of the most recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Annual Report Form 10-K prepared by grantee shall be deemed as
a satisfactory compliance of this section.
B. A description of all tiers or levels of service being offered together
with a description of any changes made in any service during the
reporting year.
C. A current copy of the subscriber service information required in
this Part.
D. A trouble call report or compilation summarizing the complaints
received during the reported year by category, number for each

In any request for information pursuant to this section, the grantor
shall specifically identify the information to be provided by
grantee to the grantor.
4. Additional Reports. Grantee shall prepare and furnish to the grantor, at
the times and in the form prescribed, such additional reports, which are
deemed by the parties as reasonably necessary for the administration
and enforcement of this Part and a franchise.
5. Maps. Grantee shall maintain on file with the grantor at all times a
current map or set of maps, either via paper or electronic format, drawn
to scale showing the location of the system and all equipment installed
or in place in rights-of-way and other public places. The maps shall be
updated and made available in accordance with § 13-205, Subsection 2,
herein above.
§ 13-208 FERGUSON CODE § 13-208
FWD:294
6. Audit. The grantor and their agents and representatives shall have the
authority, during normal business hours, to arrange for and conduct an
inspection of the books and records of grantee related to the payment of
the franchise fee. Grantee shall first be given 30 days' written notice of
the audit request, the description of and purpose for the inspection and
description, to the best of the grantor's ability. To the extent such books,
records or documents contain confidential information as defined in
Subsection 1 of this section, such confidential information may not be
disclosed, as described in Subsection 1.
7. Periodic Evaluation, Review and Modification. The field of cable service
and technology is a relatively new and rapidly changing one which may
see many regulatory, technical, financial, marketing and legal changes
during the term of a franchise agreement. Therefore, in order to
provide for a maximum degree of flexibility in a franchise, and to help
achieve a continued advanced and modern cable system, the following
evaluation provisions will apply:
A. The grantor may require, at its sole discretion upon 45 days'
written notice, evaluation sessions at any time during the term of a
franchise; provided, however, there shall not be more than one
evaluation session during any three calendar years.
B. Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation session include,
but are not limited to grantee's ability to comply with the legal,
financial, and technical requirements of the franchise; and meet
the cable-related needs of the community, and any other cablerelated
topics the grantor or a grantee deem relevant.
C. During an evaluation session, a grantee shall fully cooperate with
the grantor and shall provide without cost such information and
documents as the grantor may request to perform the evaluation.
To the extent such information or documents contain confidential
information as defined in Subsection 1 of this section such
confidential information may not be disclosed.
D. If at any time during its evaluation, the grantor determines that a
historical record of evidence exists of cable system performance
which fails to meet the requirements of this Part, the grantor may
require a grantee to perform tests and analysis directed toward
such suspected inadequacies at a grantee's expense. A grantee
shall fully cooperate with the grantor in performing such testing
and any report prepared by a grantee shall include at least:
(1) A description of the problem in the cable system performance
which precipitated the special tests.
(2) The cable system component tested.
(3) The equipment used and procedures employed in testing.
§ 13-208 FOREWORD § 13-208
FWD:295
§ 13-209. Consumer Protection Provisions. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008,
§ 9]
(4) The method, if any, by which the cable system performance
problem was resolved.
(5) If, after receiving a grantee's report, the grantor determines
that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate cable system
performance, the grantor may enlist an independent engineer
to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected
failures to meet the requirements of this franchise. A grantee
shall be a witness to and cooperate and permit said testing.
E. As a result of a periodic review and evaluation session, the grantor
or a grantee may determine that a change in the terms of the
franchise should be required to meet the cable-related needs of the
community, as determined by the grantor's governing body, that the
cable system or franchise requirements should be updated,
changed, revised, or that additional cable service should be
provided and that to provide same would be technically and
economically feasible. If the change is consistent with the terms of
this Part or the franchise, the needs of the grantor, and is
technically and economically feasible as determined following an
evaluation of a grantee's financial condition, length of term
remaining on the franchise, economic waste, if any, that would
occur should the terms be changed, and rate of return on the
investment within the community, the parties will in good faith,
review the terms of the proposed change and any amendment to
this Part or a franchise. Based on this review, and upon adoption of
such a change or new requirement through a mutually agreed upon
and acceptable amendment, the change will become effective.
1. Approval of Changes. The grantor reserves the right to regulate rates
for basic service and any other services offered over the cable system,
to the extent provided by federal or state law. In accordance with the
Cable Act, grantee shall maintain on file with the grantor at all times a
current schedule of all rates and charges.
2. Subscriber Complaint Practices. At all times, a grantee shall meet the
requirements of the Federal Communications Commission regulations
on consumer complaints and protection. However, at a minimum and in
accordance with 47 CFR 76.309, as amended, a grantee shall comply
with the following:
A. A grantee shall maintain a conveniently-located local office within
the CACC service area which shall be open during normal business
hours. This office shall accept payments, handle adjustments to
subscriber bills, respond to installation, repair, and/or maintenance
requests and other service calls. A grantee shall have a toll-free
telephone number available at all times (an access line which will
be available to its subscribers 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week).
§ 13-208 FERGUSON CODE § 13-209
FWD:296
Trained company representatives shall be available to respond
to customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours.
Except in situations beyond its control, the grantee must begin
working on a service interruption or other service problems no
later than 24 hours after being notified of the problem. If the
problem cannot be resolved within 24 hours, the customer shall
be entitled upon request to a credit for one day's service for each
day of the outage. Under normal operating conditions, telephone
answer time by a customer representative, including wait time,
shall not exceed 30 seconds when the connection is made, and the
customer will receive a busy signal less than 3% of the time. If
the call needs to be transferred, transfer time shall not exceed 30
seconds. These standards shall be met no less than 90% of the time
under normal operating conditions, measured on a quarterly basis.
A grantee shall not be required to acquire equipment or perform
surveys to measure compliance with these standards unless an
historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply.
After normal business hours, the access line may be answered by a
service or an automated response system.
B. A grantee may impose a charge reasonably related to a grantee's
actual cost incurred for a downgrade of service, except that no
such charge may be imposed when:
(1) A subscriber requests total disconnection from the cable
system.
(2) A subscriber requests the downgrade within a thirty-day
period following any rate increase relative to the service in
question.
C. A grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and
interrupt cable service only for good cause and for the shortest
time possible. Such interruptions shall occur during periods of
minimum use of the cable system.
D. A grantee shall maintain adequate telephone lines and personnel to
respond in a timely manner to schedule service calls and answer
subscriber complaints or inquiries as required by this Subsection
2.
E. Subscriber requests for repairs of service interruptions shall be
responded to by a trained customer service representative on the
next business day. A grantee shall use best efforts to begin working
on service interruptions promptly and in no event later than 24
hours after the interruption becomes known. A grantee shall begin
actions to correct other service problems the next business day
after notification of the service problem.
F. Subscriber requests for maintenance or repairs received on
Saturdays or Sundays shall be responded to by a customer service
representative on the next business day. A grantee shall use its best
§ 13-209 FOREWORD § 13-209
FWD:297
efforts to begin working on service interruptions promptly and in
no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes known.
Grantee shall begin actions to correct other service problems the
next business day after notification of the service problem.
G. Service calls for maintenance or repair shall be performed in
accordance with the standards established by the FCC.
H. A grantee shall maintain an "appointment window" alternative for
installations, service calls and other installation activities that will
be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block
during normal business hours. A grantee shall not cancel an
appointment with a customer after the close of business on the
business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a customer
service representative is running late for an appointment with a
customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as
scheduled, the customer shall be contacted. The appointment shall
be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the
customer.
3. Installation. A grantee shall make service available to all grantor
residents based on the terms and conditions outlined in § 13-205 of this
Part.
4. Subscriber Information.
A. A grantee shall provide to all new subscribers and, at least once a
year, to existing subscribers, and upon request of a subscriber,
written subscriber service information which shall include, but not
be limited to, the following:
(1) Products and services offered by grantee.
(2) Prices and options for programming services, including
programming carried on the system such that the
programming information corresponds to channel positioning.
(3) Channel positions and programming carried on the cable
system.
(4) Installation policy and service maintenance and termination
procedures.
(5) Billing and complaint procedures including grantee's address,
telephone number and office hours.
(6) Instructions on how to use the cable service and any
converters.
B. A grantee shall notify subscribers and the grantor no less than 30
days in advance of any changes in rates, programming services, or
channel positions, provided such change is within the control of the
grantee. Grantee shall not be required to provide prior notice to
§ 13-209 FERGUSON CODE § 13-209
FWD:298
subscribers of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory
fee, franchise fee or any other fee, tax, assessment or charge
of any kind imposed by any federal agency, the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania or the grantor on the transaction between the
grantee and the subscriber.
5. Subscriber Billing Practices.
A. As mentioned herein above, grantee shall notify each of its existing
subscribers at least once a year, all new subscribers, and upon
request of a subscriber, of its billing practices in accordance with
FCC rules. Bills shall be clear, concise and understandable. Bills
must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited
to, basic service and premium tier service charges, if applicable,
equipment charges and any installation or repair charges. Bills
shall state the billing period, including an effective due date, the
amount of current billing and any relevant credits or past due
balances. Grantee shall not assess late fees for non-payment of a
current bill until at least 30 days have elapsed since the mailing of
the bill by grantee.
B. As mentioned herein above, subscribers shall be notified of any
changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as
soon as possible through announcements on the cable system and/
or in writing. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of 30
days in advance of such changes if the changes is within the
grantee's control.
C. The subscriber bill shall contain the following information
presented in plain language and format:
(1) Name and address of grantee.
(2) The period of time over which each chargeable service is billed
including prorated periods as a result of the establishment and
termination of service.
(3) A fully itemized list of charges levied for programming
services, equipment provided, and other services or items
offered, and a report of all activity during the billing period,
including optional charges, rebates and credits.
(4) The amount of the bill for the current billing period, separate
from any balance.
(5) A grantee's telephone number and a statement that the
subscriber may call this number with any questions about the
bill.
(6) The date on which payment is due from the subscriber.
D. The account of a subscriber shall not be considered delinquent
until at least 30 days have elapsed from the due date of the bill,
§ 13-209 FOREWORD § 13-209
FWD:299
which shall be a date certain. The following provisions shall apply
to the imposition of late charges on subscribers:
(1) A grantee shall not impose a late charge on a subscriber unless
a subscriber is delinquent, and grantee has given the
subscriber written notice of the delinquency.
(2) A late charge of reasonable amount may be imposed monthly.
(3) No late charge may be assessed on the amount of a bill in
dispute if found in favor of the subscriber.

the costs incurred by a grantee in processing such checks.
E. In case of a billing dispute, a grantee shall respond to a written
complaint from a subscriber within 30 days. Refund checks shall be
issued promptly, but no later than either the customer's next billing
cycle following resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is
earlier, or the return of the equipment supplied by the cable
operator if service is terminated. Credits for service shall be issued
no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the
determination that a credit is warranted.
6. Mobility-Limited Subscribers. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise
agreement, upon the request of mobility-limited subscribers, a grantee
shall make a good faith effort to arrange for delivery, pickup or
exchange or replacement of converters or other equipment at the
subscriber's address or by the use of a satisfactory equivalent means
such as provision of a pre-paid postage mailer.
7. Dispute Resolution.
A. Every grantee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting
upon, and resolving customer complaints, and crediting customer
accounts, without intervention by the grantor.
B. The grantee's complaint procedure shall be filed with the grantor
prior to its acceptance of a new or renewed franchise.
C. The grantee's investigation of a subscriber complaint shall be
concluded in no more than 30 days after receiving a written
complaint, at which time the grantee shall notify the subscriber of
the results of its investigation and its proposed action or credit.
D. In the event of a billing dispute, grantee shall notify the subscriber
in full accordance with FCC customer service regulations
regarding billing and complaint procedures and provide the
address and telephone number of grantor's cable office.
8. Scrambling of Cable Channels. In accordance with §§ 640 and 641 of
the Cable Act, grantee shall fully scramble or block the audio and video
§ 13-209 FERGUSON CODE § 13-209
FWD:300
§ 13-210. General Financial and Insurance Provisions. [Ord. 907, 8/
18/2008, § 10]
programming of a channel upon request by a cable service subscriber
without charge.
9. Programming.
A. Programming Decisions. All programming decisions shall be at the
sole discretion of grantee; provided, however, that the grantor shall
be notified of any changes in rates, channel positions or
programming service as required by FCC customer service
regulations.
1. Payment to Grantor.
A. As compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this Part, a
grantee for a cable system located in the rights-of-way, unless
negotiated in a franchise agreement, shall have the following
obligations:
(1) Application Fee for Initial Franchise. In addition to all other
fees, permits or charges required by the grantor, an applicant
for an initial franchise shall pay to grantor at the time of
application, or amendment to its application, $1,000 as a
deposit on the application fee. An applicant will be assessed an
additional application fee at the end of the review process
should the grantor's actual costs of reviewing the application
exceed the deposit. This fee will be equal to 100% of grantor's
costs (including administration overhead, legal, consulting,
etc.) for administrating the application and granting a
franchise. Any unused portion of the deposit shall be returned
to the applicant.
(2) Franchise Fees. Any grantee subject to the terms of this Part
and a franchise agreement shall, in addition to any other fees,
permits, or charges by grantor, commence making payment of
franchise fees on the effective date of a cable services
franchise agreement or if such grantee is already providing
cable services over the cable system, on the date of the
passage of this Part. Commencing on the specified date, a
grantee subject to the terms of this Part, shall pay to grantor
an amount equal to 5% of its gross revenues for the provision
of cable services as defined in this Part and generally in the
form as illustrated in Exhibit A, attached and made part of this
Part by reference.
B. Payments due the grantor under this provision shall be computed
at the end of each calendar year quarter. Payments shall be due and
payable for each quarter not later than 45 days from the last day of
the three-month period. Specifically, payments shall be due and
§ 13-209 FOREWORD § 13-210
FWD:301
payable on or before May 15 (for the first quarter), August 15
(for the second quarter), November 15 (for the third quarter),
and February 15 for the fourth quarter). Each payment shall be
accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the
computation and such other relevant facts related to the payment
of the franchise fee as may be required by the grantor. At request
of grantor, and if agreed to by grantee, payments will be made
electronically.
C. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that
the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such
acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the
grantor may have for further or additional sums payable under the
provisions of this franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to
audit and re-computation by the grantor.
D. In the event any payment is not made on the due date, interest on
the amount due shall accrue from such date at the annual rate of
6%.
E. If a grantee offers bundled, tied, or combined cable services (which
are subject to the franchise fee) with non-cable services (which are
not subject to the franchise fee) to individual subscribers, the
combined revenues from such bundled services shall be allocated
consistent with the rates or prices advertised by the grantee
through its marketing materials or on its published rate card.
If the grantee does not advertise or publish separate prices for the
combined services, the percentage that the price for the combined
services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the
individual services shall be pro-rated across all the services in the
bundled package.
As an example, a grantee may offer a "bundle" of video, data, and
voice services for a flat fee of $75 where the retail rate for the
services purchased on an individual basis would equal $100. The
grantee would apply a 25% discount to the revenue derived from
each service. Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the
bundle were $50, grantee would recognize cable service revenue
in the amount of $37.50 and pay a franchise fee on that revenue.
In no event shall grantee be permitted to evade or reduce
applicable franchise fee payments required to be made to grantor
due to discounted bundled services.
2. Application of Franchise Fees and Other Fees and Charges.
A. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the franchise fees payable
by grantee to grantor shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a
tax, and shall be in addition to any and all taxes of general
applicability and other generally applicable fees and charges which
grantee may be required to pay to grantor and/or to any other
§ 13-210 FERGUSON CODE § 13-210
FWD:302
governmental authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct
obligations of grantee.
B. Grantee shall not deduct all or any part of the franchise fees or
other payments or in-kind contributions to be made by grantee to
grantor pursuant to this Part and/or a franchise from the franchise
fees paid thereunder unless specifically agreed to in a franchise
agreement.
3. Performance Bond.
A. Except as may be described in a franchise, at the time a franchise is
accepted, a grantee shall furnish and file with the grantor a
performance bond. The performance bond shall run to the grantor
in the sum of as then determined in the franchise agreement. The
performance bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful
performance of grantee of all terms and conditions of this Part and
a franchise. The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the
performance bond or other security are in addition to all other
rights the grantor may have under a franchise or any other
applicable law. The company providing such performance bond
must be licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
B. The rights reserved by the grantor with respect to the performance
bond are in addition to all other rights the grantor may have under
a franchise or other applicable law.
C. The performance bond shall be subject to the approval of the
grantor.
4. Security Fund.
A. Except as otherwise described in a franchise, at the time a
franchise is accepted, and, in lieu of a performance bond as
required herein above, a grantee shall deposit into a bank account,
established by the grantor, and maintain on deposit through the
term of this franchise, the sum of $10,000, unless otherwise
provided in a franchise agreement, as a common security fund for
the faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this Part, the
franchise and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of
the grantor and the payment by a grantee of any claim, liens, costs,
expenses and taxes due the grantor which arise by reason of the
construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system.
Interest on this deposit shall be paid to grantee by the bank on an
annual basis.
B. Provision shall be made to permit the grantor to withdraw funds
from the security fund. Grantee shall not use the security fund for
other purposes and shall not assign, pledge or otherwise use this
security fund as security for any purpose. The grantor reserves the
right to increase the required amount of the security fund to match
§ 13-210 FOREWORD § 13-210
FWD:303
changes in the consumer price index for all items and all urban
consumers.
C. If a grantee fails to pay to the grantor any amounts due and unpaid
to grantor; or fails to pay to the grantor any liquidated damages,
costs or expenses which the grantor shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of a grantee in connection with this
Part and a franchise, the grantor may then withdraw such funds
from the security fund. Payments are not franchise fees as required
in Subsection 1, or as otherwise described in a franchise
agreement.
5. Procedure for Imposition of Penalties.
A. If the grantor is able to demonstrate that grantee violated any
provision of this Part or franchise agreement, it shall promptly
notify grantee in writing of the nature of such violation and the
section of this Part or franchise agreement that it believes has been
violated. If the grantor does not notify grantee of any violation of
this Part or franchise agreement, it shall not operate as a waiver of
any rights of the grantor hereunder or pursuant to applicable law.
B. Grantee shall have 45 days to cure such violation after written
notice is received by taking appropriate steps to comply with the
terms of this Part or franchise agreement. If the nature of the
violation is such that, in the grantor's reasonable judgment, it
cannot be fully cured within 45 days due to circumstances outside
of grantee's control, the period of time in which grantee must cure
the violation may be extended by the grantor in writing for such
additional time necessary to complete the cure, provided that
grantee shall have promptly commenced to cure and is diligently
pursuing its efforts to cure in the reasonable judgment of the
grantor.
C. If the violation has not been cured within the time allowed under
Subsection 5B of this section, then grantee shall be liable for
liquidated damages in accordance with Subsection 6 of this section.
6. Liquidated Damages and Opportunity to Cure.
A. Because grantee's failure to comply with provisions of this Part or
franchise agreement may result in harm to the grantor and because
it will be difficult to measure the extent of such harm, the grantor
may assess liquidated damages against grantee in the following
amounts provided grantee has had an opportunity to cure in
accordance with Subsection 5B of this section. Such damages shall
not be a substitute for specific performance by grantee, but shall be
in addition to such performance.
B. The first day for which liquidated damages may be assessed, if
there has been no cure after the end of the applicable cure period,
shall be the day after the end of the applicable cure period,
§ 13-210 FERGUSON CODE § 13-210
FWD:304
including any extension of the cure period granted by the grantor.
Liquidated damages may not be assessed for a time period
exceeding 120 days, after which the grantor may initiate an action
in law or equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.
C. The grantor may assess liquidated damages against grantee in the
following amounts provided grantee has had an opportunity to cure
in accordance with Subsection 5B of this section:
(1) For failure to provide and maintain cable service as required,
$200 per day for each day the violation continues.
(2) For failure to obtain and maintain permits as required, $200
per day for each day the violation continues.
(3) For failure to give notices required in this Part or franchise to
grantor as required, $200 per day for each day the violation
continues.
(4) For failure to comply with any customer service provisions as
required, $200 per day for each day the violation continues.
(5) For failure to submit reports in a timely fashion as required,
$150 per day for each day the violation continues.
(6) For failure to comply with any material provision of the
franchise, $150 per day for each day the violation continues.
7. Liability Insurance.
A. A grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of a franchise
agreement and as may be further described therein, liability
insurance with a company licensed to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with a rating by A.M. Best of not
less than "A-minus VII," insuring grantee and the grantor with
regard to all damages mentioned in paragraph .A of Subsection 6 of
this section, in the minimum amounts of:
(1) One million dollars for bodily injury or death to any one person.
(2) One million dollars for bodily injury or death resulting from any
one accident.
(3) Two million dollars for all other types of liability in umbrella
form.
B. At the time of acceptance of a franchise, and upon request, grantee
shall furnish to the grantor a certificate evidencing that a
satisfactory insurance policy has been obtained. Said certificate
shall be approved by the grantor and such insurance policy shall
require that the grantor be notified 30 days prior to any expiration
or cancellation.
§ 13-210 FOREWORD § 13-210
FWD:305
C. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
contain the following or similar endorsement:
"Should any of the policies described herein be canceled before
the expiration date thereof, the insurer affording coverage will
endeavor to mail 30 days' written notice to the certificate holder
named herein, but failure to mail such notice shall impose no
obligation or liability of any kind upon the insurer affording
coverage, its agents, or representatives, or the insurer of this
certificate."
D. A grantee will replace such insurance to conform to this Part by
promptly filing evidence of proof of insurance with grantor before
termination of any existing insurance.
8. Grantor's Right to Revoke. In addition to all other rights which the
grantor has pursuant to law or equity, the grantor reserves the right to
initiate revocation proceedings, and all rights and privileges pertaining
thereto, in the event that:
A. It is demonstrated that grantee substantially and materially
violated any material provision of this franchise or state, federal or
local law applicable to grantee's operation of a cable system within
grantor.
B. It is demonstrated that grantee repeatedly violates, after notice
and opportunity to cure, any of the material provisions of the
franchise or provision of valid applicable state, federal or local law
and refuses to cure it.
C. A grantee is found to have practiced any fraud or deceit upon the
grantor or subscriber.
D. A grantee is found to have knowingly misrepresented a material
fact in the application for, negotiation of, renegotiation of, or
renewal of the franchise.
9. Revocation Procedures. In the event that the grantor determines that a
grantee has violated any material event as set forth in Subsection 8 of
this section, or any generally applicable material federal, state or local
law, the grantor may make a written demand on a grantee that it
remedy such violation and that continued violation may be cause for
revocation. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not
remedied to the satisfaction of the grantor within 45 days following
such demand, the grantor shall determine whether or not such
violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect by grantee is due to acts of
God or other causes which result from circumstances beyond grantee's
control.
A. The grantor may schedule a public hearing and grantee shall be
provided with an opportunity to be heard. This opportunity shall
include the ability to introduce evidence, to question witnesses and
§ 13-210 FERGUSON CODE § 13-210
FWD:306
to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate in accordance
with the standards of a fair hearing applicable to administrative
hearings in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The causes for
pending revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such
cause shall be recited in a notice to a grantee prior to the public
hearing. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that need
to be shown by the grantor to support a revocation. All notice
requirements shall be met by providing grantee at least 45 days'
prior written notice (via certified mail - return receipt requested)
of any public hearing concerning the proposed revocation of a
franchise.
B. If notice is given and after a public hearing is held, the grantor
determines there is a violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect
by a grantee, the grantor shall state in writing the grounds for its
decision and give notice to a grantee to correct or remedy the same
within such reasonable additional time, in such manner and upon
such reasonable terms and conditions as grantor may direct.
C. If after a public hearing or hearing by a hearing officer, designated
by grantor, it is determined that a grantee's performance of any of
the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of franchise was
prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform
shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall
be imposed as a result thereof, provided grantee has notified
grantor in writing within 30 days of its receipt of notice of the
breach of said cause. Such causes beyond a grantee's reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be
limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor strikes.
D. If, after notice is given and opportunity to cure, at a grantee's
option, a public hearing is held, the grantor determines there was a
violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the grantor may
declare, by formal resolution, a franchise revoked and cancelled
and of no further force and effect unless there is compliance within
such period as grantor may fix, such period not to be less than 30
days provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted for
fraud or misrepresentation.
E. The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the
agenda of the grantor's governing body at the expiration of the
time set by it for compliance. The grantor then may terminate a
franchise forthwith upon finding that a grantee has failed to
achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its
discretion.
F. If the grantor, after notice is given and, at a grantee's option, a full
public proceeding is held and appeal is exhausted, declares a
franchise breached, the parties may pursue their remedies
pursuant to a franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable.

§ 11]
§ 13-212. Removal, Transfer and Purchase. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008,
§ 12]
1. Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the system,
grantee shall notify the grantor of such fact and such notification shall
be treated as a notification that a change in control of grantee has taken
place, and the provisions of this franchise governing the consent to
transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such
transfer or change in ownership occurred.
2. Abandonment. Grantee may not abandon any portion of the cable
system thereof without having first given three months written notice to
the grantor. Grantee may not abandon any portion of the cable system
without compensating the grantor for damages resulting from the
abandonment.
1. Removal after Revocation or Denial of Renewal.
A. Upon denial of renewal of a franchise, or upon its revocation, as
provided for, the grantor shall have the right to require a grantee to
remove within two years, at a grantee's expense, all or any portion
of the cable system from all rights-of-way and public property
within the grantor. In so removing the cable system, a grantee shall
refill and compact at its own expense, any excavation that shall be
made and shall leave all rights-of-way, public property and private
property in as good a condition as that prevailing prior to grantee's
removal of the cable system, and without affecting, altering or
disturbing in any way electric, telephone or utility, cables wires or
attachments. The grantor, or its delegation, shall have the right to
inspect and approve the condition of such rights-of-way and public
property after removal. Under no circumstance including, without
limitation, revocation, or denial of renewal of a franchise or any
other action to forbid or disallow grantee from providing cable
services, shall grantee or its assignees be required to sell any right,
title, interest, use or control of any portion of grantee's facilities
including, without limitation, the cable system and any capacity
used for cable service or otherwise, to the grantor or any third
party. Grantee shall not be required to remove or to relocate the
plant that facilitates Internet access, digital voice, or other such
services not governed by Title VI of the Communications Act of
1934, as amended, or any portion thereof as a result of revocation,
denial of renewal or any other action to forbid or disallow grantee
from providing cable services.
B. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection 1Aof this section, if a
grantee has failed to complete such removal within the time given
under Subsection 1A of this section, after written notice of the
§ 13-211 FERGUSON CODE § 13-212
FWD:308
grantor's demand for removal is given, the grantor shall have the
right to exercise one of the following options:
(1) Declare all right, title and interest to the cable system to be in
the grantor or its delegator with all rights of ownership
including, but not limited to, the right to operate the cable
system or transfer the cable system to another for operation by
it.
(2) Declare the cable system abandoned and cause the cable
system, or such part thereof as the grantor shall designate, to
be removed at no cost to the grantor. The cost of said removal
shall be recoverable from the security fund, indemnity and/or
penalty section provided for in a franchise, or from a grantee
directly.
2. Sale or Transfer of Franchise.
A. A franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred (including
through inheritance), either in whole or in part, used as collateral
for any loan or loans, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall
title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or
property therein, pass to or vest in any person without full
compliance with the procedure set forth in this section.
B. Neither grantee nor its parent nor any affiliated entity shall
transfer, assign or otherwise encumber, through its own action or
by operation of law, its right, title or interest in the cable system or
in a franchise agreement without the prior written consent of the
grantor. Neither grantee nor its parent nor any affiliated entity
shall sell, convey, transfer, exchange or release more than 50% of
its equitable ownership in the cable system without the prior
written consent of the grantor. No such consent shall be required
for (1) a transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by
assignment to a financial institution of any rights, title or interest of
grantee in the franchise or in the cable system in order to secure
indebtedness; or (2) a transfer to an entity owned and/or controlled
by grantee.
(1) The parties to the sale or transfer shall make a written request
to the grantor for its approval of a sale or transfer. The written
request shall not be deemed complete until all information
required by the grantor in accordance with applicable FCC
regulations is provided to the grantor. Upon receipt of a
complete written request with all application information -
including the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the
transferee, the grantor shall have 120 days to grant or deny
such approval. Within 30 days of the request, in accordance
with FCC rules and regulations, notify the grantee in writing of
the additional information, if any, it requires to determine the
§ 13-212 FOREWORD § 13-212
FWD:309
§ 13-213. Rights of Individuals Protected. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008,
§ 13]
legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee or
new controlling party.
(2) The grantor shall reply in writing within 30 days of the request
and shall exercise its determination that a public hearing is
necessary.
(3) If a public hearing is deemed necessary pursuant to
subparagraph (2) above, such hearing shall be commenced
within 30 days of such determination and notice of any such
hearing shall be given 14 days prior to the hearing by
publishing notice thereof. The notice shall contain the date,
time and place of the public hearing and shall briefly state the
substance of the action to be considered by the grantor.
(4) Within 30 days after the closing of the public hearing, the
grantor shall approve or deny in writing the sale or transfer
request. If the grantor has not taken final action on the
grantee's request for consent within 120 days after receiving
such request, consent shall be deemed granted.
(5) Any consent by the grantor for any transfer described above
shall not be effective until the proposed transferee or assignee
shall have executed a legally binding agreement stating that it
shall be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in the
franchise.
3. Purchase by Grantor upon Denial of Renewal or Revocation.
A. Upon lawful denial of renewal or revocation of franchise, the
grantor may, in lawful manner and upon the payment of fair market
value, mutually determined grantor and grantee, lawfully obtain,
purchase, condemn, acquire, take over and hold the cable system.
B. Upon the revocation of a franchise, the grantor may in lawful
manner and upon the payment of an equitable price lawfully obtain,
purchase, and condemn, in accordance with such proceedings
governed by federal and/or state law, take over and hold the cable
system.
1. Unfair Discriminatory Practices Prohibited. In the performance of a
franchise, a grantee shall not discriminate unfairly against any person
on the ground of or because of race, creed, color, national origin or
ancestry, gender, religion or political opinion or affiliation, income of
residents in any area of the grantor, or age. A grantee shall comply at all
times with all other valid applicable federal, state and local laws, and all
federal and state executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.

FWD:310
§ 13-214. Miscellaneous Provisions. [Ord. 907, 8/18/2008, § 14]
2. Subscriber Privacy.
A. Absent a court order or requirement of federal or state law, no
signal of a channel may be transmitted from a subscriber terminal
for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices
without the express written permission of the subscriber; provided,
however, that grantee may conduct system-wide or individually
addressed "sweeps" solely for the purpose of verifying system
integrity, checking for illegal taps, controlling return-path
transmission, billing for pay services or monitoring channel usage
in a manner not inconsistent with the federal law. Grantee shall not
record or retain any information transmitted between a subscriber
and any third party, except as required for lawful business
purposes. The request for such permission shall be contained in a
separate document with a prominent statement that the subscriber
is authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provisions.
Such written permission shall be for a limited period of time not to
exceed one year which shall be renewed at the option of the
subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked for a subscriber's failure to
provide or renew such authorization. The authorization shall be
revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind
whatsoever. Such permission shall be required for each type or
classification of cable communications activity planned for the
purpose of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices.
B. No information or data obtained by monitoring transmission of a
signal from a subscriber terminal, or any other means including,
but not limited to, lists of the names and addresses of such
subscribers or any lists that identify the viewing habits of
subscribers shall be sold or otherwise made available to any party
other than to a grantee and its employees for internal business use,
and also to the subscriber subject of that information, unless a
grantee has received specific written authorization from the
subscriber to make such data available.
C. Compliance with the Cable Act, § 631, shall be deemed compliance
with this Subsection 2 of this section.
1. Compliance with Laws. A grantee and the grantor shall act reasonably
and in good faith, deal fairly, and cooperate with each other to enable
performance of all obligations under this Part and achievements of the
expected benefits. A grantee shall conform to all grantor ordinances,
resolutions, rules and regulations heretofore or hereafter adopted or
established during the entire term of a franchise agreement which
conform with generally applicable grantor ordinances.
2. Continuity of Service Mandatory. Upon revocation or lawful denial of
renewal of a franchise agreement, the grantor may require a grantee to
continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time not
§ 13-213 FOREWORD § 13-214
FWD:311
to exceed six months. A grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in
interest, continue to operate the cable system under the terms and
conditions of a franchise agreement. In the event a grantee does not
so operate the cable system, the grantor may take such steps as it,
in its sole discretion, deems necessary to assure continued service to
subscribers.
3. Work Performed by Others.
A. All provisions of this franchise shall remain the responsibility of a
grantee, and a grantee shall be responsible for and hold the grantor
harmless for any claims or liability arising out of work performed
by persons other than a grantee in accordance with § 13-202,
Subsection 8, of this Part. The grantee shall further provide all
emergency contact information (name, address, phone number,

B. All provisions of this Part and a franchise shall apply to any
subcontractor or others performing any work or services pursuant
to the provisions of a franchise.
4. Compliance with Federal, State and Local Laws.
A. Conflict of Law. If any federal, state or local law or regulation
requires or permits a grantee or the grantor to perform any service
or act or shall prohibit a grantee or the grantor from performing
any service or act which may be in conflict with the terms of a
franchise, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof,
grantor and a grantee may by mutual agreement and in accordance
with such change in law, modify a franchise agreement.
B. Severability. If any term, condition or provision of this Part or a
franchise or the application thereof to any person or circumstance
shall, to any extent, be rendered invalid or unenforceable as in
conflict with any law, rule or regulation of a superior governmental
body, the remainder hereof and the application of such term,
condition or provision to persons or circumstances other than those
as to whom it shall be held invalid or unenforceable shall not be
affected thereby, and this Part and a franchise and all the terms,
provisions and conditions thereof shall, in all other respects,
continue to be effective and to be complied with. In the event that
such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded,
amended or otherwise changed so that the provision which had
been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law,
rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon
return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on a
grantee and the grantor.
C. In the event that any court or other authority of competent
jurisdiction declares any section, provision or clause of this Part
and a franchise to be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, or is
preempted by federal or state laws or regulations, such section,
§ 13-214 FERGUSON CODE § 13-214
FWD:312
provision or clause shall be deemed to be severable from the
remaining portions of this agreement and shall not affect the
legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of this
agreement.
5. Non-enforcement by Grantor. A grantee shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this Part or a
franchise by reason of any failure of the grantor to enforce prompt
compliance.

operation under a franchise.
B. A grantee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable system
subject to the supervision of all the authorities of the grantor who
have jurisdiction in such matters and in strict compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations
affecting the cable system.
C. Upon reasonable written notice and in accordance with the
applicable provisions contained in § 13-205, Subsection 8, of this
Part and a franchise, a cable system and all parts thereof shall be
subject to the right of periodic inspection by the grantor provided
that such inspection shall not interfere with the operation of the
cable system and such inspections take place during normal
business hours with a representative of the grantee present.
7. Miscellaneous Violations.
A. Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, from and after the
acceptance of the franchise, it shall be unlawful for any person to
establish, operate or to carry on the business of distributing to any
persons in the grantor any video signals or audio signals by means
of a cable system using rights-of-way unless a franchise therefore
has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Part, and
unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
B. Unless permitted by law, from and after the acceptance of a
franchise, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or
maintain within any rights-of-way in the grantor, or within any
other public property of the grantor, or within any privately owned
area within the grantor which has not yet become a rights-of-way
but is designated or delineated as a proposed rights-of-way on any
tentative subdivision map approved by the grantor, or the grantor's
official map or the grantor's major thoroughfare plan, any cable
system, unless a franchise authorizing such use of such rights-ofway
or property or areas has first been obtained.

FWD:313
8. Emergency Use. The grantee shall comply with the emergency alert
provisions set forth by the FCC, set forth under 47 CFR Part 11, FCC
rules and regulations, Emergency Alert System (EAS). To the extent
required by federal and state law, grantee shall assist the grantor in
working with the Centre County Office of Emergency Services and the
Centre Region Emergency Management Council in the establishment of
an emergency response plan.
9. Controlling Law. This Part and a franchise shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania except to the extent the Supremacy Clause of the
United States Constitution requires application of federal law.
10. Captions. The paragraph captions and headings in a franchise are for
convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning of interpretation of a franchise.
11. Calculation of Time. Where the performance or doing of any act, duty,
matter, payment or thing is required hereunder and the period of time
or duration for the performance or during thereof is prescribed and
fixed herein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and
include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period or duration of time.
When the last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday or a legal
holiday, that day shall be omitted from the computation.
12. Court Jurisdiction. Except as may be permitted by applicable court
rules, any proceedings relating to this Part or a franchise granted
pursuant to it will be venued in the courts of Centre County,
Pennsylvania.
13. Force Majeure. The grantee shall not be held in default under, or in
noncompliance with, the provisions of this Part or franchise, nor suffer
any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default
(including termination, cancellation or revocation of the franchise),
where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused
by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain
or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature,
labor disputes, failure of utility service necessary to operate the cable
system, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or
other event that is reasonably beyond the grantee's ability to anticipate
or control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for
utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which
the grantee's cable or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of
materials or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.
14. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Part or the grantee's
franchise agreement is or was intended to confer third-party
beneficiary status on any member of the public to enforce the terms of
this Part or the franchise agreement.

§ 15-409. Residential Permit Parking. [Ord. 374, 1/10/1989; as
amended by Ord. 751, 4/3/2000, § 3; by Ord. 780, 9/17/2001, § 4; by
Ord. 851, 5/16/2005, §§ 3, 4; by Ord. 922, 4/6/2009, § 3; and by Ord.
971, 8/20/2012, § 2]
1. Findings and Purpose. The Township of Ferguson finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Township of Ferguson are subjected
to commuter vehicle parking, therefore depriving the residents of
those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles.
B. Those residential streets with a high degree of commuter traffic
also suffer a reduction in the quality of neighborhood life due to
increased ambient noise level, air pollution, and traffic congestion.
C. The establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected
areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for
parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the
week. Therefore, the Township of Ferguson considers it to be in the
interest of the people of the Township of Ferguson to provide for
the establishment of a residential permit parking program to insure
primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood
residents and businesses and also to provide a quieter and cleaner
air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed in
this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE  A motor vehicle parked in a residential area
by a person not a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR  A person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this section, a proprietor shall be entitled to no
more than two parking permits for that business or professional office
address, unless extenuating circumstances exist as determined by the
Chief of Police, and the total number of permits issued do not exceed
§ 15-408 FOREWORD § 15-409
FWD:389
the available number of spaces for all residents of the street block on
which the main entry door of the business faces.
RESIDENT  A person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA  A contiguous area containing public highways
or parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and non-business property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in Subsection 4 of this
section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, for multiple day
periods as determined by the Township, the number of vehicles
parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area is
equal to 70% or more of the legal, on-street parking capacity of the
area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking space shall
be 20 linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in Subsection 3A, directly
above, 10% or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not owned and/or driven by a resident or
proprietor of that residential area. [Amended by Ord. No. 1052,
2/18/2020]
C. Special Requests. Property owners may ask the Board of
Supervisors to designate certain streets as residential permit
parking areas. [Added by Ord. No. 1052, 2/18/2020]
D. In determining that a specific area identified as impacted and
eligible for residential permit parking designation, the following
factors are taken into consideration: [Added by Ord. No. 1052, 2/
18/2020]
(1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and
environment.
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the
Township of Ferguson.
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking
and related health and safety hazards.
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential permit
parking and their willingness to bear the administrative costs
in connection with it.
§ 15-409 FERGUSON CODE § 15-409
FWD:390
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public
for religious, health or educational purposes.

be made to the Chief of Police by the person desiring the permit, who
shall reside on, or be a proprietor of, property immediately adjacent to a
street or other location within a residential parking permit area. A
separate application shall be required for each motor vehicle at each
address, and each application shall be accompanied by the permit fee
as set by resolution of the Board of Supervisors, which shall be for the
use of the Township of Ferguson to be applied to the cost of
administering the residential permit parking program. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner and the
driver of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the
proprietor, as the case may be; the make, model and registration
number of the motor vehicle; the driver number as taken from the
applicant's current driver's license, and any other reasonable
information deemed necessary by the Township to issue and control

FWD:391
required, at the time of making application, the vehicle registration
card, and proof of residency and/or proprietorship.
6. Issuance of Permits. Permits will be issued based on the availability of

maximum of four per parcel.
D. Rushcliffe Street: up to two permits per leased/rental residence.

more permits than available spaces, each will be reduced by one
permit in reverse listing order on the next renewal date until the
number of permits does not exceed the number of available spaces.
Should more spaces exist than permits, the above numbers may be
increased for owner occupied residences first and businesses
secondly.
Upon receipt of the application and the permit fee, and
determination that the information upon the application shows
that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the
Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking
permit, which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year
in which the permit was issued. The permit shall be renewable
annually before the expiration date, upon making application for
renewal and payment of the permit fee. Any consecutive renewal
permit fee shall be waived for owner occupied residences after the
first year of payment. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this
section for any person to display other than the current and valid
permit while standing or parking in a residential permit parking
area at any time when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Permits. Temporary parking permits
(up to 30 days) may be issued by the Chief of Police to bona fide visitors
of residents of a designated residential permit parking area.
8. Responsibility of Permit Holder.

holder of a residential parking permit shall be permitted to stand or
park a motor vehicle operated by him in any designated residential
parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential
parking permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be

or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit
exempt its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking
regulation other than residential permit parking regulation or
restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the
permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than
the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the
parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person falsely to
represent himself as eligible for a residential parking permit or to
furnish false information in an application to the Chief of Police in
order to obtain a residential parking permit.
9. Revocation of Permits. The Chief of Police shall have authority to revoke
the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in
violation of any provision of this section. Upon written notification to
him of the revocation, the permit holder shall surrender the permit to
the Chief of Police. Failure to do so, when so requested, shall constitute
a violation of this section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice
may, within 10 days after the date of the notice, appeal to Board of
Supervisors for a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of Board

municipality, construction of the permitted repair or replacement shall
commence. Within 60 days of the original notification by the
municipality, the construction shall be completed unless seasonal or
unique conditions mandate a longer period, in which case the
municipality or its authorized agent shall set an extended completion
date.
4. The municipality's certified SEO shall have the authority to require the
repair of any malfunction by the following methods: cleaning, repair or
replacement of components of the existing system, adding capacity or
otherwise altering or replacing the system's treatment tank, expanding
the existing disposal area, replacing the existing disposal area,
replacing a gravity distribution system with a pressurized system or
other alternatives as appropriate for the specified site.
5. In lieu of, or in combination with, the remedies described in Subsection
4 above, the municipal SEO may require the installation of water
conservation equipment and the institution of water conservation
practices in structures served. Water using devices and appliances in
the structure may be required to be retrofitted with water saving
appurtenances or they may be required to be replaced by water
conserving devices and appliances. Wastewater generation in the
structure may also be reduced by requiring changes in water usage
patterns in the structure served.
6. In the event that the rehabilitation measures in Subsections 1 through 5
are not feasible or do not prove effective, the municipality may require
the owner to apply to the DEP for a permit to install a single residence
treatment and discharge system. Upon receipt of said permit the owner
shall complete construction of the system within 60 days.
7. Should none of the remedies described above prove totally effective in
eliminating the malfunction of an existing disposal system, the property
owner is not absolved of responsibility for that malfunction. The
municipality may require whatever action is necessary to lessen or
mitigate the malfunction to the extent that it feels necessary.

NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS
§ 21-501. Legislative Findings. [Ord. 961, 12/12/2011, § 1]
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has adopted enabling legislation,
specifically the Neighborhood Improvement District Act, 73 P.S. § 831, Act
No. 2000-130, authorizing the creation of neighborhood improvement
districts to enable property owners in neighborhoods to make
improvements within the neighborhood or to provide services to their
neighborhoods that supplement municipal services otherwise provided. The
legislation provides for the assessment of property owners within the
neighborhood improvement district (NID) to pay for the improvements
or additional services. The Board of Supervisors may create an NID, by
ordinance pursuant to Act No. 2000-130, when the Board believes that
such a district is necessary and desirable to improve the quality of life for
residents and commercial occupants within an improvement district.
§ 21-502. Establishment of the Homestead Farms Neighborhood
Improvement District. [Ord. 961, 12/12/2011, § 1]

Improvement District Act of 2000 (Act), the Homestead Farms
Neighborhood Improvement District (NID) is established with
boundaries depicted on Exhibit 1, appended to this Part, generally
encompassing the residential properties within Ferguson Township
with driveway access onto Crandall Drive. A companion NID will also be
established in the Patton Township portion of Homestead Farms.
2. District Plan and Improvements. Special assessment revenues shall be
used solely for administrative services and roadway improvements as
detailed in the "Final Plan for Establishing Neighborhood Improvement
Districts for Homestead Farms in Ferguson Township and Patton
Township" on file with the Township Secretary and not for essential
governmental services provided by Patton Township or Ferguson
Township.
3. Levy of Special Assessment. There is hereby levied an assessment to
pay the cost of the improvements computed as follows:
A. Amount of Assessment. The total assessment for the combined
Patton Township and Ferguson Township shall be based on the total
proposed project costs of $212,245.
B. Method of Assessment. The special assessment fees on each
property shall be based on the total proposed project costs divided
evenly among each of the 48 properties, comprised of 43 properties
in Patton Township and five properties in Ferguson Township. The
§ 21-501 FOREWORD § 21-502
FWD:555
special assessment fees on each property shall be $4,421.77 [ =
($212,245/48)].
C. Payment of Assessment.
(1) On behalf of the property owners the Homestead Farms
Corporation shall provide an initial installment payment of
$30,000 to the NID in January 2012 as a credit of $625 for each
property against the special assessment fee. Said payment
shall be paid to Patton Township.
(2) The remainder of the special assessment ($4,421.77 less the
initial installment payment of $625) shall be payable in 12
annual installments. Annual installment payments shall be due
on March 1 of each year from 2012 through 2023. The annual
installment payment of the special assessment fee on each
property is $316.40 [ = ($4,421.77-$625)/12].
(3) A 10% penalty shall be applied to payments made after March
1.
(4) Any outstanding balance of the special assessment may be
satisfied at anytime without penalty.
D. Liens. Assessments shall constitute liens and encumbrances upon
the assessed property and shall be collectable in accordance with
the provisions of § 7(d) of Act 130, 73 P.S. § 837(d) and in general
may be collected in the same manner as municipal tax claims
notwithstanding the provision of this section as to installment
payments.
4. Collection of Assessment. Ferguson Township hereby assigns the
collection of the annual assessment to Patton Township. The
assessment shall be collected by the Patton Township Treasurer. The
Treasurer shall mail initial notices to owners of the benefitted
properties no later than January 15 of each installment year. The
Treasurer shall mail delinquent notices in a manner consistent with
Township practices for collection of delinquent tax and assessment
accounts.
5. Management. The Homestead Farms Corporation (HFC), a nonprofit
corporation, shall be the NID management association (NIDMA) for
both NIDs. As provided for in the agreement between the Patton
Township Board of Supervisors (PTBoS), the Ferguson Township Board
of Supervisors (FTBoS) and the HFC, the NIDMA shall meet annually
with a designated representative of the Townships to review the project
implementation. The Public Works Department of Patton Township shall
administer the projects and shall utilize Patton Township resources or
qualified contractors to complete projects as scheduled in the plan.
Contracts shall be awarded by Patton Township to the lowest
responsive bidder. Projects may be included in contracts that also
include work outside the NIDs (i.e., annual street overlay contracts).

owned, off-site easements that shall be approved by others
shall be secured by the applicant prior to the filing for final
plan approval.
(2) If the plan is not approved, the decision shall specify the
defects found in the plan and describe the requirements which
have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the provisions of
this chapter from which such defects or requirements
originate.
D. Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the plan in terms as
presented unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation of communication of the decision, in which case
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
1. A plan shall be officially submitted to the Township Department of
Planning and Zoning for final Township review after all improvements,
as defined by this chapter, indicated on the plan receiving preliminary
approval have been installed or, in lieu of the completion of the
improvements, after deposit with the Township of a corporate bond or
other security acceptable to the Board of Supervisors in accordance
with this chapter. All plans which have received preliminary approval
shall be entitled to final approval in accordance with the terms of the
approved preliminary application for a period of five years from the
date of the preliminary approval.
2. All applications for final approval of a plan shall be acted upon by the
Township within such time limits as established in this chapter,
provided that the Board of Supervisors shall render its decision and
communicate it to the applicant not later than 90 days after the date of
the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission following the date

meeting occur more than 30 days following the filing of the application
or the final order of the court, the said ninety-day period shall be
measured from the 30th day following the day the application was filed.
The plan shall conform to that which received preliminary approval by

Township Solicitor; Centre Regional Planning Agency; Centre
Regional Planning Commission; Centre County Planning
Commission; the Township Engineer; the Township Tree
Commission; Township Arborist; and the Alpha Fire Company
Chief.
B. The final review of the plan shall be conducted by the Board of
Supervisors in the same manner as prescribed for preliminary
review of the plan specified in § 22-303, Subsection 6, except that
final review shall be limited to determining if a) the plan conforms
to the plan which received preliminary approval, including all
requirements and modifications granted by the Board of
Supervisors and b) the requirements for final plan review have
been met.
C. As a component of approval, the applicant shall permit the
Township Engineer to make periodic site inspections of such nature
and extent as is necessary to ensure that the required
improvements are being installed and constructed in conformity
with the design standards contained herein or otherwise specified
in the preliminary approval of the plan. If the applicant has
completed all of the required improvements, the applicant shall
notify the Board of Supervisors, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the improvements and shall
send a copy thereof to the Township. The Board of Supervisors
hereby directs and authorizes the Township Engineer to make a
final inspection of all the aforesaid improvements after receipt of
such notice. The Township Staff shall file a written report with the
Board of Supervisors and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to
the applicant by certified or registered mail. The report shall be
made and mailed within 30 days after receipt. The report shall be
§ 22-304 FOREWORD § 22-304
FWD:583
detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said
improvement, either in whole or in part, and if the improvements
or any portion thereof shall not be approved or shall be rejected by
the Township, the report shall contain a statement of the reasons
for such nonapproval or rejection. For subdivisions and land
developments served by off-site sewer and water service, Township
staff shall coordinate said review with that of the appropriate
authorities and/or companies providing such service to ensure that
the provisions of this chapter are met.
(1) The Township staff shall notify the applicant, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of action taken with relation to the
improvements.
(2) If the Township fails to comply with the time limitation
provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed
to have been approved and the applicant shall be released from
all liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other
security agreement.
(3) If the Township shall not approve or shall reject any portion of
the said improvements, the applicant shall proceed to complete
the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
4. Corporate Bonds and Maintenance Guarantees.
A. In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a
condition for final approval of the plan, the Board of Supervisors
shall require deposit of a corporate bond or other form of financial
security, prior to approval of the plan, in an amount sufficient to
cover the costs of any improvements which may be required. Such
financial security may include, among others, a lending institution
letter of credit or a restrictive or escrow account in a lending
institution. Such bond, or other security, shall provide for, and
secure to the public, the completion of any improvements which
may be required within a stated period which shall not be longer
than five years from the date the plan received preliminary
approval. The amount of financial security to be posted for the
completion of the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of
the cost of completion of the improvements to be estimated as of 90
days following the date scheduled for completion. The basis for
determination of cost of the improvements shall take into account
and be based upon the estimated costs as would be experienced by
the Township if it were to bid and complete the project subject to
the restrictions of the Home Rule Charter, any prevailing wage
requirements or other material and labor requirements on the
Township. Each year, the Board of Supervisors may adjust the
amount of financial security required by comparing the actual costs
of improvements which have been completed and the estimated
costs for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
§ 22-304 FERGUSON CODE § 22-304
FWD:584
expiration of 90 days after either the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to
such adjustment, the Board of Supervisors may require the
applicant to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals 110%. Any additional securities shall be
posted by the applicant in accordance with the Municipalities
Planning Code39 and this Part 3. In determining the adjustment
annually, the Board of Supervisors shall take into account the
restrictions contained above. The amount of financial security
required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of completion
of the required improvements submitted by the applicant and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost.
B. Upon final approval of the plan, if requested by the applicant and in
order to facilitate financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish
the applicant with a signed copy of a resolution indicating final
approval of the plan contingent upon the applicant obtaining
satisfactory financial security. The final plan shall not be signed nor
recorded until the appropriate financial security is supplied to the
Township. In such case, the motion passing the final approval of the
plan shall be contingent upon receipt of satisfactory financial
security within 90 days of the date of the motion (unless a written
extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors). In the event that
satisfactory financial security is not provided within the said 90
days or within the time granted by written extension by the Board
of Supervisors, then the motion granting the contingent approval
shall expire and shall be deemed to be revoked, and the
contingency of the motion granting final approval of the plan shall
be deemed to be not satisfied.
C. Upon written application signed by the obligor and surety of a
performance guarantee in a form approved by the Board of
Supervisors, the governing body may at their discretion extend said
period, provided that satisfactory security for the completion of the
improvements within the extended time is provided, or when the
improvements have been partially completed reduce proportionally
the amount of the bond or other form of security by formal
resolution.
D. In the event that any improvements which may have been required
in accordance with the finally approved plan have not been
installed, the Board of Supervisors may enforce any corporate bond
or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If
the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay
the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by the said security, the Board of

security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
applicant, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such security, and not for any other
municipal purpose.

Board of Supervisors contingent upon review and report by the
Township Engineer in accordance with procedures outlined in

improvements in good condition for a period of one year after
completion of construction and installation of all such
improvements.

referred to as "applicant") shall be responsible for placement of a
development review notice sign on the affected property in accordance
with the following regulations:
A. Timing. Within 10 days of submitting a subdivision, land
development, or PRD plan to the Township, the applicant shall
place a development review sign on the property in accordance
with the location requirements below.
B. Location. One sign shall be placed every 1,000 feet, or portion
thereof, along each side of the property which abuts a public rightof-
way. The sign shall be placed near the property line, but not
within the right-of-way. The sign shall be placed so it does not
impede traffic visibility but can be seen by passing motorists and
pedestrians within the public right-of-way.

following information:
(1) Date of development review notice sign installation.
(2) Sketch of development review notice sign placement.

was placed in accordance with Township standards. The plan
will not be placed on the Planning Commission agenda until
proof that the sign has been posted has been received by the
Township.
D. Sign Rental. A development review notice sign, post and anchor
may be rented from the Township for a nonrefundable fee in
accordance with the Township's fee schedule. The applicant also
has the option of having signs made in accordance with the sign
design standards set forth below.
E. Sign Removal. A development review notice sign shall be removed
from the property within seven days of receiving conditional plan
approval from the Board of Supervisors. If a sign is rented from the
Township, an original approved plan with signatures will not be
released until the rental sign, post and anchor are returned to the
Township in good condition. If the sign is supplied by the applicant
or applicant's agent, an original approved plan with signatures will
not be released until the sign is removed from the property as
verified by the Zoning Administrator.
F. Sign Design. The development review sign shall be 30 inches wide,
48 inches high, and shall have the following wording in three- and
four-inch lettering: DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL UNDER REVIEW,
(TOWNSHIP LOGO) FERGUSON TOWNSHIP, CALL 238-4651 (see
attached exhibit for specifications42). The sign shall be made of
aluminum with white reflective sheeting and the lettering and logo
shall be royal blue.

sign is between five and six feet from ground level. The sign may be
mounted on a four-pound lap-splice post with standard anchor or
on a four-inch by four-inch wood post. If using a wood post, the post
must be buried a minimum of 30 inches in the ground. If the area
where a sign must be mounted is a hard surface and a post cannot
be placed in the ground, the applicant or applicant's agent shall
confer with the Township Zoning Administrator to determine a
feasible way to post the sign and meet the intent of this section. The
sign, when mounted, shall not be obstructed by landscaping.

property owners and the general public of a pending right-of-way or
land acquisition by the Township for a public facility, such as a roadway,
bikeway, trail, park or structure. The sign will have the phone number
of the Township so that persons may call to inquire about the status of
the acquisition. With this type of notification, the Township hopes to
involve interested parties and obtain input earlier in the plan review
process.
2. Notice Requirement. Township staff shall be responsible for placement
of a public sign on the affected property in accordance with the
following regulations:
A. Timing. A public sign shall be posted on the affected property a
minimum of seven days prior to the meeting when the Board of
Supervisors will vote on the proposed right-of-way or land
acquisition. The sign shall be posted on the property in accordance
with the location requirements below.
B. Location. One sign shall be posted at the beginning and terminus of
the project area and at appropriate intersecting locations where
the sign will be informative to the general public. The sign shall be
placed so it does not impede traffic visibility, but can be seen by
passing motorists and pedestrians within the public right-of-way.
C. Sign Design. The public sign shall be 30 inches wide, 48 inches
high, and shall have the following wording in three- and four-inch
lettering: TOWNSHIP PROJECT PROPOSED, (TOWNSHIP LOGO)
FERGUSON TOWNSHIP, CALL 238-4651 (see attached exhibit for
specifications43). The sign shall be made of aluminum with white
reflective sheeting and the lettering and logo shall be royal blue.
D. Sign Mounting. The sign shall be mounted so that the bottom of the
sign is between five and six feet from ground level. The sign may be
mounted on a four-pound lap-splice post with standard anchor or
on a four-inch by four-inch wood post. If using a wood post, the post
must be buried a minimum of 30 inches in the ground. The sign,
when mounted, shall not be obstructed by landscaping.
E. Mapping. The Township shall be responsible for keeping an up-todate
map of the right-of-way or land acquisitions under review. This
43.Editor's Note: Said exhibit is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 22-308 FERGUSON CODE § 22-309

DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
§ 22-501. General. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. Design and Improvements. The design and physical improvements to
the property being subdivided shall be provided, constructed, and
installed by the developer as shown on the approved plan in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter. If any provisions of this chapter
are found to be unreasonable and cause undue and unnecessary
hardship as they apply to his proposed subdivision, the Board of
Supervisors may waive or vary the strict terms of such provisions. The
criteria for the Board of Supervisors to apply in determining whether to
waive or vary the strict applications of a provision are the following and
shall be considered in their totality:
A. That there exist special physical circumstances or conditions which
render the strict application of the requirements as undue or
unnecessary hardship.
B. That the hardship created cannot be ameliorated by a reasonable
change in plans.
C. That the unnecessary or undue hardship has not been created by
the applicant.
D. That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
chapter.
E. That the property cannot be reasonably developed without the
waiver or the varying of the strict terms of this chapter.
F. That the waiver or varying of the strict terms of this chapter will
represent the minimum deviation that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulations in issue.
2. Land Requirements.
A. All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots,
streets, public lands or other proposed uses so that remnants and
landlocked areas shall not be created.
B. Reserve strips preventing access to lots, public rights-of-way,
public lands, or adjacent private lands are prohibited.
C. Wherever possible, applicants shall preserve trees, groves,
waterways, scenic points, identified spots of heritage and other
community assets and landmarks.
D. Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out to avoid the
necessity for excessive cut or fill.
§ 22-501 FOREWORD § 22-501
FWD:607
§ 22-502. Streets. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
E. Land which the Board of Supervisors finds to be unsuitable for
subdivision building purposes due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or
topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless
adequate methods are formulated by the applicant and approved by
the Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation of the Municipal
Planning Commission and Engineer, to solve the problems created
by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for
uses that shall not involve such a danger or incorporated into other
suitable lots.
1. Purpose.
A. Objective. The purpose of these provisions is to establish
appropriate standards for the design of streets that will 1) promote
the safety and convenience of vehicular traffic, 2) promote the
safety and convenience of bicycle and pedestrian traffic, 3) protect
the safety of neighborhood residents, 4) minimize the long term
costs for the maintenance and repair of streets, 5) discourage
crime in residential areas, 6) protect the residential qualities of
neighborhoods by limiting traffic volume, traffic speed, noise and
fumes, 7) encourage the efficient use of land, 8) minimize the cost
of street construction and thereby restrain the rise in housing
costs, 9) use vegetation for mitigating heat island effect on streets,
and 10) minimize the construction of impervious surface, thereby
protecting the quantity and quality of the municipality's water
resources.
B. Limitations. These provisions do not include standards for
stormwater management or pedestrian circulation. Refer to
appropriate ordinances for those standards.
2. Jurisdiction. These provisions shall be applicable to the design and
construction of all new streets.
3. Relationship to Other Plans and Ordinances. The location of all streets
shall conform to the Official Map or Comprehensive Plan adopted by the
Township.
4. Functional Classification. Functional classification, the grouping of
streets by the character of service they provide, was developed for
transportation planning purposes. Comprehensive transportation
planning, an integral part of total economic and social development,
uses functional classification as an important planning tool. The
emergence of functional classification as the predominant method of
grouping streets is consistent with the policies contained herein. All or
§ 22-501 FERGUSON CODE § 22-502
FWD:608
new existing public streets shall be classified in accordance with the
following criteria by the Township Engineer:
A. Arterial. Identified as significant in terms of the nature and
composition of travel it serves. Its importance is derived primarily
from service provided to through travel, from service provided to
major circulation movements within the area, and from service
provided to rurally oriented traffic. Identified as streets with trip
length and density suitable for statewide travel. Arterial streets are
those that provide linkage of cities, towns, and other traffic
generators that can attract travel over similarly long distances.
B. Collector. Collector streets provide access to arterial streets from
other collectors or local access streets. A moderate level of mobility
is expected. A collector street often carries local bus traffic and
provides intracommunity continuity, but, ideally, does not penetrate
identifiable neighborhoods. In the Central Business District, and in
other areas of similar development and traffic density, the collector
system may include the entire street grid.
C. Local. Local streets provide access to abutting properties and may
also conduct traffic from local streets that intersect it. Each local
street shall be designed so that no section of it will convey a traffic
volume greater than 1,000 ADT. Each half of a loop local street may
be regarded as a single local street and the total traffic volume
conveyed on a loop street shall not exceed 1,000 ADT. Local streets
shall be designed to exclude external through traffic which has
neither origin nor destination on the local access.
D. Very Low Volume Local (VLV). Very low volume local (VLV) streets
are similar to local streets except that the maximum traffic volume
on a VLV local street shall be 400 ADT.
5. Design Standards for Streets.
A. All streets shall be designed in accordance with the following,
except where standards contained within this Part 5 differ:
(1) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,
American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials, latest edition.
(2) Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual
Part 2, Highway Design, Publication 13, latest edition.
(3) Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board,
National Research Council, latest edition.
(4) Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers, latest
edition.
(5) Chapter 21, Streets and Sidewalks.
§ 22-502 FOREWORD § 22-502
FWD:609
(6) Chapter 25, Trees.
B. Street Connectivity Index.
(1) All street networks shall be designed to provide a minimum
connectivity index (CI) of 0.75 that is calculated as follows:
(2) CI equals the number of intersections divided by the number of
intersections plus the number of culs-de-sac.
(3) All development proposals shall be designed to provide at least
two access locations to existing streets.
(4) Where a development proposal includes the construction of an
arterial or collector street, those streets shall be completed
prior to the remainder of the street network within the
development.
C. Design Standards for Very Low Volume (VLV) Local Street.
(1) Cartway Width and Curbing. Cartway width and curb
requirements shall be determined on the basis of the intensity
of development proposed and the manner in which parking
shall be as required by Chapter 21, Streets and Sidewalks.
(2) Moving Lanes. All VLV local streets shall provide at least two
lanes.
(3) Engineering Criteria. All features of the geometric design of
residential access streets that are not specified below shall
meet a design speed of 25 miles per hour:
(a) Minimum grade: 1% (Maximum K = 167 for sag positive
drainage).
(b) Maximum grade: 10%.
(c) Horizontal curvature: minimum center-line radius of 100
feet.
(d) Minimum tangent length between reverse curves: 50 feet.
(e) Stopping sight distances: 155 feet minimum (minimum K =
12 for crest and 26 for sag).
(f) Maximum grade within 50 feet of intersection: 5%.
(g) Minimum street length: 250 linear feet.
(4) Cul-De-Sac Turnarounds. A cul-de-sac with a grass center
island with the following dimensions, island radius = 32 feet,
cartway width = 26 feet, cartway radius = 58 feet, right-of-way
radius = 70 feet, shall be provided at the terminus of every
permanent cul-de-sac. In no case shall a cul-de-sac exceed 750
feet in length.
§ 22-502 FERGUSON CODE § 22-502
FWD:610
D. Design Standards for Local Streets.
(1) Cartway Width and Curbing. Cartway width and curb
requirements shall be determined on the basis of the intensity
of development proposed and the manner in which parking will
be provided, as determined by Chapter 21, Streets and
Sidewalks.
(2) Moving Lanes. All local streets shall be provided with two
continuous moving lanes, within which no required parking is
permitted.
(3) Engineering Criteria. All features of the geometric design of
local streets that are not specified below shall meet a design
speed of 25 miles per hour:

requirements and standards for preparation of a traffic impact
study satisfying the reporting requirements of Ferguson Township
for any development, subdivision, expansion or change in use
within the Township. Also specified are the traffic level of service
standards and minimum requirements which must be satisfied for
future development impacts.
(1) Traffic Study Requirements. A traffic impact study (TIS) shall
be required as outlined below. The estimated number of trips
shall be determined by either an analysis of similar uses
through data collected by the Institute of Transportation
§ 22-502 FOREWORD § 22-502
FWD:617

deemed acceptable to the Township Engineer.
(a) Any development, subdivision, expansion or change in use
which will generate, on the average, 75 or more additional
trips during any peak hour shall be required to have a TIS
completed as part of the development.
(b) When a TIS is prepared for a subdivision that does not
propose development of the lots, the TIS may be required
to be updated at the time of land development of the lots to
address the specific type and size of development that
differs from the original TIS assumptions.
(c) The Township may require a traffic study for developments
or changes in use generating fewer than 75 additional
vehicles during peak hours in cases where known traffic
deficiencies exist in the area of the proposed development
or change in use.
(d) The Township may waive the TIS requirement for an
individual subdivision or development or change in use
where said development or change in use was
incorporated as part of a previous traffic impact study or
studies by the Township or other government agencies.
(e) The TIS shall only be valid for the duration of the
development assumptions contained within the TIS. If a
phased development occurs over a longer time than
studied, a new TIS shall be required.
(f) The TIS shall be completed consistent with criteria
required by PennDOT.
(2) Report Contents and Scope. Prior to performing a TIS, the
Township must approve a scope of study specifying the study
area, intersections, methodologies, and any special
requirements. Prior to beginning the study, a TIS scoping
meeting will be scheduled by the applicant to develop and
review the scope of work. PennDOT will be invited to the
meeting when appropriate (access to state highway or
potential traffic signal mitigation). The study shall include the
following:
(a) Description of the proposed project in terms of land use
and magnitude.

traffic volumes (site traffic plus future roadway
traffic). Note: if the study is required for PennDOT
review, the future design year shall be consistent with
PennDOT requirements.
2) Intersection levels of service.
3) Roadway levels of service (where appropriate).
4) A pavement analysis of roadways which are projected
to experience significant increases in ADT volumes
(where appropriate).

stipulate, among other things:
§ 22-503 FOREWORD § 22-504
FWD:621
(a) That said street(s) shall be maintained, cleared of snow
and ice, and remain passable at all times. The distribution
of the cost of said maintenance for the private street
among all adjacent property owners shall be set forth. The
area of street to be maintained shall be from the nearest
intersection of the private street(s) with the public street
to the intersection with another street, or the end of the
private street.
(b) That failure of the developer or other parties to the
agreement to maintain the street in a passable condition at
all times shall be sufficient reason for the Township to
enter the street in an emergency to maintain, to clear
snow and ice, and to make the street passable and, to bill
the responsible parties for the cost of said work. If the
parties fail to pay said charges, the Township may collect
the charges through a municipal lien plus interest, costs
and attorney fees. Forced maintenance by the Township
under this section shall not be construed as the Township's
acceptance, or potential acceptance, of the street.
(c) That said street(s) shall conform to municipal
specifications with respect to design construction
standards and right-of-way at the time of the offer of
dedication or when surety is posted in an amount approved
by the Township for the improvements to the street to
bring it into conformance with the municipal specifications
in effect on the date of the dedication.

thereon shall be binding on the owners of the remaining
lots with respect to offering the private street for public
dedication.
(e) That at any intersection of the private street with a public
street, a sign no larger than two square feet shall be
erected and maintained by the developer that states "This
is a private street and is the end of Township road
maintenance."
(3) Private Streets Offered for Public Dedication. Upon receipt of a
petition of the owners of 60% of the front footage of the private
street, the Board of Supervisors may authorize the acceptance
of said street, provided:
(a) That the right-of-way, for the classification of street, as
determined by the Township Engineer, is dedicated and
deeded to the Township.
(b) That the street is constructed pursuant to the currently
adopted street standards.

where the agreement is recorded.
(5) Any newly created lot(s) shall have a provision placed in the
deed of conveyance that the access for said lot(s) is via a
private street and subject to the agreement recorded in Deed
Book_____, Page_____.
B. Double or Reverse Frontage. Double or reverse frontage lots shall
be avoided, except where required to prevent direct access to
arterial streets, or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography or orientation.
C. Arterial Streets. Where a lot abuts an arterial street and an existing
local and/or collector street, access shall be from the local or
collector street only. Where this chapter requires installation of a
local, marginal access, or other type of street parallel to an arterial
street, all lots abutting such local, marginal access, or other type
shall derive access solely therefrom.
3. Zoning Requirements. Lot dimensions and areas shall be not less than
specified by the provisions of Chapter 27, Zoning, unless a variance is
first granted under provisions of said chapter. No parcel may be
subdivided which will create a nonconforming lot or building setback.
No parcel may be subdivided which would require, for building
purposes, encroachment into floodplains or steep slopes in order to
meet other requirements of Chapter 27, Zoning.

bikeways/shared-use paths, and off-street parking as appropriate to
the use proposed. Prior to the preparation of plans, developers of
large tracts should review minimum standards for suitability and
desirability of various community facilities applicable to the tract
being subdivided with the Township staff, the staff of the Centre
Region Parks and Recreation Department and the Ferguson
Township Planning Commission.
C. Unity. It is desirable for the intended parkland to be in several wellplaced,
adequately sized areas within the Township, so that it can
accommodate the anticipated uses.
2. Parks, Open Space and Recreational Facilities.
§ 22-512 FERGUSON CODE § 22-513
FWD:630
A. The purpose of this section is to ensure that adequate parks and
recreational facilities are provided to meet the needs of residents
as these needs are generated by new subdivision and land
development activity.
B. The provisions of this section shall apply to all developments with
either single- or multiple-family dwellings.
(1) Established lots for agriculture within the RA or RR Zoning
Districts will not be assessed a fee for any of the one or more
dwelling units that could be established on the farm lot.
However, should said lot(s) undergo further subdivision for any
residential lots the appropriate fee shall be applied as a
condition of approval at the time of any such subdivision.
(2) In mixed-use development and/or mixed-use structures, where
a combination of residential and nonresidential units is
proposed, the fee-in-lieu will be applicable to all proposed
residential units and shall be assessed as a condition of final
plan approval.
(3) For applications with more than four lots and measuring less
than one mile away from the perimeter of a Centre Region
Parks and Recreation facility. The amount of parkland to be
dedicated in each development shall be determined based
upon the calculation identified within Township Fee Schedule
or approved equivalent. Said radius measurements shall be
taken from the radius of the outermost perimeter of lots
included in the application. The Centre Region Parks and
Recreation Department policy on acceptance of maintenance
of parkland requires parks to be equal to or larger than four
acres.
(4) The developer shall place a note on each subdivision plan or
land development plan which is subject to dedication of
parkland that shall read as follows:
(a) "No more than [insert number] dwelling units may be
constructed on the land which is the subject of this
subdivision plan [land development plan] unless additional
land is dedicated to the Township of Ferguson for parkland
and/or the Board of Supervisors accepts an additional feein-
lieu of dedication of parkland. The land shown on this
plan as parkland, consisting of _____ acres, shall be deeded
to Ferguson Township by a deed of general warranty, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances. Said land shall be
available for Ferguson Township use consistent with its
ordinances and regulations with no restriction, except that
the purpose of the conveyance shall be for public park and
recreation uses."
§ 22-513 FOREWORD § 22-513
FWD:631
C. The Township will officially accept the parkland at the time of final
plan approval, provided the land meets the criteria set forth in
§ 22-513, Subsection 2E. At such time, a general warranty deed
free from all encumbrances shall be recorded for the dedicated
land and it shall contain the following restrictive clause:
(1) "This land was dedicated to the Township of Ferguson for
perpetual public park purposes pursuant to the Township of
Ferguson Subdivision Ordinance."
D. The Township or its designee shall be responsible for maintaining
all dedicated and accepted areas. Formation of and cooperation
with homeowners' associations or similar organizations for
purposes of maintenance shall be required, but the responsibility of
seeing that the work is done shall remain with the Township.
E. The Board of Supervisors shall determine if the land is acceptable
for dedication based on the following and any other relevant
criteria:
(1) Access. The dedicated land must be readily accessible to all
development residents that it is intended to serve. The
dedicated land shall about a public street and shall have a
minimum frontage of 50 feet or shall adjoin and become part of
an already existing park area which is accessible from a public
street. If appropriate, access to the park from other parts of
the neighborhood shall be provided through twenty-foot access
easements with ten-foot wide paved walkways.
(2) Location. The parkland shall be located, to the extent possible,
so that it equally serves all residents of the development, but in
all events the land shall be accessible to those it is designated
to serve. In some instances, the Township may require that the
parkland be placed in a location where it may be combined
with existing parkland from an adjacent development. In
determining the location, reference should be made to the
Township's Recreation, Parks and Open Space Plan to
determine if there are proposed parkland locations in the
vicinity of the site.
(3) Shape. The majority of the parkland shall have a length-towidth
ratio of no more than 2 1/2 to one. The shape shall be
suitable to accommodate those park activities appropriate to
the location and needs of the residents. Yards, court areas,
setbacks, and other open areas required by zoning and other
regulations are not to be included as part of the acreage to be
dedicated.
(4) Soils, Floodplain and Stormwater Facility. Soil shall be suitable
for the intended park uses. No parkland may be located on or
within any drainageway, wetland area, steep slope area or
stormwater detention basin, with the exception that up to 25%
§ 22-513 FERGUSON CODE § 22-513
FWD:632
of the total parkland may be located within a floodplain with
approval of the Board of Supervisors.
(5) Slope. The majority of the park shall have a slope of no more
than 4%, and the average slope of the park, as measured
perpendicular to the contour lines, shall not exceed 8%.
(6) Size. The minimum parcel size shall be no less than four acres.
(7) Utilities.
(a) The major piece(s) of dedicated land are to be accessible
to, but not crossed above the surface by, a public street(s),
telephone, power, fuel, water and sewer lines, etc. If any of
these facilities are placed underground, no part of them or
their supportive equipment shall protrude above ground
level within an active play area. When parkland is to be
dedicated to the Township, utilities such as water, sewer,
and electric shall be extended to the parkland. The
location of the utility extensions shall be approved by the
Township.
F. Pedestrian and Bicycle Paths. Pedestrian and bicycle paths may be
accepted as parkland if they meet all the following conditions:
(1) The minimum width of the parkland right-of-way or easement
shall be 20 feet.
(2) The pedestrian and bicycle paths shall have logical beginning
and ending points that provide appropriate means of access to
a park or other facilities residents of the development are likely
to use.
(3) The cost of improving the pedestrian or bicycle path shall be
paid by the developer in order to accommodate its intended
use. This shall not be considered as a credit towards a fee-inlieu
of land dedication.
(4) The provisions of Subsection 2E(3) and (5), "Shape," and,
"Slope," must still be met by the development.
G. The developer shall be responsible for complying with the
provisions of Chapter 26, Stormwater Management. The
stormwater management site plan submitted to the Township for
the subject development must provide mechanisms to ensure
effective stormwater management for the dedicated parkland
property.
H. Fee in Lieu of Dedication.
(1) The payment of fee-in-lieu of land dedication shall be in
accordance with the requirements of Article V, § 503(11) of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247), as
§ 22-513 FOREWORD § 22-513
FWD:633
§ 22-514. Source Water Protection Overlay District Design
Standards. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
amended, 53 P.S. § 10503(11). The fee-in-lieu of parkland shall
be used to enhance public recreation areas which will directly
or indirectly benefit future inhabitants of the development or
subdivision providing the fee.
(2) If it is determined that there is not land suitable for dedication,
or that the subdivision is too small to allow for a suitable
amount of land for dedication, or that it is not practical to
dedicate land, or that there already exists an adequate amount
of parkland and recreational facilities, or the location of
parkland within the proposed subdivision is not consistent with
the adopted Ferguson Township Recreation Parks and Open
Space Plan, a fee-in-lieu shall be considered by the developer.
Such determination shall be made at the preliminary plan
stage. The parkland fee per person shall be established by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
(3) After receiving the recommendation of Ferguson Township
staff, the Centre Regional Planning Agency, the Ferguson
Township Parks and Recreation Committee, and the Centre
Region Parks and Recreation Department, the Ferguson
Township Board of Supervisors may determine that a fee-inlieu
would be more beneficial to the Township residents than a
land dedication for parkland. The following procedure shall be
utilized to determine the appropriate fee-in-lieu:
(a) As part of the plan approval process, the Township
Manager, under the direction of the Board of Supervisors,
shall send written notice to the developer that the Board
has determined a fee-in-lieu would be more beneficial to
the Township's residents than the dedication of parkland.
(b) Neighborhood/Community Park Fee-in-Lieu. See Township
Fee Schedule or approved equivalent for said calculation.
I. The Board of Supervisors may, at its option, and with the
developer's agreement, require the dedication of some land and the
payment of a fee-in-lieu of dedication for the balance. This will be
determined based on existing parkland being located adjacent to
the proposed subdivision or land development plan and the desire
to expand the existing parkland.
J. The Board of Supervisors may establish by resolution a fee to be
paid in addition to the dedication of land to fund the costs of
preparing a park master plan or to update an existing park master
plan.

Part 5A
DESIGN STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE TERRACED
STREETSCAPE DISTRICT
§ 22-5A01. Intent. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
§ 22-5A02. Purpose. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
§ 22-5A03. Statutory Authority. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. The standards included in this Part 5A are intended to establish
guidelines for development activity in the area designated as the
"Terraced Streetscape Zoning District" on the Township's Official
Zoning Map. The district generally extends from the Township
boundary on the east to Blue Course Drive on the west and from West
Campus Drive on the north to Beaver Avenue on the south.
2. These guidelines are intended to aid the Township and property owners
in making sensitive and appropriate decisions with regard to the built
environment and quality of space within the district. Adherence to
these design standards will ensure that the built environment is
attractive and harmonious, with both other parts of the built
environment and the natural environment. It will also promote vitality
and a pedestrian focused area that is distinguishable in character from
the surrounding area.
1. Design guidelines provide a common basis for making decisions about
design elements that affect individual properties as well as the overall
character of the district. The guidelines are not intended to dictate
solutions but rather provide general information to guide the Township
and property owners in making decisions by providing appropriate
choices for a variety of specific design issues. The guidelines are
intended to inform the community and property owners of the policies
and standards expected by the Township within the established district
and to ensure quality development that enhances the character of the
district.
2. The provisions of this Part 5A also identify several design approaches
that will enhance both the appearance and potential value of existing
properties within the district and help to ensure that the desired
character is established uniformly.
3. This Part 5A will serve as a guide to the Township but will not
necessarily dictate the final outcome. Each project has unique
circumstances that will be considered and result in the Township
applying the standards on a project-by-project basis; ensuring that the
character of individual structures observes the fundamental standards
of quality anticipated within the district.
1. Pursuant to § 708-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,47
the written and graphic design guidelines included herein are
§ 22-5A01 FOREWORD § 22-5A03
FWD:637
§ 22-5A04. Goals. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
established to assist applicants in the preparation of land development
plans for projects within the Terraced Streetscape Zoning District. The
design guidelines take effect only when a project is initiated by a
property owner or tenant to alter an existing structure or to construct
a new one. The guidelines do not require existing properties to initiate
changes nor is there any deadline that forces existing properties into
compliance or otherwise alters the nonconforming rights established in
Chapter 27, § 27-803.
2. Property owners, tenants, developers and architects are encouraged to
use these guidelines as a starting point for all projects within the
Terraced Streetscape District. These standards will assist them by
providing a basic framework for planning of a project and serve as a
reference as well as regulatory manual. The Township will apply these
provisions in the review and approval of development proposals and in
the issuance of permits as a measure of the observance of the goals and
intent of the district.
1. The goal of the application of the design standards set forth herein is to
shape and protect the character and appeal of the Terraced Streetscape
District within the Township. These provisions are designed to ensure
that all proposed new construction and renovation or expansion activity
is consistent with the standards of quality as well as respect for the
built environment within the district as it relates to appearance, scale
and density.

§ 22-5A05. Context. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
Development projects within an urban or suburban setting are part of
a larger context that requires that architects, developers, and approval
authorities make decisions within the parameters of an established and
diverse physical setting. Each project within the Terraced Streetscape
District will ultimately become part of the larger neighborhood fabric and
environmental context: a sensitivity to the natural features of land, water
and vegetation in the development project. Buildings within the district
should therefore be planned with the utmost consideration for adjacent
structures and properties while exhibiting compliance with the principal
goals of the district and thoughtfulness for the overall quality of place and
adherence to a sensitivity of natural resources.
§ 22-5A06. Design Principles. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
§ 22-5A07. Synergy. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. Successful urban environments accommodate and foster multiple uses
and activities while simultaneously addressing human scale and safety.
These environments result from the cumulative effect of well-designed
individual sites that are mindful of their context. Enjoyable and pleasant
streetscapes, as well as walkable destinations, combine to give a
neighborhood its recognizable character. To accomplish this, proper
zoning and architectural standards need to be applied.
2. Basic principles of project planning and site design within the Terraced
Streetscape District include:
A. Promote a diversity of uses/occupancies.
B. Create functional pedestrian bikeway and public transit linkages.
C. Foster a distinctive identity that prioritizes high quality design and
development.
D. Incorporate the landscape and green spaces into civic assets.
E. Foster intensity of development and compactness.
F. Use landscaping, green space and existing vegetation to address
traffic calming, issues of identity, territoriality and privacy.
G. Ensure the perception of safety by way of proper lighting/sightline
strategies.
1. The district is designed to encourage as much density and mix of
occupancies as is practical. It is the synergy of diverse and
complimentary uses that make a mixed-use neighborhood experientially
rich and attractive. In such mixed-use settings, the issues of identity,
territoriality and privacy need to be addressed as do connectivity to
public common areas, gathering spaces, public transit, and retail and
§ 22-5A05 FOREWORD § 22-5A07
FWD:639
§ 22-5A08. Density. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
The issue of proper density and compactness can be measured in several
ways. Standards of density derived from national guidelines established
by the Congress for New Urbanism will be used as a basis for proposed
projects in the Terraced Streetscape District. Nonresidential development
should achieve a density whereby the floor area ratio (FAR) for the site
is 1.0 or greater. Any residential development within a vertical mixed-use
structure should achieve a minimum density of 10 units/acre or higher.
These recommended densities, when enhanced by proper attention to
articulation and detail and integrated with the planned streetscape design,
will lend themselves to a more urban and vibrant neighborhood along the
West College Avenue corridor.
§ 22-5A09. Streetscape Design Standards. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/
2019]
service operations. Awareness of these issues and a balanced approach
to the definition of space and the associated access is required.
2. Single-development projects that integrate both commercial and
residential components shall locate the commercial uses on the ground
floor level, so as to encourage direct interface with pedestrians. Office
functions may occupy upper stories above the first floor. Residential
uses in a vertical mixed-use structures, however, may only occupy
upper floors above the ground floor, and above any commercial uses.
1. The West College Avenue Corridor is intended to be the center and focal
point of the district. The corridor is conducive to density and mixed-use
development and is intended to be accompanied by streetscape
treatment that is pedestrian friendly and consistent with the following
design requirements or any officially adopted streetscape plan:
A. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of 12 feet in depth from back of curb
to building face along West College Avenue.
(1) Sidewalks shall be scored in patterns that modulate the scale
of the sidewalk and may include a variety of dimensional sizes
including square, rectangular or diagonal patterns at the
applicant's discretion and in keeping with the intent of the
design standards.
(2) All score lines shall utilize a twice-tooled troweled edge on all
pattern joints, including construction and expansion joints. In
the case of stamped or colored concrete, this requirement may
be modified at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors.
(3) All curbs, sidewalks, handicapped ramps and crosswalks shall
be designed and constructed in accordance with the latest
official version of the Americans with Disabilities Act.48
§ 22-5A07 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A09
FWD:640
(4) All proposed sidewalks, curbs, crosswalks shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with the provisions and
specifications established by the Township and specified herein
or in an officially adopted streetscape plan.
B. A two-foot-wide minimum paver accent band shall be installed
along the back of the curbline along all sidewalks on West College
Avenue. The pavers shall be standard four inches by eight inches
brick size, red color. Pavers may be traditional clay brick or pressed
concrete. Color and pattern of the paver field may include various
size pavers and colors at the discretion of the applicant, subject to
approval by the Board of Supervisors.
(1) Decorative brick, concrete pavers or pavement treatments
shall be considered as an integrated feature to properties on
gateway corners in the Township, the main entrance of
buildings, public plazas, pedestrian access areas and public
roads as noted.
(2) Street signs, regulatory signs, wayfinding signs, utility poles,
streetlighting, utility appurtenances and traffic signal poles are
to be placed within the paver accent band unless otherwise
required by ordinance or upon review by the Township
Engineer.
C. Four-foot-wide by twenty-foot-long minimum, planter beds shall be
incorporated parallel to the curbline adjacent to West College
Avenue. Construction of these beds to function as rain gardens, in
accordance with Township construction standards, is encouraged.
Measurement shall be from outside edge to outside edge of
planting area.
(1) Planters shall be spaced a minimum of 40 feet on center for the
width of the proposed lot or length of the unit block where the
site is located. The spacing and location may be adjusted
dependent on site conditions, clear sight triangles and at the
discretion of the Township Engineer and Board of Supervisors.
(2) Planters may intersect the two-foot side accent paver bans as
noted above.
48.Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101.
§ 22-5A09 FOREWORD § 22-5A09
FWD:641
(3) Planters shall be curbed with brick or pavers to match adjacent
paver accent band or other materials consistent with the
architecture of the proposed project. In no case shall the width
and height of the raised curb exceed six inches in either
direction. Planter edge may include a decorative metal fencing
garden edge to accent and highlight the planting area. The
fencing may be part of the raised curb or independent thereof.
In no case shall the fencing exceed 24 inches in height.
(4) Planters shall be backfilled with CU-Structural Soil® or
approved equal for the full length and width of the planter to a
depth of three feet where feasible or otherwise directed by the
Township Engineer.
(5) Planter areas shall be planted with a perennial, semi- or
evergreen ground cover as a year-round base planting.
Planters shall also incorporate seasonal plantings to provide
four season visual interest. The applicant shall provide a list of
proposed seasonal plantings to be provided and maintained by
the property owner and/or tenant. These may include but are
not limited to tulips, impatiens, petunias, mums and
ornamental kale. The use of ornamental grasses, perennials,
and ornamental shrubs is also encouraged.
(6) The planting plan for the accent planting beds shall be
prepared and sealed by a Pennsylvania registered landscape
architect.
(7) Where feasible, applicants are encouraged to utilize and
incorporate planter areas into the project's overall stormwater
management strategy as bioretention/water quality filter
areas. The use of planter areas as a stormwater best
management practice (BMP) will be subject to review and
approval by the Township Engineer and must be consistent
with the Township's overall stormwater management plan and
objectives for improving water quality and reducing runoff
volumes.
D. Pedestrian scale, period-style lighting standards shall be used
along the West College Avenue street edge, immediately adjacent
to the proposed project site. The horizontal spacing of the light
§ 22-5A09 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A09
FWD:642
fixtures shall be consistent with meeting required light levels
established by Township ordinance.
(1) Streetlights shall utilize decorative, fluted or tapered poles
with decorative base covers to match the style of pole.
(2) Poles shall be cast iron, steel or aluminum, painted black.
(3) Poles shall be located within the proposed paver accent band.
(4) Streetlight lamps shall incorporate night sky friendly, energy
efficient, full cut-off optics. The use of LED technology is
encouraged.
(5) Poles along West College Avenue shall incorporate banner
brackets for upper and lower banner arms, to hang one banner,
perpendicular to the street edge.
(6) Poles along West College Avenue shall include provisions for
two planter arms, one on each side of the pole, parallel to the
street edge.
(7) Poles along West College Avenue shall include provisions for
one exterior rated duplex electrical outlet located immediately
below the point of attachment between luminaire and pole.
E. To mitigate the negative impacts of heat island effects, a minimum
of one street tree shall be planted in the center of each four-foot-bytwenty-
foot accent planting bed. The selected species and sizing of
tree shall be in accordance with Chapter 25, Trees. Shrub varieties
shall be included in a landscaping and planting plan prepared and
sealed by a Pennsylvania registered landscape architect and
approved by the Township Tree Commission.
F. Each project with frontage on West College Avenue shall include
the provision of site furnishings consistent with the intended
creation of an inviting, safe and enjoyable pedestrian experience.
These furnishings may include benches, trash and recycling
receptacles, bike racks, bus shelters, and individual freestanding
planters.

FWD:643
§ 22-5A10. Building Design and Facade Considerations. [Ord. No.
1050, 11/18/2019]
Issues of character, aesthetic contribution, scale, proportion and material
quality shall all be evenly considered along with the traditional measures of
zoning and code compliance when evaluating building design. To minimize
subjectivity in the consideration of these elements, the following guidelines
shall be considered.
(1) Site furnishings shall be constructed of nonbiodegradable,
vandal resistant materials such as cast iron, steel, aluminum,
or recycled plastic components.
(2) Site furnishings shall be period style consistent with the
overall character of the area or any officially adopted
Streetscape Plan.
(3) Site furnishings shall be from a coordinated family of
furnishings by the same manufacturer unless otherwise
approved by the Township.
(4) Benches shall be a minimum of six feet in length and shall
incorporate a center armrest.
(5) Trash receptacles shall be a minimum of thirty-two-gallon
capacity and shall utilize the smallest possible semicovered top
opening to prevent the deposition of large trash bags or
household debris.
(6) Recycling receptacles shall be provided and incorporated
consistent with Centre Region refuse and recycling
requirements.
(7) Benches and receptacles shall be grouped together along the
street edge but not within the required accent paver band.
Where feasible, these groupings may occur between accent
planting beds when two or more beds are included along the
frontage of a project.
(8) Bus shelters may be incorporated subject to the review and
approval of CATA. The style of shelter shall be consistent with
the overall site furnishings palette.
2. Streets perpendicular to the West College Avenue Corridor will also
provide for a variety of uses, but at a slightly reduced scale. The
sidewalks and streetscape treatment along these streets will be
correspondingly reduced in scale, with fixtures and landscape features
more conducive to a side street location.
§ 22-5A09 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A10
FWD:644
§ 22-5A11. Building Massing and Composition. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/
18/2019]
1. Consideration toward scale and the transition of building height from
one site to the next must be taken into account. While abrupt changes
in scale between two adjacent properties are generally discouraged,
articulation of the building to address relevant issues of scale combined
with appropriate setbacks and landscaping can help soften these
transitions. Graduated massing of building heights is preferred and
should be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the
district as specified herein as well as in Chapter 27, Zoning.
2. Larger infill development that respects massing and articulation
becomes a harmonious part of the block.
3. Structures on West College Avenue are to be located on or near the
street line as to engender a physical presence on the main thoroughfare
and support a more pedestrian-centered focus. Parking areas in front of
buildings are prohibited, as are any other features that detract from
pedestrian access to the front of the building. Building entrances shall
be designed in such a manner as to be immediately recognizable,
accessible and safe.
A. It is the intent of the district to create the greatest practical
commercial density along the West College Avenue corridor.
Commercial occupancies perform best when they are visible and
easily accessible. Storefronts are to be designed to be as open and
transparent as practical in accordance with the district regulations.
§ 22-5A10 FOREWORD § 22-5A12
FWD:645
§ 22-5A12. Articulation of Facades. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. Development projects within the Terraced Streetscape District shall be
mindful of the fact that well-articulated building facades provide visual
interest and enhance the experience of the neighborhood. Whereas
large unarticulated building masses can negate any sense of human
scale within the block, large buildings that are sensible in their
composition and reverent to the scale of pedestrians are generally more
successful and appealing.
A. New buildings in the district shall observe some of the basic
parameters of scale and proportion (see examples below). It is the
intent of these regulations to ensure that no single building appear
too diminutive as to defy the basic tenets of the district which
requires that landowners maximize the volume and development
potential of their site.
(1) Single-story building facades are required to convey a greater
sense of height, consistent with the scale of adjacent or
surrounding multistory structures, through use of a parapet.
All structures fronting on West College Avenue shall conform
to the building height regulations of the district.
(2) All structures shall convey the greatest practical density and
vibrancy by way of articulating multiple occupancy/tenancy
through appropriate ground floor storefront design. This will
enhance the pedestrian experience as well as improve the
massing of larger commercial structures.
B. Streetscapes and building facade design in the district are required
to execute the rhythm created by many individual facades and
storefronts that relate to the scale of the pedestrian. A building's
massing shall contribute positively to a pedestrian-friendly public
realm. Long, unbroken walls are overwhelming and must be
divided into rhythmic blocks bringing the design of the facade
closer to a human scale.
C. Larger buildings are required to subdivide the appearance of their
facades and storefronts, as to make them seem to be smaller,
§ 22-5A12 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A12
FWD:646
individual buildings. Articulation by means of material difference,
color difference, and vertical/horizontal variation in alignment,
recesses or projections are required to accomplish the appearance
of individual facades.
(1) The upper floors of multistory buildings are required to provide
a differentiation of color or material to break up the facade
massing of the building exterior.
(2) Storefronts and facade treatment at ground level must be
differentiated every 40 feet or less, to provide proper
articulation at street level.
D. The ground floor of any multistory building is required to be
articulated from the stories above it. The appearance of a
specialized and welcoming storefront, building entrance or any
other pedestrian appropriate treatment is required to enhance the
pedestrian street life generated in the district.
E. Where buildings of 55 feet or higher are proposed, in addition to
articulating their ground floor, articulation of their uppermost
floor(s) must occur as well.
F. Facade treatment of multistory buildings should also include
appropriate consideration in the design of the top of the building.
§ 22-5A12 FOREWORD § 22-5A12
FWD:647
§ 22-5A13. Storefront Design. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
Rooflines for pitched roof structures should be articulated to
subdivide the mass and appearance of the roof area toward the
predominant facade. Strategies include the introduction of
dormers, roofed vents, chimney stacks, or variation in finished
rooflines.
G. Facade treatment for flat roofed buildings shall include parapets,
built-up cornices or both, as appropriate to the architectural style
of the proposed building. Building tops shall be visually interesting,
and compliment the character of the building, as well as
contributing positively to the character of the district.
H. Multistory buildings, due to their size and presence, are
encouraged to be creative in their use of massing, articulation and
design. Developers of multistory buildings shall consider their
appearance from multiple vantage points.
1. Commercial occupancies at ground floor level, especially spaces
intended for retail or restaurant uses, are required to incorporate
standards for successful storefront design. Good storefront design
integrates means of maximizing transparency and openness with
durability and energy efficiency.
A. Storefronts need to be differentiated (every 40 feet, maximum)
from one another to create an attractive and visual interest for
pedestrians. The surface area of storefronts in the district is
required to be 50% (minimum) transparent (glass), to optimize
public viewing. This will enhance the pedestrian experience.
§ 22-5A12 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A13
FWD:648
§ 22-5A14. Corner Building Sites. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
B. Storefronts shall be constructed with durable finishes consistent
with the expected high traffic/pedestrian environment.
Consideration must also be given to lighting strategies so that both
the storefront and the interior space behind it are well lit, and
easily seen.
C. Avoid excessive visual clutter; especially that produced by too
much interior signage.
D. Outdoor signage shall fit the character and proportion of the
building and enhance the architecture. Signage shall be clearly
visible without dominating the building facade or obscuring
architectural details.
E. Benches and other moveable objects, such as bike racks or trash
containers, shall be coordinated with the building entrance so as
not to obstruct sidewalk traffic or diminish the appearance of the
facade.
F. Awnings and/or vegetation may be utilized to add interest and
aesthetic quality to the building and the streetscape. Awnings and
canopies must be compatible with the building and windows in
scale, proportion and color.
1. Corner buildings serve as landmarks within the district and, as a result,
special consideration must be given to their design so that they address
the intersection as well as complimenting other, adjacent buildings in
the district.
A. Proposed corner buildings need to address the intersection they
front through the inclusion of accentuating features, such as
towers, turrets, chamfers, canopies or recessed areaways to
highlight their cornermost facades.
(1) Building corners can be accentuated in a variety of ways.
Employing novel geometries while utilizing the same color
palette is a subtle approach while the introduction of more
§ 22-5A13 FOREWORD § 22-5A14
FWD:649
§ 22-5A15. Parking Structures and Incentives. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/
18/2019]
elaborate elements and accent materials and/or color results in
a more predominant/more recognizable structure.
(2) A common approach is to differentiate the bay of the building
that is closest to the corner through the use of offsets,
additional height, and differences in roofline, color or material.
This will help to delineate and symbolically mark the
intersection and physically note its importance.
(3) The creation of additional public space on the corner can be
achieved through the use of a recessed or chamfered entrance
that broadens the common area and makes the space more
usable. Porticos, colonnades, stoops, vegetation, and similar
features fronting the corner further enhance the presence of
the building and improve the visual character.
1. Parking structures and elevated parking decks within the district need
to exhibit sensitivity to scale and massing. These structures also need to
relate to pedestrian scale and attempt to integrate with other
structures in the broader environment by way of articulation and
material usage. A key objective shall be to disguise the structure's
function as car storage through the use of screening elements, spandrel
panels or glazing systems in conjunction with good facade design
strategies.
A. Design strategies that include locating stairwells and/or elevator
towers on a corner or public accessway improves the overall
pedestrian interface with these structures while also improving
their massing. These strategies also open the possibility of
improved articulation, fenestration, and use of materials for facade
enhancement. Lighting can also be employed to further enhance
and accent the structure, providing a visual focal point at night.
(1) Material and/or color usage shall differentiate the ground and
upper floors of the structure to improve the relationship with
pedestrian scale and the streetscape.
(2) Facades shall avoid the appearance of support columns unless
combined with a screening system. Use of masonry, composite
panels or EIFS systems will lend a sense of permanence and
evoke the image of a conventional building rather than an open
deck.
(3) Metal or mesh screening systems can be used to obscure
stored cars. These systems should also employ masonry or
other suitable material so that the resulting facade does not
appear out of character.
§ 22-5A14 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5A15
FWD:650
(4) Glazing or curtain wall systems can also be used to screen cars
and achieve the look of a more conventional building. Window
walls or windows set in a backup wall can be detailed to create
a more uniform and interesting appearance to the overall
structure while concealing its use for parking.
(5) Installation of green roofs can be used to:
(a) Retain rainwater and, together with plants, return a
portion of this water to the atmosphere through
evaporation and transpiration (evapotranspiration).
(b) Reduce and clean stormwater volume.
(c) Retain and delay runoff to ease stress on stormwater
infrastructure and sewers.
B. Storefronts and leasable commercial space shall be incorporated
into the ground floor plan of parking structures. The storefronts
shall enhance the streetscape and conform to the design
requirements of the Terraced Streetscape zoning.
C. Parking Incentives.
(1) The parking requirements for nonresidential development, or
nonresidential uses within vertical mixed-use structures as set
forth herein, may be reduced by use of the following:
(a) Provide additional landscaping and/or open space that is
20% greater than that required by this chapter. Reduce
total required parking spaces by 10%.
§ 22-5A15 FOREWORD § 22-5A15
FWD:651
§ 22-5A16. Exterior Materials. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
§ 22-5A17. Color Selection. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
(b) Provide and maintain at least 10% of the housing units as
age-restricted units. Reduce total required parking spaces
by 15%.
(c) Provide and maintain at least 10% of the housing units as
owner-occupied workforce housing units. Reduce total
required parking spaces by 15%.
(2) The incentives may be mixed or matched, but no incentive may
be used to obtain multiple bonuses. For example, a green roof
may count toward additional impervious on a lot, or an extra
story of structured parking, but not both.
1. Buildings designed with authentic materials in a manner that evidences
craftsmanship and detail lend a sense of authenticity and permanence
to the buildings themselves. Authentic and permanent materials on
building exteriors will provide visual continuity and discernible
character to the zoning district.
A. Authentic materials, such as brick, cast stone, limestone, concrete
block and other conventional masonry products, should be used.
Exterior finish systems and proprietary panel systems can be
employed to the extent that they complement the material quality
of the building and surrounding structures and are used in
combination with more permanent/natural materials (a synthetic or
EIFS clad building with a masonry base detail, for example).
1. In general, it is recommended that the color palette selected for the
building exterior not include exceptionally bright or overly colorful
schemes. Subtle and complimentary color choices, such as more
naturalistic or muted tones, are suggested. However, vibrant colors can
be used for accent and trim.
A. Painted strips or pronounced patterns on wall surfaces or large
surface areas of brilliant color are distracting and shall be avoided.

§ 22-5A19. Lighting. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. It is important that the nature of the signage employed by a business
does not conflict with the character or goals of the district. Good sign
design can both enhance the business and add a dimension of vibrancy
and visual interest.
A. The following recommendations shall be considered:
(1) Signs hung parallel to the business shall not overwhelm the
storefront or architectural detail of the building.
(2) Lighting shall not produce glare and automated signage shall
not be permitted.
(3) Signs should be designed to draw the attention of the
pedestrian rather than motorists within the district. Projecting
signage, hung perpendicular to the building, is recommended.
(4) Graphics should be clear and legible. Limited text or company
colors/logos should be considered over a heavily stylized or
cluttered and confusing sign face.
1. The lighting of buildings, entryways, building surfaces or landscape
within the district is desirable. Exterior lighting will enliven the district
and add a sense of vibrancy as well as enhancing the safety of the area.
The use of energy efficient luminaires or LED lighting is encouraged.
A. Commercial facades in the district should utilize lighting in a
creative and innovative manner to highlight their business.
However, visually distracting and automated signage or moving
lighting shall not be permitted.
B. Lighting that produces glare or impedes the vision of motorists or
pedestrian traffic is prohibited. Surface mounted lighting must
§ 22-5A17 FOREWORD § 22-5A19
FWD:653
have fixtures that are aimed directly at the targeted facade or
surface area and away from traffic.
C. The surface up-lighting of a building is allowed; however, light
spillage or glare onto adjacent buildings or properties is not
permitted.

horticulture, or wetland that is incorporated into the
design for stormwater management.
(3) The regenerative percolation of stormwater runoff may, where
appropriate, be permitted to be included in areas designated
for open or public spaces. Additionally, facilities that are
designed as permanent water features and are provided with
associated walking or seating areas will be credited. However,
stormwater management facilities such as detention basins
and swales shall only be permitted to be included to the extent
that the open space exceeds the 25% required minimum, or
through the use of one or more design incentives identified
below.
(4) In addition to responding to the unique conditions and
environmental resources of the parcel(s), the open space
provided on each site shall be responsive to the needs of the
community as expressed in the Ferguson Township Recreation,
Parks, and Open Space Plan and, to the extent feasible, shall
provide usable play or recreation areas, or equipment, that is
conveniently accessible to residents throughout the
community.
(5) The reservation of passive parkland, which may include
wooded sites, formal gardens, conservation areas, and open
grass spaces, may also be included. However, such facilities
shall account for no more than 40% of the required common
open space. Where the existence of adequate play or
recreation areas within walking distance of a proposed TTD
can be shown, the percentage of passive parkland permitted to
be credited toward the total required common open space may
be raised to as much as 55%.
(6) Public space shall serve as a focal point and may comprise up
to 10% of the usable common open space provided. Such areas
shall be subject to the same maintenance criteria as identified
by § 27-904, Subsection 4C(4)(m).
(7) All common open space shall be publicly accessible either from
a public street or public area, and/or from a pedestrian/bicycle
network that links various playgrounds, parks, commons and
greens to each other as well as to the developed portions of the
site. Land designated as common open space shall be suitable
for the purpose specified.
(8) Each Traditional Town Development site that includes 50 or
more dwelling units shall include at least one public square or
green with a minimum size of 20,000 square feet. Other
squares, greens, commons, or public areas of not less than
10,000 square feet in area shall be dispersed throughout the
development. Each dwelling unit shall be situated so as to be
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:656
located no more than 1,000 feet from a commons, square,
green, or trail.
(a) Existing wooded areas shall be protected to prevent
unnecessary destruction. At least 40% of the number of
trees (minimum trunk caliper of five inches at six inches
above ground) that exist at the time of the plan submission
shall be maintained or replaced immediately following
construction. Invasive tree and nontree species shall,
however, be removed upon identification in coordination
with the Township Arborist. Replacement trees shall be a
minimum trunk caliper of two inches at a height of six
inches above finished grade. The location of replacement
trees shall be detailed on the landscaping plan required by
the specific implementation plan criteria.
(b) No development shall involve uses, activities or
improvements that would entail encroachment into, the
regrading of, or the placement of fill in wetlands in
violation of state or federal regulations. Applicants must
submit evidence to the Township that demonstrates that
the site has been evaluated for the presence of wetlands
and that, if wetlands are present on the site, that DEP and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been contacted to
evaluate the applicability of state and federal wetland
regulations. Full compliance with these regulatory
agencies is expected and will be a condition of any
approval granted by the Township.
(c) Preservation of the required open space within the TTD
shall be irrevocable. A metes and bounds description of the
space to be preserved and limits on its use shall be
recorded on the specific implementation plan, in any
applicable homeowner covenants and on individual deeds
when open space lands are not held entirely in common.
Restriction on future development shall be established by
a permanent and irrevocable instrument.
B. Transportation Network.
(1) Standards.
(a) Pattern and Hierarchy.
1) Street Pattern. Street patterns shall form a network,
with variations as needed for topographic,
environmental, and other design considerations
specific to the site.
2) Culs-de-Sac. The network shall allow for a variety of
modes of transportation and create an interconnected
system that limits the use of isolated culs-de-sac.
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:657
Streets with no vehicular outlet may be used only
where connections are not possible due to topography,
hydrology, or other special resource considerations.
3) Autocourts, T- or Y-turnarounds and looped access
roads shall be considered before determining that a
cul-de-sac is the appropriate design solution.
4) When a cul-de-sac is proposed to be incorporated into
the design of a TTD, the application shall be
accompanied by a written analysis of the merits of the
design and evidence supporting why a network with
through street connections is not a viable alternative.
5) Mobility. The resultant system of streets shall provide
adequate traffic capacity and connected bicycle and
pedestrian routes, control, but not exclude, through
traffic, and require that lot access be accomplished
from streets of lower classification in order to promote
safe and efficient mobility through the site.
6) Public Dedication. All streets shall be dedicated to the
Township. Private streets are prohibited.
7) Organization. Streets shall be organized according to
hierarchy based on function, size, capacity and design
speed. Streets and rights-of-way are, therefore,
expected to differ in dimension. A design proposal that
does not adequately address the provision of a street
hierarchy will not have sufficient diversity to merit
approval. Therefore, design consultants are urged to
give proper consideration to this element of the plan.
8) Design. The design of each street shall be tailored to
function, and anticipated capacity as measured by
average daily trips (ADT). Each street shall be
designed to meet the standards for one of the street
types identified in Chapter 22. Changes in design
along a corridor that are based on context shall be
permitted. However, midblock changes are not
acceptable.
9) Distribution. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
distribution of traffic to the proposed street system
will not exceed the ADT thresholds indicated for any
proposed street type for a design period of 10 years
from the proposed date of completion and acceptance
of the road.
10) Ingress/Egress. The Township may disapprove any
point of ingress or egress to any lot, tract, parcel, or
development from any street when the proposed
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:658
ingress or egress would create unsafe conditions,
reduce the capacity of the adjoining street, or result
in substandard circulation and impaired vehicle
movement. In addition, street systems that do not
adequately distinguish a hierarchy of design will not
be approved.
(b) Motor Vehicle Connections.
1) Interconnection. The design of streets within the
Traditional Town Development shall foster
interconnection to the greatest extent possible. This
shall include connections to streets within the
development, as well as to adjacent developed sites
and to adjacent parcels that are zoned for
development.
2) Traffic Impact Study. All Traditional Town
Development proposals shall submit a traffic impact
study per the requirements of this chapter, and shall
demonstrate conformance with the transit,
pedestrian, and bicycle circulation provisions of this
chapter as well as the design requirements associated
with hierarchy, connectivity, and the preservation of
existing features of the site.
3) Driveways. Driveway locations shall not interfere with
the normal traffic movement or be inconsistent with
the design, maintenance, and drainage of the street.
Driveway access to lots shall always be provided to the
street of lesser classification. The Township may
require the joint or shared use of driveways to provide
ingress and egress when such design would increase
traffic and/or pedestrian safety by decreasing the
potential for turning movements and associated
conflicts.
4) Curb Cuts. Curb cuts for access to residential lots
shall be prohibited along collector and arterial streets.
Curb cuts along these streets shall be limited to
intersections with other streets or access to parking
areas for commercial, civic, or multifamily residential
uses.
5) Alleys. The use of alleys in order to allow for an
uninterrupted and pedestrian-friendly environment
along public streets is permitted. Alleys shall provide
appropriate space for rear access and shall be
designed in accordance with Chapter 21 and Chapter
22.
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:659
6) Townhouse Access. In general, townhouse dwelling
units shall be accessed from the rear. However, in
some instances, front entry garages may be provided
for townhouse dwelling end units. No more than 50%
of the overall number of townhouses dwelling units is
permitted to utilize such front entry garages. Other
than as noted above, garages associated with
townhouse or live/work units shall either be integral to
the structure or oriented to the rear and accessed by a
lane or alley.
7) Three-Way Intersections. Low volume streets may be
designed to form three-way intersections. Such Ts are
encouraged to be used for the creation of prominent
focal points, such as scenic views, important civic
buildings, or public areas.
8) Access to Existing Township Roads. All proposed
development shall access an interior street network
designed and constructed to serve development of the
Traditional Town Development. No new lots shall be
permitted direct access to existing Township or state
roads.
(c) Pedestrian/Bicycle Connections.
1) Circulation System. A convenient, continuous
pedestrian circulation system that minimizes the
opportunity for pedestrian/motor vehicle conflicts
shall be provided throughout the site.
2) Sidewalks. All public streets, except for alleys, shall be
bordered by sidewalks on both sides. However, this
shall not eliminate the need for consideration of
greenways, trails, or other off-street pedestrian routes
that would provide access and circulation through the
site and to existing and proposed external
development. Except for alleys, in no case shall
roadside shoulders or unpaved areas serve as
pedestrian travel areas.
3) Walkways. Where pedestrian access is established in
locations other than along a public street, the width
and material of the walkway shall be consistent with
the intended function. The design of such areas shall
be included as part of the open space plan required by
Subsection 1A(1). The maintenance of such areas shall
rest with the entity responsible for the common open
space.
4) Pedestrian Travel Zone. Where serving predominantly
retail or office uses, sidewalks may need to be wider
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:660
than five feet. A pedestrian travel zone of at least
five feet shall be provided in addition to areas of the
sidewalk that serve as a building frontage zone and/or
fixture/planting zone. See Design Manual (Appendix
27-A) for examples of acceptable design(s).
5) Design Drainage grates, manhole covers, tree wells,
hatches, vaults and other utility coverings should be
located outside of pedestrian areas. However, where
they are present, they shall not have openings greater
than required by ADA and shall be mounted flush with
the level of the surrounding sidewalk/walkway
surface.
6) Lighting. In mixed-use and/or multifamily residential
areas, well-lit walkways shall connect building
entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to
associated parking areas. These walkways shall be a
minimum of five feet in width. All light posts and
fixtures shall be pedestrian friendly as measured by
scale and harshness of the light source. The level of
lighting provided shall range between 0.5 and 2.0
foot-candles dependent on the volume of both
pedestrian and vehicular traffic and the location of the
intersection or walkway. Pole heights for fixtures shall
not exceed 14 feet.
7) Vertical Clearance. All walkways shall include a
minimum vertical clearance of 84 inches.
8) Bicycle Circulation.
a) Provisions for bicycle circulation shall be
incorporated throughout each site. In addition,
the connection and continuation of existing
bicycle trails or existing bicycle routes through
the site shall be required.
b) Where on-street bicycle circulation is to be
provided, it shall be accommodated within the
travel lane of all street classifications except
collector and arterial. For collector and arterial
streets, a separate shared use path shall be
constructed along one side of the street for use of
pedestrians and bicycles. Where proposed, shared
use paths must be designed in accordance with
AASHTO standards. Sidewalks shall not be
designated as bicycle travel routes; however,
shared use paths may be used by pedestrians.
Drainage grates along curbed streets shall be
designed to be safe for crossing by bicycles.
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:661
9) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking is required to be
provided for all public or semipublic areas and for all
nonresidential or multifamily land uses. Bicycle
parking spaces are to be located so as to be
convenient to the structure or use for which they are
provided and to be visible from at least one entrance.
Lighting shall be provided for all such bicycle parking
areas.
(d) Transit Connections.
1) Circulation Plan.
2) A plan for transit circulation within and to each site
shall be coordinated with the local transit authority
and the planned location of such stops shall be
delineated on plans submitted for Township approval.
Stops shall be conveniently located and, where
appropriate, provided with a shelter, seating and
lighting.
3) Where transit stops are provided or a new bus stop/
pulloff is warranted, no parking zones shall be
designated for a minimum of 80 feet to allow for
loading and unloading. Where deemed appropriate,
bus pulloffs or acceleration lanes shall also be
provided.
C. Utilities Network.
(1) Intent. Compact development can be designed to use
infrastructure more efficiently, resulting in lower costs per
capita for the municipality. More users per linear foot of sewer
and water main extensions, as well as lower costs for plowing,
paving, and maintaining narrower, well-connected streets are
intended to be achieved through the coordinated planning
efforts required herein. Additionally, infrastructure that can be
provided from a systems approach, without segregating design
and regulation according to strict property boundaries,
improves connectivity and the overall function of streets,
stormwater systems, open space, and other supporting
infrastructure.
(2) Design Goals.
(a) To ensure the efficient extension of existing public
infrastructure to serve Traditional Town Development in a
coordinated and comprehensive manner.
(b) To ensure the continued function of groundwater
resources by coordinating drainage and stormwater
management.
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:662
(c) To guide the placement of utilities and other infrastructure
in a manner that does not detract from the overall function
and character of the community.
(3) Standards.
(a) Location. All utilities, both main and service lines shall be
provided underground either within private easements or
located within an alley right-of-way or public street rightof-
way.
(b) Integration of Stormwater Management Facilities.
Infrastructure necessary for the management of
stormwater on the site shall be incorporated into the
design in a manner that reduces its visibility as a
functional element and increases its value as an integrated
component of the open space and or public space areas.
1) Open Space Credit. The drainage system shall, where
feasible, be developed as a landscape amenity, such as
a planted swale, grass median, or, where
appropriately located and visually screened, rock
beds. Such design may receive credit for open space
in accordance with the provisions found in incentives,
§ 22-5B01, Subsection 1F.
(c) Sewer and Water Service. All portions of any Traditional
Town Development shall be served by public sewer and
public water. Notice of capacity and intent to serve shall be
provided prior to approval of any specific implementation
plans.
(d) Easements. When outside of right-of-way areas, easements
for sanitary sewer facilities, stormwater drainage
facilities, public or private utilities, or pedestrian access
shall meet the following standards:
1) Location. To the fullest extent possible, easements
shall be adjacent to property lines.
2) Conflicts. Nothing shall be placed, planted, set or put
within the area of an easement that would adversely
affect the function of the easement or conflict with the
required easement agreement.
(e) Screening. Year-round screening of any utility apparatus
appearing above the surface of the ground shall be
required unless such apparatus is placed in a lane or alley.
As a result, the placement of aboveground utility
structures should be coordinated with the proposed
landscape plans, to ensure that they are positioned away
from key focal areas. The visual impact of all rooftop
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:663
mechanical equipment, such as vents, exhaust hoods, and
antennas (including satellite dishes and
telecommunication facilities) shall be minimized by
integrating or screening such appurtenances with the
building design.
(f) Ownership. The location of all existing and proposed
utilities shall be delineated on the general master plan
which shall be accompanied by a narrative designating
which improvements are intended to be dedicated to and
maintained by the Township, and which are to be owned
and maintained by a property owner's association. In
addition, any easements or restrictive covenants
associated with such infrastructure shall be identified.
D. Blocks.
(1) Standards.
(a) Width. Block depth/width (houses back to back) shall
range from 150 feet to 400 feet.
(b) Length. Block length (intersection to intersection) shall
range from 300 feet to 800 feet.
(c) Perimeter. The maximum block perimeter shall be 2,000
linear feet. This will serve as the controlling dimension. No
block shall exceed this dimension without an alley or
pedestrian easement providing through access. Blocks
above 1,500 linear feet shall also consider the inclusion of
pedestrian easements or other nonvehicular elements to
reduce the perceived walking distance between street
intersections.
E. Parking, Parking Lots, Parking Structures.
(1) Standards.
(a) Separation Distance. On-street parking spaces shall not be
located within 15 feet of a street, driveway, or access drive
intersection. Additional separation distance may be
necessary under certain circumstances to accommodate
the required clear sight distance.
(b) Off-Street Parking. Where necessary to meet the
applicable standards or to provide shared parking
arrangements, off-street parking compounds may be
provided on the lot containing the principal use which
necessitates such vehicle storage. No more than 60% of
the required parking for residential or nonresidential uses
shall be accommodated in this fashion.
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:664
(c) Distance. Where off-street parking is required, it may be
located on-site or, if, located within 1,500 feet of the use
for which it is required, in off-street community or shared
parking facilities/structures which are encouraged to be
provided. Rear vehicular access to all parking facilities
shall be provided in lieu of access from the primary street
frontage.
(d) Number of Spaces. The total amount of parking provided
(on- and off-street) shall not exceed the amount required
by Part 5C. However, if all parking is accommodated with
on-street spaces, this number may be reduced by 10%.
Additionally, the provisions to reduce off-street parking
spaces, as provided in Part 5C, shall be applicable.
(e) Dimensions. Parking space and associated aisle
dimensions for off-street parking shall be as specified by
Part 5C.
(f) Location and Access. When proposed, off-street parking
facilities shall be accessed by alley or midblock drives with
spaces located underneath, or to the side or rear of the
structures they are intended to serve. Exceptions include
those residential lots approved for front access consistent
with the provisions of § 22-5B01, Subsection 1B(1)(b)4),
where front-entry garages are permitted to accommodate
off-street parking, and where off-site parking is
accommodated in parking structures.
(g) Screening. If design dictates that off-street parking is to be
located to the side of a building, the entire parking
perimeter that fronts a street or adjacent property shall be
screened with a combination of a low architectural wall or
fencing and a continuous shrub and tree row that
adequately screens the parking and defines the street
edge.
1) Design. The design of such areas shall be included in
the required landscape plan.
2) Bioretention. Designing such perimeter landscape
areas to serve as bioretention facilities is encouraged.
3) Setback. The setback of an off-street parking area
located to the side of a building shall be consistent
with the adjacent buildings. In no instance shall the
off-street parking area be located beyond the front
building setback line of adjacent structures.
(h) Size. The size and location of parking compounds shall not
compromise the design or provision of pedestrian access.
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:665
(i) Pedestrian Access. Parking areas shall include clearly
defined and marked pedestrian walkways within (not
simply around) the parking area, providing access to the
entrances of establishments. Pedestrian access to the
primary entrances of each structure shall be clearly
distinguished from motor vehicle entrances.
1) Material. This walkway shall be distinguished from
driving surfaces through the use of special pavers,
bricks, scored concrete, stamped concrete, or a raised
surface.
2) Design. Parking area walkways shall be a minimum of
17 feet in width. This is to accommodate a five-foot
walkway bounded by two six-foot planting strips
planted with a continuous shrub or hedgerow and
shade trees planted alternately on each side of the
sidewalk at a maximum ratio of one tree for every 45
feet.
3) Landscaping. Landscaping that defines pedestrian
access and/or separates it from automobile routes
elsewhere within the site is strongly encouraged. The
use of such areas to contribute to the on-site reduction
of stormwater runoff is appropriate.
(j) Multi-Use Parking Requirements. All nonresidential and
multifamily uses shall adequately accommodate both
handicap parking and bicycle parking. See § 22-5C02 for
appropriate standards.
(k) Siting Criteria. Parking lots or structured parking facilities
shall not abut street intersections or civic buildings, be
adjacent to squares or parks, or occupy lots which
terminate a vista.
(l) Access to Adjacent Areas. Parking facilities shall not be
permitted within side or rear setbacks unless formal
arrangements have been made for the establishment of a
common parking facility as specified in § 22-5C01,
Subsection 1A(2)(a). However, both pedestrian and
vehicular access between adjacent off-street parking areas
shall be designed such that these areas, when located on
adjacent parcels, are connected in a manner that
minimizes the need to return to a main street. If the
adjacent parcel is undeveloped or vacant, a connecting
drive or street shall be extended to the lot line for access
to future development.
(m) Landscaping. Parking areas shall be suitably landscaped to
minimize noise, glare, heat mitigation, and other nuisance
characteristics as well as enhance the environment,
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:666
stormwater management and ecology of the site and
surrounding area. At a minimum, all surface parking areas
shall be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of
§ 27-707, Subsection 14A through F.
(n) Parking Structures. Parking structures provided for public
or common use, and not affiliated with specific commercial
or office uses in the TTD shall only be permitted where the
ground floor is dedicated to commercial or office uses
consistent with those permitted in the TTD.
1) Size. Such structures shall not exceed 50% of any
given block.
2) Visibility. Parked vehicles shall not be visible from
adjacent public space.
3) Architectural Elements. Parking structures shall
conform to guidelines pertaining to architectural
scaling elements and building materials.
4) Permitted Uses. Such structures may incorporate
residential uses as well as retail development.
5) Density Bonuses. Density bonuses may be available in
return for the provision of parking structures as
provided in § 22-5B01, Subsection 1F.
6) Landscaping. Interior landscaping requirements are
not applicable to structured parking whether
underground or multistory. However, exterior
buffering or screening standards may be applicable to
such facilities depending on their size, location, and
proposed design.
(o) Back-Up Area. All dead-end parking lots shall be designed
to provide, when necessary, sufficient back-up area for all
end stalls.
(p) Circulation. Painted lines, arrows, and dividers shall be
provided and maintained to control parking and, when
necessary, to direct vehicular circulation.
(q) Shared Parking. For mixed-use structures, a shared
parking approach to the provision of off-street parking
shall be permitted following the methodology described in
the publication Shared Parking (Urban Land Institute and
Barton Aschman Associates, Inc., Urban Land Institute,
1984).
(r) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking facilities shall be provided
for all nonresidential, mixed-use, and multifamily
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:667
structures within the TTD in accordance with the
following:
1) Visibility. Bicycle parking devices shall be convenient
to the structure for which they are provided. They
shall be visible from at least one entrance to the
structure and shall be appropriately illuminated.
2) Location. Bicycle parking devices shall permit at least
two feet of free space between any bicycle attached to
the device and the edge of the curb or sidewalk. For
areas where motor vehicles are permitted to park
overhanging the curb or sidewalk, the distance shall
be increased to four feet. Along driveways having no
curb or sidewalk, the minimum clearance shall be
three feet between any bicycles attached to a parking
device and the outside edge of the roadway and
shoulder.
3) Number. For residential uses, one bicycle parking
space is required for each dwelling unit; for all other
uses, one bicycle parking space is required for every
fifteen motor vehicle required parking spaces.
F. Design Incentives.
(1) Intent. Designs which incorporate one or more of the following
elements shall qualify for modifications of the design standards
as specified herein. These may include reductions in open
space dedication, increases in maximum lot size restrictions,
reductions in landscaping, and/or increases in permitted lot
coverage.
(2) Additional Workforce Housing. For each unit of workforce
housing provided in excess of the required 1:10 ratio, two
dwelling units may be placed on lots of between 15,000 and
20,000 square feet. To qualify, both the workforce housing and
the larger residential lots must be distributed in a manner that
permits their integration within the community.
(3) Rear Access. For every dwelling unit provided with rear access
and/or a garage which is not oriented to the street, one
required street tree may be eliminated. The total reduction
shall not be permitted to result in an average of less than one
tree for every 50 feet of road frontage.
(4) Passive Recreation Improvements. When an improvement to
passive recreational areas within the dedicated open space
and/or to public areas is provided, a 2% decrease in the
percentage of required open space will be considered.
Qualified improvements shall include fountains, benches, trail
surfacing, educational signage and/or additional landscaping.
§ 22-5B01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5B01
FWD:668
Each amenity provided will be considered separately; however,
this incentive shall have a maximum total reduction of 10% of
the required total.
(5) Vertical Mixed-Use Structures. For each vertical mixed-use
structure provided within the development, three dwelling
units may be placed on lots between 20,000 and 43,560 square
feet. This incentive is limited to allowing no more than 5% of
the total number of residential lots to be increased in this
manner. In addition, the larger residential lots must be
distributed in a manner that permits their integration within
the community.
(6) LID and BMP. For either the use of low impact development
techniques (LID) or the implementation of best management
practices (BMP) as specified in the Act 167 Watershed
Stormwater Management Plan and the use of pervious paving
for all surface parking provided within the development, the
maximum lot coverage permitted will be increased to 65%.
However, the maximum impervious coverage standard shall
not be increased above 85%.
(7) Natural Building Techniques. The use of natural building
techniques or materials for a minimum of 5% of the total
dwelling units shall permit an increase in maximum lot
coverage to 65%. However, the maximum impervious coverage
standard shall not be increased above 85%.
(8) Off-Street Pedestrian Improvements. Every improved trail,
greenway, or other off-street pedestrian way that connects
residential development to an open space element such as a
playground, conservation area, active recreation facility or a
civic or institutional use shall be qualified to receive a 2%
decrease in the percentage of open space required. Multiple
connections may be considered separately; however, this
incentive shall not permit an accumulated reduction in excess
of 10% of the total.
(9) Stormwater Management Amenities. Where stormwater
management facilities are designed as amenities to the
development and aesthetically enhance the open space
provided, a 5% reduction in the amount of required open space
will be considered. Such enhancements might include the
incorporation of walking paths, water features, and/or rain
gardens. Such features can be considered separately; however,
this incentive shall not permit an accumulated reduction in
excess of 15% of the total.
(10) Structured Parking. The maximum building square footage of
nonresidential units within structures can be doubled when all
parking associated with the use(s) is located either
§ 22-5B01 FOREWORD § 22-5B01
FWD:669
underground or in a parking structure designed to serve one
or more uses within a TTD. The maximum footprint of any
building approved shall, however, not exceed 30,000 square
feet. The maximum square footage for grocery stores may not

§ 22-5C01. General Regulations. [Ord. No. 1050, 11/18/2019]
1. Off-street parking and loading space shall be provided and maintained
for each use and structure hereafter established, erected, altered or
extended in accordance with the provisions of this section.
A. General Regulations.
(1) Use. All required off-street parking spaces shall be used solely
for the parking of motor vehicles by residents, visitors, patrons
or employees.
(2) Location.
(a) All required parking spaces shall be located on the same
lot as the use they serve, except that:
1) The owner of two or more abutting lots may locate the
use on one lot and the parking space required for the
use on another of his abutting lots.
2) Two or more abutting property owners may locate the
parking space required for their uses on any of their
lots if:
3) The lot(s) providing the parking space abuts the lot(s)
containing the use(s) it serves.
4) All of the affected lots are in the same zoning district.
5) Means of pedestrian access is provided from the
parking space to the uses so that pedestrians are not
required to traverse property owned by other than
said property owners, except where public sidewalks
may provide the access.
6) That a lease, easement or other form of agreement be
executed among said property owners assuring use of
the required parking spaces are located on the same
lot as the use they serve and recorded in the office for
the recording of deeds of Centre County.
(3) In all cases above, all parking shall be included in the
application for a zoning permit.
(a) All parking spaces and lots open to the sky (i.e., not in
garages or carports) shall be located no closer than two
feet from any property line, except for abutting property
lines of two or more lots exercising the options for
common parking stipulated in this section.
§ 22-5C01 FOREWORD § 22-5C01
FWD:671
(b) All covered parking spaces and lots, including garages and
carports, shall not be located within any yard setback area,
except when permitted as an accessory building.
(c) No parking lots open to the sky shall be permitted within
the front yard setback area, except in the General
Commercial (C) District.
(d) Parking of self-propelled motor vehicles (not including
recreational vehicles) is prohibited on the lawn or in yard
areas for all residential uses in all districts. This does not
include the incidental parking of vehicles for washing or
cleaning.
(4) Existing Facilities. Parking spaces and lots serving structures
and uses in existence at the date of the adoption of this chapter
shall not be subject to the requirements of this section as long
as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any
parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in
the future be reduced below such requirements, or, if already
below such requirements, be reduced further.
(5) Change in Requirements. Whenever there is an alteration or
extension of a use or structure which increases the parking
requirements according to Subsection B, below, the total
additional parking required for the alteration or extension shall
be provided in accordance with the requirements of that
subsection.
(6) Construction. All required off-street parking spaces and aisles
shall be paved with an all-weather material. For spaces and
aisles which are not part of a parking lot as herein defined, this
may include gravel or other crushed stone. However, for
parking lots, the paving material shall be limited to asphalt,
concrete or similar hard surface material with all parking
spaces designated with a four-inch contrasting stripe painted
the entire length of each space in accordance with the
dimensional requirements stipulated in Subsection B, below.
All required off-street parking spaces and aisles for private
recreational areas shall be constructed with six inches of
crushed and compacted stone. Private recreation areas shall
be exempt from such other construction regulations.
B. Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. All uses and structures shall
provide off-street parking spaces in an amount equal to, or greater
than, the number listed below. The total number of parking spaces
necessary for two or more uses on the same lot shall be the sum of
that required for each use unless a shared parking arrangement is
provided in accordance with the provisions of Subsection E. Shared
parking spaces that are accessible by neighboring properties or
§ 22-5C01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5C01

during the same daily time period.
(1) Dimensions. Each required off-street parking space shall be at
least nine feet wide and 18 feet long if set at an angle to the
access aisle or eight feet wide and 24 feet long if parallel to the
access aisle.
(2) Number of Computation. In computing the required number of
spaces, all fractional numbers more than 1/2 shall be increased
to the next highest integer. When computation is based on the
number of employees, the number employed during the largest
work shift shall be used. For retail and service parking
calculations the gross floor area is that portion of the total floor
area relegated to use by the customer and employees to
consummate retail sales and services, including display areas,
but not including office space and storage areas.

* The number of bedrooms used for this calculation is
the total number of bedrooms minus one (except for
one-bedroom apartments).
(b) Single-family detached and single-family semidetached
dwelling units constructed on individual lots may meet the
spillover parking requirements on their individual
driveways. When multiple buildings are developed on one
lot as unified development, the spillover parking
requirements shall be provided in separate parking areas.
Spillover parking space dimensions shall be:
9 feet by 18 feet, if provide off-street
23 feet by 8 feet, if provided as parallel parking on street
C. Parking Lots. For the purposes of this chapter, parking lots are
defined as facilities providing off-street parking space for five or
more motor vehicles. All parking lots shall meet the design and
maintenance standards specified below. All applications for a
§ 22-5C01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5C01
FWD:682
zoning permit to use land, in whole or in part, as a parking lot as
herein defined shall be accompanied by a land development plan as
stipulated in this chapter.
(1) Dimensions.
(a) All parking spaces shall comply with the dimensions
specified in this chapter. The minimum dimensions of all
aisles providing access to parking lot spaces shall be as
follows:
Angle of
Parking Space
to Aisle
(degrees)
Aisle Width
(feet)
One Way Two Way
Parallel 12 20
30° (150°) 12 20
45° (135°) 15 20
60° (120°) 18 20
90° 24 24
(b) No portion of any parking space shall intrude into the
required aisle width. For aisles providing access to parking
spaces set at angles other than those specified above, the
required aisle width shall be that of the nearest specified
angle of parking. If equidistant from specified angles, the
greatest aisle width of the two nearest angles shall apply.
(2) Obstructions. Parking lots shall be designed to permit each
motor vehicle to proceed to and from all unoccupied parking
spaces without requiring the moving of any other parked motor
vehicle.
(3) Ingress and Egress. Entrance and exit driveways and aisles
linking parking lots to public streets shall comply with the
standards for motor vehicle access. Parking spaces shall be
designed to prevent motor vehicles from backing onto a public
street in order to leave the lot.
D. Loading Regulations. Space for the loading and unloading of
vehicles shall be provided when required below. Each required
space shall be at least 12 feet in width, 45 feet in length and have a
vertical clearance of at least 14 feet. Spaces shall be located no
closer than 10 feet from a public right-of-way and five feet from any
other lot line and shall be paved with an all-weather material.
§ 22-5C01 FOREWORD § 22-5C01
FWD:683
(1) One off-street loading space is required for all nonresidential
uses with a floor area of at least 5,000 square feet but less than
20,000 square feet or more, one additional space shall be
provided for each additional 20,000 square feet or fraction
thereof.
(2) Required off-street parking spaces shall not be used for loading
and unloading purposes except during hours when business
operations are suspended.
(3) All required loading and unloading spaces shall be located on
the same property as the use they serve.
(4) The provisions of subsections above, pertaining to off-street
parking spaces, shall also pertain to all required off-street
loading and unloading spaces.
E. Provisions to Reduce Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. In an
effort to reduce impervious coverage, traffic congestion and allow
an increase in landscaped green space area and/or building size,
the following shall be considered:
(1) Shared parking spaces that are accessible by neighboring
properties or uses may be permitted when use of the spaces
does not occur during the same daily time period. The
applicant must provide justification showing calculations of the
peak parking use for the spaces that would have overlapping
users during their respective hours of operation. The hours of
operation must show that sufficient spaces would be available
for the shared parking purpose. As a result, the number of
parking spaces could be reduced no more than one half of the
total required for the particular use(s) participating in shared
parking. Should the use change in the future, and its
associated off-street parking, the parking must be provided as
required or shared additional parking be pursued.
(2) When increasing the passengers per vehicle to sites with high
employment would decrease parking demand, relief in the
required parking spaces may occur. The parking spaces may be
reduced by a factor of 25% if the applicant for land
development plan approval provides a transportation
management program to utilize one or a combination of the
following modes to reduce single occupant vehicles that is
based on substantiated projections of reduction in demand:
(a) Shared ride/carpooling.
(b) Van pooling.
(c) Subscription bus service(s); CATA bus.
§ 22-5C01 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5C01
FWD:684
(3) To qualify for the above, the applicant must provide evidence to
the approval of the Board of Supervisors that:
(a) The applicant shall establish an approved carpooling
program.
(b) Applicant will obtain or lease to qualified employees vans,
buses or the high passenger capacity vehicles, for the
purpose of providing transportation of additional
passengers (vanpooling).
(c) Applicant will operate or hire vans, buses or other high
passenger capacity vehicles to provide exclusive or
nonexclusive commuter transportation of employees from
residential areas other transit terminals, such as a park
and ride.
(d) Applicant shall contribute to the public bus service to add
routes, shelter, amenities or fare contribution that would
be generated by those employees to utilize the bus service.
(4) Additionally, programs to increase vanpooling and carpooling,
are examples that follow:
(a) Applicant will employ working day policy known as
"flextime" where employees are given some latitude on
starting and quitting times.
(b) Applicant will provide adequate lunch facilities on the site.
(c) Applicant will provide preferential parking.
(d) As a part of the request to reduce parking spaces, the
applicant shall show to the satisfaction of the Board of
Supervisors that the actions proposed shall reduce the
parking demand by the amount requested.
(5) Parking at Site Fronting Arterial and/or Highway Roads.
(a) At the option of the approval by the Board of Supervisors, a
reduction of off-street parking spaces may be considered
as follows that would pertain only to parking at the site
fronting arterial and/or highway roads:
1) The buffer yard in the front contains unique natural
features as determined by the Board of Supervisors
that may require an area to be wider than the
minimum front buffer.
2) The buffer yard in the front contains features that
contribute to the community character of the
Township as determined by the Board of Supervisors
§ 22-5C01 FOREWORD § 22-5C01
FWD:685
that may require an area to be wider than the
minimum front buffer.
3) The requirements of a corridor overlay zone that may
provide for a wider than minimum buffer.
4) Opportunities to preserve stands of existing trees
using creative landscaping designs would be helpful to
enhance the appearance of pedestrian areas, as well
as breaking up the monotony of a large lot.
(b) The Planning Commission may recommend, and the Board
of Supervisors may approve the reduction in off-street
parking spaces associated with increasing the front buffer
yard. The area removed from parking must be sufficient to
provide the required parking. The area removed from
parking may be returned to parking at a future date should
the operator of the use experience a parking shortage
based on demand after the use has been in operation for a
period exceeding two years. The requirement of land

until Ferguson Township finds that the applicable provisions of
this chapter have been complied with.
C. Existing Bicycle Parking Affected by Construction.
(1) In the event that Ferguson Township has authorized a permit
holder to remove existing bicycle parking in the public right-ofway
due to construction, the permit holder shall replace such
§ 22-5C02 FOREWORD § 22-5C02
FWD:689
bicycle parking no later than the date of completion of the
construction. At least seven days prior to removal of such
bicycle parking, the permit holder shall post, in the immediate
vicinity of the bicycle parking area, a weatherproof notice,
with a minimum type size of one inch, specifying the date
of removal. In the event that any bicycles remain parked on
the date of the removal, such bicycles shall be stored for a
reasonable period, not less than 45 days, and a conspicuous,
weatherproof notice shall be placed as close as feasible to the
site of the removed bicycle parking containing information as
to how to retrieve a removed bicycle.
(2) If bicycle parking is likely to be removed, pursuant to this
section, for more than 120 days, it shall, to the extent possible,
be temporarily re-sited, in coordination with the Township
Department of Planning and Zoning, to a location as close to
the original site as feasible, pending completion of the
construction. If the temporary site is not clearly visible from
the original site, the permit holder shall post a conspicuous,
weatherproof notice in the immediate vicinity of the original
site informing bicyclists of the location of the temporary site.
D. Bicycle Parking Standards - General.
(1) All bicycle parking spaces shall be:
(a) Well lit if accessible to the public or bicyclists after dark;
(b) Located to ensure significant visibility by the public and
building users, except in the case of long-term bicycle
parking that is located in secured areas; and
(c) Accessible without climbing more than one step or going
up or down a slope in excess of 12% and via a route on the
property that is designed to minimize conflicts with motor
vehicles and pedestrians.

in a parking facility shall be:
(a) Clearly marked; and
(b) Separated from motor vehicles by some form of physical
barrier (such as bollards, concrete or rubber curbing or
pads, reflective wands, a wall, or a combination thereof)
designed to adequately protect the safety of bicyclists and
bicycles.
(3) All bike racks shall be located at least 36 inches in all
directions from any obstruction, including but not limited to
other bike racks, walls, doors, posts, columns, or exterior or
interior landscaping.
§ 22-5C02 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5C02
FWD:690
(4) Unless bicycle parking spaces are clearly visible from an
entrance, a sign indicating their location shall be prominently
displayed outside the main entrance to the building or facility,
and additional signs shall be provided as necessary to ensure
easy way finding. A "Bicycle Parking" sign shall also be
displayed on or adjacent to any indoor room or area designated
for bicycle parking. All outdoor signs required by this section
shall be no smaller than 12 inches by 18 inches and utilize a
type size of at least two inches. All indoor signs required by
this section shall be no smaller than eight inches by 10 inches
and utilize a type size of at least 5/8 inch.
E. Additional Requirements Applicable to Short-Term Bicycle Parking
Only. All short-term bicycle parking spaces shall contain bike racks
and shall meet the following requirements, in addition to the
associated requirements above:
(1) Location.
(a) Short-term bicycle parking must be located either a)
within 50 feet of the main public entrance of the building
or facility, or b) no further than the nearest motor vehicle
parking space to the main public entrance (excluding
parking for individuals with disabilities), whichever is
closer. If the new development or major renovation
contains multiple buildings or facilities, the required shortterm
bicycle parking shall be distributed to maximize
convenience and use.
(b) Short-term bicycle parking spaces may be located either a)
on-site or b) in the public right-of-way (e.g., sidewalk or instreet
bicycle parking), provided that an encroachment
permit is obtained for the installation and the installation
meets all other requirements of encroachments on public
rights-of-way. If bike racks are located on public sidewalks,
they must provide at least five feet of pedestrian
clearance, and up to six feet where available, and be at
least two feet from the curb.
(2) Bike Rack Requirements.
(a) Bike racks used for short-term bicycle parking must be
securely attached to concrete footings, a concrete
sidewalk, or another comparably secure concrete surface,
and made to withstand severe weather and permanent
exposure to the elements.
F. Additional Requirements Applicable to Long-Term Bicycle Parking
Only. Long-term bicycle parking shall be provided in either 1) bike
lockers or 2) indoor rooms or areas specifically designated for
bicycle parking (including designated areas of an indoor parking

security measures (such as limiting access to a designated
indoor bike parking room to persons with a key, smart card, or
code) are optional.
G. Motor Vehicle Parking Space Credits.
(1) For every six bicycle parking spaces provided, the number of
required off-street motor vehicle parking spaces (excluding
parking spaces for individuals with disabilities) on a site shall
be reduced by one space.
(2) To encourage the installation of showers at nonresidential
sites, the number of required off-street motor vehicle parking
spaces for such sites shall be reduced as follows: A credit of
one space shall be provided for the first shower installed, with
additional off-street motor vehicle parking credits available at
a rate of one space for each additional shower provided per 25
required bicycle parking spaces. In order to claim these
credits, which shall be in addition to the bicycle parking credits
provided for in Subsection 1G(1), shower facilities must be
readily available for use by all employees of the new
development or major renovation.
2. Bicycle Parking Requirements for Parking Facilities.
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide sufficient safe
and convenient bicycle parking in parking facilities so as to
encourage bicycling as a form of transportation, which, in turn,
reduces traffic congestion, air pollution, wear and tear on roads,
and use of fossil fuels, while fostering healthy physical activity.
B. Licensing Conditions. As a condition of the issuance or renewal of a
license required by the Township for a parking facility, parking
facilities shall provide one bicycle parking space per each 20
vehicle parking spaces provided, with a minimum of six bicycle
parking spaces. Where the calculation of total required spaces
results in a fractional number, the next highest whole number shall
be used.
§ 22-5C02 FERGUSON CODE § 22-5C02
FWD:692
C. Location. All bicycle parking spaces required by this section shall
be located in an area, preferably on the ground floor, that i) can be
conveniently and safely accessed by bicycle and by foot in a way
that minimizes conflicts with motor vehicles, ii) is not isolated, and
iii) maximizes visibility by parking facility patrons and attendants.
If the licensed parking facility has multiple entrances, the required
bicycle parking spaces may be spread out among the multiple
entrances. Bicycle parking spaces shall be accessible without
climbing more than one step or going up or down a slope in excess
of 12%.
D. Bike Racks. All bicycle parking spaces required by this section shall
contain bike racks and shall be well lit if accessible to the public or
bicyclists after dark or if in an interior or darkened location. All
bike racks shall also provide a clearance of at least 36 inches in all
directions from any obstruction (including but not limited to other
bike racks, walls, doors, posts, columns or landscaping), and shall
be separated from vehicles by some form of physical barrier (such
as bollards, concrete or rubber curbing or pads, reflective wands, a
wall, or a combination thereof) designed to adequately protect the
safety of bicyclists and bicycles. All bike racks located outdoors
shall also be securely attached to concrete footings and made to
withstand severe weather and permanent exposure to the
elements.
E. Signage. Parking facilities shall also install prominent signs, no
smaller than 12 inches by 18 inches and utilizing a type size of at
least two inches, in or near each entrance that advertise the
availability of bicycle parking and the location, if it is not visible
from the entrance.
F. Contractual Limits on Liability. This section shall not interfere with
the rights of a parking facility owner (or designee) to enter into
agreements with facility users or take other lawful measures to
limit the parking facility's liability to users, including bicycle users,
with respect to parking in the parking facility, provided that such
agreements or measures are otherwise in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the law.
3. Bicycle Parking Requirements for Special Events Involving Street
Closures.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide sufficient safe
and convenient bicycle parking at special events involving street
closures to encourage bicycling as a form of transportation, which,
in turn, reduces traffic congestion, air pollution, wear and tear on
roads, and use of fossil fuels, while fostering healthy physical
activity.
B. Conditions on Street Closure Permits. As a condition of a permit for
the closure of a street for a special event in which the daily number
§ 22-5C02 FOREWORD § 22-5C02
FWD:693
of participants is projected to be 1,000 or more, monitored bicycle
parking shall be provided by the event sponsor (or a designee)
for at least 1% of expected daily participants beginning 1/2 hour
before and ending 1/2 hour after the time of the event each day of
the event.
C. Requirements for Monitored Parking. Monitored bicycle parking
shall include the presence, at all times, of one attendant, or more as
needed, to receive bicycles, dispense claim checks, return bicycles,
and provide security for all bicycles.
D. Location. All monitored bicycle parking shall be located within 500
feet of at least one regular entrance or access point to the event.
E. Publicity and Signage. All publicity, including signs, for the event
shall state the availability of monitored bicycle parking, its location,
and cost, if any. All event maps shall include the location of
monitored bicycle parking. If monitored bicycle parking is not
within eyeshot of each entrance, signs shall be provided to ensure
easy way finding.
F. Insurance Coverage and Fees. The event sponsor or designee must
provide insurance coverage for the monitored bicycle parking in
case of damaged or stolen bicycles and may charge users a fee to
cover the cost of providing the monitored parking.
4. Removal of Abandoned Bicycles.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure the reasonably
prompt removal of bicycles abandoned in bicycle parking spaces so
as to encourage bicycling as a form of transportation, which, in
turn, reduces traffic congestion, air pollution, wear and tear on
roads, and use of fossil fuels, while fostering healthy physical
activity.
B. Definitions. The definitions set forth in this chapter shall apply to
this section, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
C. Removal Requirements. On a quarterly basis, owners of property
(or a designee) subject to § 22-5C02 of this chapter shall remove,
from all bicycle parking spaces associated with their property,
including those located on the public right-of-way, bicycles that
have been abandoned. A bicycle shall be deemed to be abandoned
if it has not been removed after having been tagged with a notice of
removal for two weeks for short-term bicycle parking spaces or
four weeks for long-term bicycle parking spaces. However, a
bicycle shall not be deemed to be abandoned if the bicyclist and
property owner (or designee) have a written agreement regarding
provision of long-term storage covering the time period in question.
Abandoned bicycles may be donated to nonprofits that reuse
bicycles or may be disposed of in any lawful manner.

Map, except that the County Official Map shall govern as to county
streets and public grounds of the county in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Code.
D. Relationship with Adjacent Municipalities. If the Official Map, or
amendment thereto, shows any streets or public lands intended to
lead into any adjacent municipalities, a copy of said Official Map or
amendment shall be forwarded to such adjacent municipality. The
comments of the adjacent municipality shall be made to the Board
of Supervisors of Ferguson Township within 45 days of such
forwarding, and the proposed action by the Board of Supervisors
shall not be taken until such comments are received; provided,
however, that if the adjacent municipality fails to provide comments
within 45 days, the Board of Supervisors may proceed without the
comments of the adjacent municipality. Upon adoption of the
Official Map, or any amendment thereof, in which any street or
public lands are intended to lead into an adjacent municipality, a
certified copy of the Map and ordinance adopting it shall be
forwarded within 30 days after adoption to the adjacent
municipality.
1. Construction Within Mapped Streets, Watercourses or Public Grounds.
For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the Official Map of the
Township, no permit shall be issued for any building within the lines of
any street, watercourse or public ground shown or laid out on the
Official Map. No person shall recover any damages for the taking for
public use of building or improvements constructed within the lines of
any street, any watercourse or public ground after the same shall have
been included in the Official Map, and any such building or
improvement shall be removed at the expense of the owner. However,
when the property of which the reserved location forms a part cannot
yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a permit shall be granted,

permit or approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:

such current landowner had actual or constructive knowledge of
the violation.
D. The vendee or lessee of the current landowner of record who

regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or

estate broker, which property was transferred to him within the

the transfer.
2. Where there is a transfer by a builder or residential property which was
transferred to the builder within the preceding year as consideration
for the purchase of new, previously unoccupied residential property, a

§ 24-306. Collection Through Employers. [Ord. 893, 11/19/2007,
§ 1]
1. The tax levied by § 24-304 shall not be imposed upon the following
persons:
A. Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the
United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans Administration or its
successor to be a total 100% permanent disability.
B. Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
calendar year. For purposes of this subsection, "reserve component
of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army Reserve,
United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve,
United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force
Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
C. Any person whose total earned income and/or net profits from all
sources within the municipality is less than $12,000 for the
calendar year in which the local services tax is levied.
1. Every employer shall, within 15 days after first becoming an employer,
register with the collector the employer's name, address and such other
information as the collector may require. Failure to register in a timely
manner does not relieve the employer of the requirements of this Part.
2. As to each taxpayer employed for any length of time during any payroll
period of an employer during the calendar year, each employer shall
deduct a pro rata share of the tax from the earned income payable to
the taxpayer with respect to such payroll period. The pro rata share of
the tax assessed on a Taxpayer for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax ($52) levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar
year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share of the tax, an
employer shall round down the amount of tax deducted for each payroll
period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar.
3. Each employer shall file a return on a form prescribed by the collector,
and pay the collector the full amount of all such taxes deducted during a
§ 24-304 FOREWORD § 24-306
FWD:723
calendar quarter within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter.
A tax return must be filed for each calendar quarter, regardless of
whether withholdings were completed or any tax liability exists.
4. Any employer who discontinues business or ceases operation during the
calendar year, shall within 15 days after discontinuing business or
ceasing operation, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax
to the collector.
5. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this subsection, or who fails to
pay such tax to the collector, shall be liable for such tax in full, as
though the tax had originally been levied against such employer. No
employer shall be liable for failure to deduct the tax if the failure to
deduct the tax arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed.
6. Priority of Withholding. The tax shall be withheld at the place of
employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax
during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more
than one occupation, i.e., concurrent employment, or an occupation
which requires the person working in more than one political
subdivision during the payroll period, the priority to withhold the local
services tax shall be in the following order:
A. The political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
B. The political subdivision in which the person resides and works, if
the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
C. The political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
7. The employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate
records concerning the employees in the cases described in Subsection
7A and B of this section.
A. It is the intent of this subsection that no person shall be subject to
the payment of the local services tax in more than one municipality
during each payroll period. No taxpayer shall be required to pay
more than $52 in total during the calendar year. In the case of
concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax, if the employee provides:
(1) A recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes
the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and
the amount of local services tax withheld.
§ 24-306 FERGUSON CODE § 24-306
FWD:724
(2) A statement from the employee that the pay statement is from
the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify
other employers of a change in principal place of employment
within two weeks of its occurrence.
B. In the case of an employee claiming the exemption set forth at
§ 24-305, Subsection 1C, if (1) the employee has provided an
exemption certificate to the employer, (2) the collector has not
otherwise instructed the employer, (3) the employer has not
received notification from the person who claimed the exemption or
from the collector that the person has received earned income and/
or net profits from all sources within the municipality equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year,
and (4) the employer has not paid to the person earned income
within the municipality an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000
in that calendar year.
C. If a person has claimed exemption from the tax under § 24-305,
Subsection 1C, for a given calendar year but either (1) the
employer has received notification from the person who claimed
the exemption or from the collector that the person has received
earned income and/or net profits from all sources within the
municipality equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year
or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for
that calendar year, or (2) the employer has paid to the person
earned income within the municipality an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, then the employer shall
withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year and the
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period
after receipt of the notification described in paragraph .A(1) above
or for the first payroll period after payments described in
paragraph .A(2) above have been made, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person, plus the per payroll amount due
for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld per payroll
period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall
be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the event the
employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
paragraph is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the
person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and
the collector may pursue collection under this Part.
D. Each employer shall ensure that exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with an exemption certificate form at the time of
hiring and prior to the first pay period of each calendar year.
E. A person seeking exemption from the tax under § 24-305,
Subsection 1C, must annually file an exemption certificate with the
employer and the collector.

Every taxpayer who is self-employed and has not filed an exemption
certification with the collector, or whose tax for any other reason is not
collected under § 24-306 of this Part, shall file a return on a form prescribed
by the collector and shall pay a pro rata share of the tax directly to the
collector within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The pro
rata share of the tax assessed on a taxpayer for a calendar quarter shall be
determined by dividing the rate of the tax levied ($52) for the calendar year
by four.
§ 24-308. Nonresident Taxpayers. [Ord. 893, 11/19/2007, § 1]
Both resident and nonresident taxpayers shall, by virtue of engaging in an
occupation within the municipality, be subject to the tax and the provisions
of this Part.

taxes, interest, fines and penalties imposed by this Part, and shall maintain
records showing interest, fines and penalties imposed by this Part, and
shall maintain records showing the amounts received and the dates such
amounts were received. The collector shall prescribe and issue all forms
necessary for the administration of the tax and shall enforce regulations
adopted by the governing body relating to any matter pertaining to the
administration of this Part, including, but not limited to, requirements for
collection through employers, requirements for evidence and records, and
provisions for the examination and correction of returns. The collector
and any designated agents may examine the records of any employer or
supposed employer or of any taxpayer or supposed taxpayer in order to
ascertain the tax due or verify the accuracy of any return. Every employer
or supposed employer and every taxpayer or supposed taxpayer shall give
the collector and any designated agent all means, facilities and opportunity
for the examinations hereby authorized. Any such examination shall be
conducted within this municipality or at the office where the tax return is
processed.
§ 24-310. Suits for Collection of Tax. [Ord. 893, 11/19/2007, § 1]
The municipality or its collector of the tax may collect unpaid taxes from the
taxpayer or employer owing such taxes by suit as provided for by Act 511 of
1965, as amended, known as the "Local Enabling Tax Act."
F. Each employer within the municipality and each employer located
outside the municipality who engages in business within the
municipality is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax
from each of the employees engaged by the employer and
performing work for the employer within the municipality.

1. The tax levied pursuant to this Part shall be due and payable on the date
on which the taxpayer is required to file a return, as set forth
hereinbefore, and, if the same is not paid on that date, a penalty of 10%
shall be added there, plus interest at the rate of 0.5% per month of the
unpaid tax for each month or fraction thereof during which the tax
remains unpaid.
2. The failure of a taxpayer to receive a tax return does not relieve their
filing or payment responsibility.
3. The penalties imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed by any other section in this Part.
1. Any taxpayer or employer who fails, neglects, or refuses to make a
return required, any employer who fails, neglects or refuses to register
or to pay the tax deducted from employees, or fails, neglects, or refuses
to deduct or withhold the tax from employees, taxpayer or employer
who refuses to permit the collector to examine the books, records, and
papers, and taxpayer or employer who knowingly makes any
incomplete, false or fraudulent return or attempts to do anything
whatsoever to avoid the full disclosure of the amount of tax due in order

upon conviction thereof before the district magistrate be sentenced to
pay a fine of not more than $500 for each offense, and costs, and, in
default of said fines and costs be imprisoned for a period not exceeding
30 days.
2. The failure of taxpayer or employer to receive or procure forms
required for filing the required return does not excuse the taxpayer or
employer from the filing requirement.
1. Any person who has overpaid the tax may obtain a refund by making a
written application for a refund to the collector no later than one
calendar year after payment of the tax or three years after the due date

§ 25-101. Purpose. [Ord. 991, 8/18/2014, § 1.00]
§ 25-102. Definitions. [Ord. 991, 8/18/2014, § 2.00]
For the purpose of this Part, the following definitions shall have the
following meanings:
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS  The elected governing body of Ferguson
Township.
CANOPY  The upper portion of a tree's limbs, branches and leaves.
COMMISSION  The Tree Commission of Ferguson Township.
HAZARDOUS TREE  A tree determined by a qualified arborist or Public
Works Director to constitute a threat to the health and/or structure of other
trees and/or a risk to property damage or personal injury. This could include
trees that have been assessed as having improbable, possible, probable or
imminent risk ratings.
NOTICE  Either publication in a newspaper of general circulation once a
week for two consecutive weeks, or written notification sent by first class
mail to property owners immediately affected, or notification posted on
the affected tree. Notice of public hearings shall be published and sent to
affected property owners within 30 calendar days of the hearing date.
PARK TREE  Any tree located in a park controlled by the Township or its
designated agent.
1. The Ferguson Township street and park tree ordinance acknowledges
the urban forest as a necessary part of Township infrastructure. It
states trees and green space are equal with other Township
infrastructure and services as important components of the health,
safety and welfare of residents and visitors. This green infrastructure
provides numerous benefits to the Township including environmental
(carbon storage, increased biodiversity and air pollution mitigation,
climate modification and stormwater mitigation); social (improved
human health and quality of life); and economic (increased property
values and business and decreased energy use). The failure to properly
replace and maintain our urban forest reduces its ability to provide
these important ecosystem processes and services. This Part addresses
the management, maintenance and enforcement policy necessary for a
healthy urban forest. As the Township improves the health of the urban
forest, human health and safety, quality of life and the Township as a
whole are improved. Thus, the purposes of this Part are:
A. To protect public health, safety and welfare by providing for
efficient and effective street and park tree management and
maintenance. To protect and enhance our plant, air, soil and water
resources and the ecosystem processes and services they provide.

area of the tree which was unlawfully cut, broken, destroyed or
removed. In all instances of replacement pursuant to this
subsection, such replacement trees shall be sufficient to replace
the total cross-sectional area as measured at diameter at breast
height (DBH) of the tree removed. For example, for every six-inch
diameter tree removed, it shall be replaced with one six-inch tree,
or four three inch trees or nine two-inch trees, all in a manner
satisfactory to and in locations approved by the Department of
Public Works. It shall be a violation of this Part for any person to fail
to replant any tree when, as, and if directed by the Department of
Public Works to do so. For purposes of this Part, the word similar
shall mean and include a tree that has a minimum diameter of two
inches or more and is approved by the Department of Public Works.

cutting, debarking, breaking, pruning of roots over two inches,
pruning for lights or views, by the use of herbicides, use of a vehicle
or in any other manner wherein it is determined by that such
damage or destruction was intentionally inflicted, such person
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a summary offense and shall be
subject to a fine of not less than $1,000 for each violation as well as
the cost of repairing or replacing each damaged tree shall be
levied. The value of tree(s) to be repaired or replaced shall be
determined by an International Society of Arboriculture Certified
Arborist using a valuation method approved by the Council of Tree
and Landscape Appraisers, said appraisal shall be paid for by the
property owner, contractor or other person who injured or killed a
living tree in any public area and said appraisal shall be provided to
the Township.
3. Interference with Township Departments. No person shall prevent,
delay, harass or interfere with the Department of Public Works or any
other Township department, or any of their agents or employees,
including any employees of the Department of Public Works in the

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 26-301. General Requirements. [Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
1. All regulated activities in the Township which do not fall under the
exemption criteria shown in § 26-110 of this chapter shall submit a
stormwater management site plan to the Township for review. This plan
must be consistent with the Spring Creek Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan. These criteria shall apply to the total proposed
development even if development is to take place in phases. Impervious
cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway
areas, and any new streets and sidewalks. Any areas designed to
initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be impervious
for the purposes of comparison to the waiver criteria. The DEP
Stormwater BMP Manual, as amended and updated, shall be used for
design of stormwater management facilities. No disturbance may be
performed prior to approval of a stormwater management site plan. All
activities (especially earth disturbance activities) must comply with this
chapter, Title 25 of the Pa. Code and the Clean Streams Law.63
2. Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
A. Stormwater management facilities and related installations also
shall be provided:
(1) To ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the
curbline of streets.
(2) To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area drained,
and to prevent substantial flow of water across intersections or
flooded intersections during storms, in accordance with the
procedures contained in Design Manual Part 2 (DM-2),
Chapter 10, of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PADOT).
(3) To ensure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under
driveways in, near, or across natural watercourses or drainage
swales. Suitable pipes or other waterways shall be provided as
necessary.
(4) To properly drain stormwater runoff from all land development
projects, except as required by recharge criteria. All lot and
open areas shall be designed to drain to the nearest practical
street or drainage system, existing or proposed, as defined by
63.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 26-301 FOREWORD § 26-301
FWD:763
the Township Engineer, with no impact on adjoining properties,
unless an area specifically designed for stormwater detention
is provided.
3. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the altered
property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable discharge
criteria specified in this chapter.
4. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge. If, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, the approved
analysis identifies there will be an impact on the downstream adjacent
property, the Township may require that the developer obtain a
stormwater easement. Where a development site is traversed by
watercourses or significant drainageways, drainage easements shall be
provided conforming to the line of such watercourses or significant
drainageways. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement.
Developers are encouraged to allow stormwater easements to revert to
a natural condition. Mowing or similar types of vegetative control are
discouraged while removal of invasive species are encouraged.
5. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PADEP through the joint permit
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PADEP, through
the general permit process.
6. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth (any
and all rivers, streams, creeks, rivulets, ditches, watercourses, storm
sewers, lakes, dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs, and all other
bodies or channels of conveyance of surface and underground water, or
parts thereof, whether natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries
of this commonwealth) or wetlands shall be subject to approval by
PADEP through the joint permit application process, or, where deemed
appropriate by PADEP, the general permit process. When there is a
question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the responsibility of
the developer or his agent to show that the land in question cannot be
§ 26-301 FERGUSON CODE § 26-301
FWD:764
classified as wetlands, otherwise approval to work in the area must be
obtained from PADEP.
7. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would discharge to or be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PADOT).
8. Low-impact development (LID) is to be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of
runoff through seepage beds, recharge trenches, etc., are encouraged,
where soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need
for detention facilities.
9. To promote over-land flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater,
roof drains should not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers, or roadside ditches unless approved by the Township Engineer
on a case-by-case basis.
10. Where deemed necessary by the Township Engineer, the applicant shall
submit an analysis of the impacts of detained stormwater flows on
downstream areas within the watershed. These impacts shall be
identified with concurrence from the Township Engineer. The analysis
shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to
determine the impact peak discharge modifications from the proposed
development have on critical locations such as dams, tributaries,
existing developments, undersized culverts, floodprone areas, etc. The
analysis shall include the impact of the modified quantity of discharged
water to developed downstream areas that experience flooding. The
applicant must demonstrate that the additional flow does not adversely
impact downstream properties or structures and the limits of said
flooded area are not increased by the proposed activity. ANY
REGULATED ACTIVITY THAT ADVERSELY IMPACTS DOWNSTREAM
PROPERTIES, STRUCTURES, PUBLIC FACILITIES, THREATENS THE
PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY SHALL BE PROHIBITED BY THE
TOWNSHIP.
11. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the analysis of downstream impacts shall
be submitted to the downstream municipality's engineer for review and
comment concurrent with the Township review. Proof of written
notification from the applicant to the downstream municipality's
engineer shall be provided with the submission.
12. When stormwater flows onto an adjacent property may be altered, proof
of written notification from the developer to the adjacent property
owner shall be provided. The notification shall be mailed by certified
mail, return receipt, to document delivery of the notification. The
notification shall advise the adjacent property owner of the specific
proposal and provide appropriate contact information for the
developer's engineer and Township Engineer.

§ 26-302. Water Quality Sensitive Area Districts and Developments.
[Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
13. Approved stormwater management site plans must be on site at all
times during construction.
14. Use of alternate and/or new stormwater management controls will be
considered by the Township. A description of the proposed alternate
controls must be submitted to the Township, the Centre County
Conservation District, and to DEP. The Township will coordinate any
approvals with the CCCD and/or DEP.
15. The stormwater management site plan must contain a proper long-term
ownership, operation and maintenance plan in accordance with Part 7
of this chapter.
16. No habitable structure shall be built within 50 feet of the one-hundredyear
floodplain. All floors of any living space shall be at least one foot
above the one-hundred-year floodplain water surface elevation. Any
access including doors, windows, openings to an uninhabited basement
or floor shall be at least one foot above the one-hundred-year floodplain
water surface elevation. Plans shall clearly state if the basement or
lowest floor is habitable.
17. Landscaping and grading of lots shall provide positive drainage away
from all structures.
1. Water Quality Sensitive Area Districts (Sensitive Area Districts) and
Water Quality Sensitive Developments (Sensitive Developments) have
been identified which require special consideration with regard to
stormwater management.
A. Water quality sensitive area districts are defined as those areas
that, if developed, have the potential to cause catastrophic loss to a
Water Authority well field. These areas consist of all Zone 2
wellhead protection areas defined by DEP within Township
boundaries (see Appendix B, Exhibit 1).64 The Township may
update the Sensitive Area District boundaries based on new
research or studies as required.
B. Water quality sensitive (WQS) developments (sensitive
developments) are defined as a land development project that has a
high potential to cause loss to local water quality, and could
potentially threaten groundwater reservoirs as determined by the
Township. Water quality sensitive developments include, but are
not limited to:
Vehicle fueling stations
Industrial manufacturing sites*

FWD:766
§ 26-303. Performance Standards. [Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
Salvage yards
Recycling centers
Hazardous material storage areas*
Interstate highways
* The Township Engineer will determine if a development is a
Sensitive Development on a case-by-case basis. The
Pennsylvania DEP wellhead protection contaminant source
list shall be used as a guide in these determinations.
Industrial manufacturing site and hazardous material storage
areas must provide NPDES SIC codes.
2. In Sensitive Area Districts and Developments, the capture volume shall
be managed in a stormwater facility separate from the peak rate control
facility. Peak rate control facilities in sensitive areas and developments
shall be lined with an impervious liner. For sites less than two acres in
size, or in cases where BMPs are limited to a total depth of 24 inches,
separate peak rate control and capture volume facilities are not
required. In addition, the developer of any project located within a
defined Zone II wellhead protection area, as defined by PADEP, and/or
the owner of a public water supply shall invite the governing body of the
water provider (or appointed representative) to a preapplication
meeting at the conceptual design stage to solicit input relative to
providing appropriate protection for the associated groundwater
resource.
1. General. Postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified.
2. Sensitive Area District Boundaries. The location of sensitive areas or
sensitive area districts (SAD) within the watershed are illustrated on a
map included as Exhibit 1 in Appendix B65 of this chapter.
3. Sites Located in More Than One District. For a proposed development
site which is traversed by a SAD boundary, the design criteria for
sensitive areas must be applied if postdevelopment runoff is directed
towards the sensitive area.
4. Off-Site Areas. Off-site areas that drain from sensitive areas through a
proposed development site that is located entirely in a nonsensitive
area are not required to use or apply the sensitive area criteria.
5. Site Areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area shall be subject to the design criteria.

§ 26-304. Calculation Methodologies. [Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
6. Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis. Any downstream or off-site
hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with these
standards shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment runoff associated with a two-year return
period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP, Chapter 105, regulations (if applicable) and,
at a minimum, pass the postdevelopment twenty-five-year return
period runoff.
D. It must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel,
other stormwater facilities, roadways, or overland areas are
capable of safely conveying the one-hundred-year design storm
without causing damage to buildings or other infrastructure.
E. Where the downstream conveyance channel or other facility is
located within a special flood hazard area as documented on the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal
Insurance Administration Flood Hazard Boundary Maps for
Ferguson Township, it must be demonstrated that the limits of said
flood hazard area are not increased by the proposed activity.
F. Stormwater management ponds that fall under the DEP Chapter
105 criteria of a "dam" must meet the criteria within Chapter 105.
1. Design criteria and calculation methodologies have been classified by
functional group for presentation as follows: 1) peak runoff rate
discharge requirements; 2) stormwater pond capture volumes; 3)
recharge volumes; 4) storm drain design including conveyance, channel
protection, and stability; 5) water quality standards; and 6) infiltration
test requirements.
2. These criteria and calculation methodologies have been developed to
simplify stormwater management designs, unify methods, remove
model parameter subjectivity, remove improperly used methods, and to
ensure that stormwater management decisions are based more
realistically on hydrologic processes. In addition, common sense should
always be used as a controlling criteria.
§ 26-303 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:768
3. These standards provide consistent and process-oriented design
procedures for application by land development professionals. It is
recognized that in an attempt to generalize the computational
procedures, assumptions have been made which on some occasions
may be violated. If such a violation is identified, alternate standards and
procedures may be applied. Both the violation and the alternate
procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist or
hydrogeologist. Any request for use of alternate standards or
procedures under this provision must be agreed to by the Township
Engineer prior to formal submission of plans for consideration by the
Township.
A. Peak Runoff Rate Control.
(1) Exemptions.
(a) Any site where the increase in postdevelopment peak
runoff rates is determined to be negligible by the Township
Engineer is exempt from the requirement to provide
stormwater detention. In support of this exemption, it
must be shown that the downstream conveyance systems
have adequate capacity to convey the additional discharge
without adversely affecting downstream properties. This
does not exempt the requirement for implementation of
designs for water quality, stormwater conveyance, and/or
recharge as required. A stormwater management site plan
and report documenting these design elements is also
required. The Township Engineer shall use a five-percent
increase as a general benchmark for defining "negligible."
The final definition of negligible shall be at the Township
Engineer's discretion. Prior to using this exemption (and
prior to any land development plan submission), the
design engineer must provide written documentation and
computations as to why no peak runoff control should be
required. The Township Engineer has the right to reject
any plan that uses this assumption without prior approval
of the Township Engineer. The intent of this exemption is
to eliminate the need for multiple or "piggyback" detention
facilities as a result of minor changes in imperviousness or
land use upstream of existing stormwater control facilities.
(b) Small sites (less than one acre) located directly adjacent to
the main stem of creeks, or within the floodplain, are not
required to provide stormwater detention unless directed
to do so by the Township Engineer as a result of a
documented drainage problem. All other stormwater
management standards must be implemented including
water quality, adequate stormwater conveyance, and/or
recharge as required. The Township Engineer has the
right to reject any plan that uses this exemption without
prior approval of the Township Engineer.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:769
(2) Stormwater management analysis must be performed using
the following models. The size criteria are based on drainage
area size including site area and all off-site area draining
across the development.
Drainage Area Size
(acres)
Model
Up to 100 NRCS's TR-55 or TR-20
Over 100 NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-1 (HECHMS)
(a) The Modified Rational Method using the Gert Aron Curves
may be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in
size without prior authorization from the Township
Engineer. The Modified Rational Method may also be used
for sites between two acres and five acres in size where
the Township Engineer has approved the method's use. In
this case the design engineer must make a written request
to the Township Engineer explaining why the use of the
Modified Rational Method is more appropriate than the
NRCS's (Natural Resource Conservation Service) methods
for the site in question. The design engineer should keep in
mind that the Modified Rational Formula methodology was
not calibrated to account for the karst nature of the Spring
Creek Drainage Basin; and, therefore, its use should be
limited to the special cases identified above. In addition,
since the minimum discharge criteria are based on a
calibration of the NRCS runoff model, their use is not
appropriate if the Modified Rational Method is used for
runoff computations.
(b) The Township Engineer has the right to reject any
stormwater management design that uses hydrograph
combinations with the Modified Rational Method where
the designer has not validated that the effects of the timing
differences are negligible. In addition, the Township
Engineer has the right to reject any stormwater
management design that improperly uses the method for
determining runoff volumes or does not properly apply the
method.
(c) More intensive physically based models may be used at the
discretion of the Township Engineer, but only for sites
greater than 100 acres in size.
(d) Commercial software packages that use the basic
computational methods of TR-55 or TR-20 are permitted.
(e) The NRCS models and methods recommended above are
based on data collected from actual watersheds. In
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:770
contrast to this, stormwater management analysis for land
development activities is often conducted using property
lines to define drainage boundaries. Drainage areas based
on property boundaries are not true watersheds and are
referred to here as "hypothetical" drainage areas. It is
known that these hypothetical drainage areas do not
respond like natural watersheds. Peak runoff rates from
hypothetical drainage areas are much smaller than
comparable runoff rates from natural watersheds of the
same size. Therefore, wherever possible, pre- and
postdevelopment stormwater analysis should be
conducted for watersheds that are as nearly natural as
possible. Also, conducting stormwater analysis for a lot by
lot comparison, such as within residential developments
is not permitted. Partitioning drainage areas into different
subwatersheds for the postdevelopment scenarios is
acceptable.
(f) It is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not
be used where the relative size of the watershed compared
to the site size would inappropriately distort the pre- to
postdevelopment runoff comparison. In these cases a
hypothetical drainage area defined by the property
boundary should be used because it will allow for a better
estimate of runoff changes directly downstream of the site.
In addition, the designer should recognize that, within the
Spring Creek Watershed, typical hypothetical drainage
areas, in their predevelopment or natural condition, do not
produce surface runoff during minor to moderate rainfall
events. Available hydrologic models do not accurately
reflect this condition. This often results in
postdevelopment nuisance flooding since the models
overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude.
(3) Major natural drainage divides may not be altered without the
prior consent of the Township Engineer.
(4) Pre- and postdevelopment stormwater management analysis
shall be conducted using the following design storms: one-year,
two-year, ten-year, one-hundred-year.
(5) The twenty-four-hour precipitation depths as obtained from
NOAA Atlas 14 shall be used for stormwater management
analysis for all of Ferguson Township. PennDOT IDF curves
may be used only if required by PennDOT.
(6) The NRCS's Type II precipitation distribution is required for all
stormwater management analyses.
(7) The NRCS's dimensionless unit hydrograph "k" factor shall be
484 for both pre- and postdevelopment stormwater analyses.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:771
(8) All undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods
in good hydrologic condition. Existing impervious areas may be
modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions.
The Township may require a maximum of 20% of the existing
impervious be modeled as meadow in areas where there are
known existing stormwater concerns downstream of the
project area or where the site being developed has either
deficient or nonexisting stormwater management facilities.
Developers of sites with existing impervious are highly
encouraged to set up a meeting with the Township prior to
design so that any additional requirements are identified prior
to plan submission.
(9) The NRCS's curve number (CN) shall be used as the rainfall to
runoff transformation parameter for all stormwater
management analyses.
(10) Curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in
prepackaged hydrologic models. It should be recognized that
the CN is only a design tool with a large degree of statistical
variability. For large sites, CNs should realistically be rounded
to the nearest whole number.
(11) The NRCS's method to determine unconnected impervious
area adjustments for CN may be used for distinctly defined
impervious land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a
dispersed manner. The method may only be used to calculate
runoff from site impervious areas that actually flow across
pervious areas. The method cannot be applied to the entire site
using average weighted CN values.
(12) Soils underlain by carbonate geology (limestone or dolomite)
shall have a hydrologic soil group (HSG) B used for both preand
postdevelopment conditions regardless of the NRCS or
Centre County Soil Survey's description, except for the
following two conditions:
(a) With the exception of minimally disturbed areas, the HSG
for all disturbed pervious areas shall be reduced by a
minimum of 1 HSG level to reflect an increase in runoff
associated with the loss of natural soil structure. No
reduction in postconstruction HSG level is required in
areas where soil restoration techniques are applied.
Acceptable soil restoration techniques include those
defined in the current version of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
techniques may be accepted if approved by the Township
Engineer.
(b) Soils identified as "on floodplains" or "on terraces above
floodplains" in the Centre County Soil Survey will use the
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:772
HSG as designated in the Soil Survey. Refer to Appendix
A66 for a list of the soils.
(13) Soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the HSG as
specified by the NRCS or Centre County Soil Survey's
description, except for the following two conditions:
(a) Wooded areas on HSG C and D soils shall be treated as
HSG B for predevelopment conditions. Disturbed
postdevelopment wooded areas shall carry the NRCS or
Centre County Soil Survey's defined HSG with a minimum
HSG of B.
(b) Highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum
of HSG C for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the
NRCS or Centre County Soil Survey's description. For
most developments these areas are normally covered with
impervious surfaces, but may include islands within
parking areas, fringe land, etc. A HSG of C shall also be
used for large projects that clear and grade land for later
phases of development. The Township Engineer shall make
the final determination as to what areas of a land
development site constitute compacted structural fill. The
intent is to account for large compacted areas, and not
minor grading within lawn areas or small areas around
buildings, etc.
(14) Areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by
removing the storage volume from the predevelopment
condition. The designer may assume that infiltration in the
closed depression does not occur during a design runoff event.
Areas draining to closed depressions may also be used to
adjust peak runoff rates to stormwater management ponds for
the postdevelopment analysis. This allowance has been
developed to entice designers to intentionally design or leave
in place small closed depressions that can reduce the total
volume required from a stormwater management pond. The
site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts
if the closed depression were removed.
(15) Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from
the modeled point-of-interest drainage areas defining
predevelopment peak flows. Assumptions that sinkholes
spillover during some storm events must be supported by
acceptable documentation as determined by the Township
Engineer. In addition, the design professional must be aware
that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will frequently result in
downstream flooding and should not be done if existing
downstream flooding already occurs. The site designer is
66.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:773
responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole
were to stop taking stormwater runoff.
(16) Ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by
the methods established in the NRCS's TR-55 Manual (1986).
However, more rigorous documented methods are acceptable
as determined by the Township Engineer.
(17) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously
AMC II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes. In addition, prior to any
continuous simulation model being used in the Spring Creek
Basin for any other purposes, the model unit hydrograph must
be modified for common events in additional to extreme events
based on an in-depth analysis of historical data from the basin.
(18) Time of Concentration.
(a) The following time of concentration (Tc) computational
methodologies shall be used unless another method is
preapproved by the Township Engineer:
1) Predevelopment: NRCS's Lag Equation.
2) Postdevelopment; commercial, industrial, or other
areas with large impervious areas (greater than 20%
impervious area): NRCS's Segmental Method.
3) Postdevelopment; residential, cluster, or other lowimpact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious
area: NCRS's Lag Equation.
(b) The time of concentration is to represent the average
condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of the
area. For example, large impervious areas bordered by
small pervious areas may not consider the effect of the
pervious areas in the Tc computation. If the designer
wants to consider the effect of the pervious area, runoff
from the pervious and impervious areas must be computed
separately with the hydrographs being combined to
determine the total runoff from the area.
(c) Under no circumstance will the postdevelopment Tc be
greater than the predevelopment Tc for any watershed or
subwatershed modeling purposes. This includes when the
designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow
velocities. In the event that the designer believes that the
postdevelopment Tc is greater, it will still be set by default
equal to the predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:774
1) Refer to Subsection 3A(28) regarding impervious area
flashing (IAF).
(19) Postdevelopment Minimum Discharges.
(a) The following postdevelopment minimum discharges are
permitted for use with the NRCS (CN) runoff model*:
Return Period Minimum Discharge
1-year Qpmin = 0.018 (DA) + 0.2
2-year Qpmin = 0.03 (DA) + 0.4
10-year Qpmin = 0.09 (DA) + 1.0
Where:
DA = the drainage area in
acres
Qpmin = minimum allowable
peak runoff rate in cfs
(b) For return periods greater than 10 years, the minimum
discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment
peak runoff rate.
(c) The minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate
for use with the Modified Rational Method. This is because
these values were developed based on NRCS model
corrections and do not actually represent a true physical
process or discharge. However, common sense should be
used by both the designer and reviewer in the evaluation
of acceptable minimum discharges for use with the
Modified Rational Method.
(d) The intent of the minimum discharge is to allow
reasonable runoff release from a site when a hydrologic
model has produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to
zero. The method is not permitted for areas that previously
drained completely to sinkholes in order to bypass the
sinkhole after development.
(e) These minimum discharge values include the total of all
stormwater management facilities discharges and
undetained area discharges. Peak runoff rates for
undetained fringe areas (where the designer has made a
realistic effort to control all new impervious areas) will be
computed using the predevelopment time of concentration
for the drainage areas tributary to them. Undetained areas
are those portions of the site that cannot be routed to a
stormwater management facility due to topography and
typically include lower pond berms, or small areas around
entrance drives. The site drainage areas used shall
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:775
represent the predevelopment condition, even if drainage
areas are altered following development.
(20) All lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and
noncarbonate areas must be considered impervious and may
not be used as pervious areas for stormwater management
computations. "Lined" here means lined with synthetic liners
or Bentonite. All other compacted soil liners will be considered
to be HSG D for hydrologic computations.
(21) Stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for
the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a
negligible discharge from these structures during design event
routing. Only discharges from the primary principal spillway or
emergency spillway need to be considered. Discharges from
subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not
be considered during design event routing. All subsurface
drains are to be equipped with a restrictor plate with a oneinch
opening in order to prevent the subsurface drain from
functioning as a primary orifice. A restrictor plate orifice may
be increased if necessary to the smallest size required to drain
the facility within the required 72 hours.
(22) Stormwater management ponds that have a pond capture,
recharge, or water quality component shall assume that the
basin is full to the controlling component volume at the
beginning of design event routing.
(23) Stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of
the one-hundred-year return period peak runoff rate assuming
that all of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged, and
the principal spillway overflow is 50% clogged. A minimum of a
six-inch freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting
maximum water surface elevations (W.S.E.). Any embankment
emergency spillway may be assumed to be unclogged.
Stormwater management ponds with embankments completely
made up of natural undisturbed soils (fully in "cut") or where
roadways act as the emergency spillway are permitted.
However, the design engineer must verify downstream stability
and control.
(24) All pre- and postdevelopment comparisons of peak flows shall
be rounded to tenths of a cfs. The intent here is to recognize
the accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic modeling
procedures. Again, small differences between pre- and
postdevelopment discharge rates should be permitted when no
negative downstream impacts will result.
(25) The full Modified Puls routing method must be used for
stormwater management pond analyses. Simplified methods of
determining pond size requirements such as those in TR-55
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:776
(1986) may only be used for preliminary pond size estimates.
The full Modified Puls routing method must be used for
stormwater management pond analyses.
(26) Prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the
analysis of underground stormwater management facilities
unless it can be verified that the program rounding subroutines
used for the stage/storage data do not affect the results. This is
because, for very small storage volumes, the program may
round off the volume to a significant percentage.
(27) Full supporting documentation must be provided for all
stormwater management designs.
(28) Designs must be checked for impervious area flash (IAF). This
check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor
modeling choices specifically related to the time of
concentration. This analysis requires that the watershed
impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas. The
time of concentration should also be determined from the
impervious areas only. If the IAF analysis results in a higher
peak runoff rate at a culvert or discharge from a pond, this
higher rate must be used for the final design/comparison. The
check will frequently yield higher values if a watershed's
impervious area is located primarily near the watershed outlet
or point of interest.
B. Capture Volumes (Cv).
(1) To minimize nuisance flooding from small precipitation events,
a runoff capture volume is required for all stormwater
management ponds that do not discharge directly to natural,
well-defined (with bed and banks) perennial streams. In
general, natural well-defined streams in the Spring Creek
Basin and all of Ferguson Township are limited to those
delineated as USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) perennial
streams. This should be treated as a guideline and not a
steadfast rule. The final determination is at the discretion of
the Township Engineer. The pond capture volume is a volume
of runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation of
any free surface principal spillway orifice. In addition to the
minimum required capture volume identified within this
section, the capture volume may also include all or portions of
the recharge volume and water quality volume (see Subsection
3C and E below). No principal spillway orifice (except those
connected to subsurface drains), regardless of how small, shall
be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume.
(2) The Centre County Conservation District (CCCD) receives
numerous complaints regarding ponds that are located at the
downslope edge of a property that result in discharging runoff
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:777
onto downstream properties in an uncontrolled manner or
where no existing defined outlet channel exists. This is a very
common problem in areas underlain by carbonate rock. These
discharges can cause erosion and flooding downstream. While
the pond capture volume is intended to minimize some of
these negative effects, it cannot deter or reduce the impacts
from poor design practices. Therefore, whenever possible, the
CCCD recommends that the designer consider the downstream
morphological changes that may occur and, when possible,
consider constructing conveyance systems to a stable natural
channel. In some cases this may require cooperation between
landowners.
(3) A minimum capture volume is required to mitigate nuisance
flooding from small precipitation events. The minimum
required capture volume is defined as a runoff depth of 0.25
inch from all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater
management facility. This volume will be allowed to infiltrate,
evaporate, or dewater from a subsurface drain system
connected directly to the facility's principal spillway.
(4) The maximum capture depth shall be 24 inches. [NOTE:
Twenty-four inches is identified as the maximum depth of
water recommended for infiltration facilities in the PA BMP
Manual (Appendix C, Protocol 2 - Infiltration System Design
and Construction Guidelines).] The Township Engineer
reserves the right to require that the capture and peak rate
control be managed in separate facilities in cases where
potential sinkhole damage could cause impacts to public
facilities and/or off-site areas. Special consideration with
regard to allowable capture depth and dewatering time shall
be given to stormwater designs relying on total infiltration, or
where capture of the ten-year event or larger is proposed to be
infiltrated due to site constraints (on site or off site). In these
cases a preapplication meeting shall be held with the Township
Engineer to identify an appropriate design capture depth and
dewatering time. Any increase in capture depth above 24
inches must be supported by a detailed geotechnical report in
support of the increased capture depth.
(5) Supporting computations that show that 90% of the capture
volume can dewater in a maximum of 72 hours must be
provided. The dewatering time must also provide for sufficient
passive water quality treatment. Infiltration rates are to be
maintained at less than six inches per hour unless it is
demonstrated that the soils cation exchange rate is greater
than five meg/100 g in which case the maximum infiltration
rate shall be 10 inches per hour. Basins outfitted with
underdrains for dewatering shall incorporate an orifice at the
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:778
underdrain outlet to maintain dewatering times as specified
above.
(6) To simplify computational requirements for design event
analysis, designers do not need to calculate discharges from
subsurface drains related to the capture volumes if the filter
media is sand, or smaller than AASHTO (American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials) 57 stone. The
capture volume is to control runoff rates from impervious areas
and is not related to water quality. However, pond designs that
include a water quality volume that is greater than the
required capture volume are assumed to have also met the
required capture volume as long as it dewaters as required.
(7) Designs that rely on the natural infiltration of insitu soils must
provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used
for analysis. Infiltration rates reported in the Soil Survey of
Centre County or other published rates may be used at the
discretion of the Township Engineer.
(8) The pond capture volume should always be used when up-slope
areas are developed where the pond's design creates a point
discharge that did not previously exist.
(9) Stormwater management detention facilities that connect
directly to storm drainpipe networks discharging to natural
well-defined channels do not require a capture volume.
C. Recharge Volumes (Rv).
(1) The purpose of the recharge portion of the Part is two-fold.
First, the recharge requirement is to mitigate the loss of
groundwater recharge associated with the creation of
impervious surfaces. In addition the recharge criterion is to
mitigate the increase in runoff volume associated with the
creation of impervious surfaces. This increase in runoff volume
has significant impacts on downstream landowners. These
impacts are most often exhibited in the form of increased
nuisance flooding and channel or drainageway erosion and
instability. According to local municipal engineers and
representatives of the CCCD, these problems are of significant
local concern. The magnitude of these problems increases with
the percentage of impervious coverage created on a site.
(2) Recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all
proposed impervious areas. The required recharge volume
shall be computed as 0.5 inch of runoff from all proposed
impervious areas. It is noted that lined detention ponds and
compacted fill areas are considered to be impervious when
calculating site impervious area for recharge considerations.
In addition, land areas covered by paver blocks, pervious
pavement, and other structural surface treatments which
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:779
permit surface infiltration may be treated as pervious areas
when calculating the site impervious area for recharge
considerations as long as the structural infiltration practice
is supported by sound design and appropriate construction
specifications. The Township Engineer may require submission
of supporting documentation prior to approving structural
infiltration areas as pervious areas. It must also be
demonstrated that the runoff from the area directly tributary to
recharge BMPs will satisfy the recharge volume requirement
during the one-year twenty-four-hour storm.
(3) The following design practices may be used as credits to
reduce the recharge volume requirement:
(a) Residential roof areas (detached, duplex, and townhouse
dwellings) and commercial/industrial buildings with roof
areas less than 5,000 square feet may be removed from the
computed impervious area when these roof areas are
sumped to dry wells designed in accordance with the
following minimum standard:
1) Sump Design Criteria. To meet the recharge criteria,
sump storage or voids volume shall be equal to 0.04
cubic feet per square foot of roof area (0.5 inch
rainfall depth). If sump stone has a voids ratio of 40%,
the total sump volume will be 0.10 cubic feet per
square foot of roof area. When designed only to meet
this recharge criteria, the maximum size for a single
sump is 100 cubic feet, and the minimum sump
surface area (A) to depth (D) ratio (A/D) must be a
minimum of 4/1. The sump depth less any freeboard
shall not exceed 24 inches. This roof sump standard
shall apply unless the Township adopts a separate roof
sump standard for water quantity or peak control.
(b) All or portions of driveways, roadways, and parking areas
may be removed from the impervious area calculation
when sheet flow from these areas is directed to
undisturbed natural buffer/filter areas or constructed filter
strips. This flow must be dispersed as sheet flow as it
crosses the buffer/filter area. Sheet flow velocities should
be nonerosive as they cross the impervious area/filter
interface.
1) To ensure proper infiltration characteristics the
natural soil profile within natural buffer/filter areas
cannot be disturbed during construction. Completely
undisturbed natural recharge areas serve this
function best. However, minor surface scaring,
seeding, and landscaping is permitted in these areas
as long as natural grades are not altered. In special
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:780
cases, when approved by the Township Engineer,
minor grading, combined with soil profile
reconstruction may be permitted in natural buffer/
filter areas. In addition, the following standards apply
to natural filter/buffer areas:
a) Natural filter/buffer areas must have a minimum
width of five feet or one-half of the impervious
area drainage length immediately tributary to the
buffer area, whichever is greater. This width is
measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow.
b) To qualify for a recharge volume credit, the
surface slope of natural filter/buffer areas must be
conducive to recharge, and not result in flow
concentration or erosion. To meet this intent, the
surface slope of the area tributary to the natural
buffer/filter area, and the surface slope of the
natural buffer/filter area itself, may not exceed
5%. In special cases steeper slopes may be used if
specifically authorized by the Township Engineer.
c) The total impervious area tributary to a natural
buffer/filter area cannot exceed twice the buffer/
filter area.
2) To qualify for a recharge volume credit, constructed
filter strips shall be designed to the following
standards:
a) The minimum filter strip width shall be five feet or
one-half of the impervious area drainage length
immediately tributary to the constructed filter
strip, whichever is greater. This width is
measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow.
b) The total impervious area tributary to a
constructed filter strip area cannot exceed twice
the constructed filter strip area.
c) The surface slope of the area tributary to the
constructed filter strip area, and the surface slope
of the constructed filter strip area itself may not
exceed 5% and 3% respectively. In special cases
steeper slopes may be used if specifically
authorized by the Township Engineer.
d) The filter strip surface shall consist of a minimum
of six inches of natural or reconstructed topsoil
with a stable grass surface treatment.
Reconstructed topsoil designs must be approved
by the Township Engineer prior to application.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:781
Reconstructed topsoil consists of soils augmented
by tillage and the addition of soil amendments
such as fertilizers and organic material.
Fertilizers include any organic or inorganic plant
nutrients or soil amendments. Organic material is
any nutrient or compound containing animal or
plant materials such as manure or compost.
e) To minimize erosion of the topsoil layer during
construction, it is recommended that these areas
be sodded. However, the Township Engineer may
permit the use of an acceptable erosion control
seeding application. In this later case, any loss of
topsoil and seed must be replaced until a
permanent vegetative stand is achieved.
(c) Sidewalks separated from roadways and/or other
impervious surfaces by a grass strip of equal or greater
width than the sidewalk itself may be removed from the
impervious area calculation when the sidewalks are
graded so that sheet flow from the walk is directed to the
grass strip. Sidewalks with steep longitudinal slopes that
themselves would act as channels during runoff events
cannot take advantage of this credit. A five-percent
longitudinal sidewalk slope shall be used as the
benchmark defining steep slopes.
(d) Impervious areas tributary to natural closed depressions
may be subtracted from the total site impervious area used
in the recharge volume calculation as long as a qualified
geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to the
soundness of these site-specific applications. Water quality
pretreatment may be necessary prior to the direct
discharge of runoff to existing closed depressions or
sinkholes.
(e) Impervious areas tributary to man-made closed
depressions may be subtracted from the total site
impervious area as long as a qualified geotechnical
engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of
these site-specific applications. Man-made closed
depressions may be created through the use of low head
berms one foot or less in height.
(f) Additional credits may apply for undisturbed land areas
that are known to have high infiltration capacity and that
are maintained or enhanced. These areas must be defined
and quantified from actual site data collection.
(4) After credits, the remaining recharge volume shall be directed
to a recharge BMP such as infiltration trenches, beds, etc.
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:782
These facilities may be located in open areas or under
pavement structures. The appropriateness of the particular
infiltration practice proposed, as well as the design parameters
used, shall be supported by a geotechnical report certified by a
qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist,
geotechnical engineer).
(5) Stormwater recharge requirements or credits affect
stormwater management design requirements. For stormwater
management computations, the reduction of site CNs based
only on a weighting type analysis, as is sometimes done for
cluster type developments, is not permitted. However, for
stormwater management purposes, the CN for recharged
areas may be computed using the NRCS method for
disconnected impervious areas. The actual hydrologic process
that occurs within the basin must be stressed in all recharge
situations.
(6) These recharge requirements must be met on all sites unless it
can be demonstrated that recharge would be inappropriate.
Any request for such a waiver from these recharge
requirements must be accompanied by a supporting report
certified by a qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist,
hydrogeologist, geotechnical engineer).
(7) Developers and site design professionals are encouraged to
use a higher standard for recharge volume on sites where local
site conditions do not restrict a higher standard.
(8) Water quality sensitive (WQS) developments must use an
acceptable pretreatment BMP prior to recharge. Acceptable
pretreated BMPs for these developments include BMPs that
are based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes
such as chemical coagulation. If infiltration devices, including
subsurface exfiltration devices, are to be utilized as a part of
the SWM design for a development in the WQS district, the
infiltration rate should be a maximum six in./hr. to allow proper
soil filtration/passive treatment of the runoff. A maximum
infiltration rate of 10 in./hr. may be used for soils with
demonstrated cation exchange rates greater than five. This
infiltration rate may be achieved through soil amendments or
engineered soil media.
(9) Accounting for recharge within lined stormwater management
ponds is not permitted. However, if unlined, uncompacted
ponds and/or depressed lawn areas are used to satisfy water
quality or capture volume criteria, these areas and volumes
may also be used to meet recharge requirements as previously
defined. Additional recharge volume may be credited to these
areas as long as it is demonstrated by a qualified professional
that recharge processes can naturally occur in these areas.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:783
(10) Finally, because this analysis is concerned with trying to
adequately represent real processes that occur within the
watershed, there will be areas that cannot physically recharge
stormwater. These areas include exfiltration areas that are
commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where clay
pans exist, and saturation areas near major streams or
floodplains. These areas may not accept recharge during most
runoff events. These areas are exempt from recharge
requirements when these conditions are documented and
certified by a qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist,
hydrogeologist, or geotechnical engineer). In addition,
stormwater management techniques relying on infiltration
techniques are not permitted in these areas.
(11) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge requirement
in the following situations:
(a) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge
requirement in highly developed areas or areas
undergoing redevelopment where the Township Engineer
has determined that forced recharge could have adverse
impacts on adjacent landowner structures, property, or
Township infrastructure. These waivers should be limited
to small land areas (generally less than five acres in size),
where the ability to place recharge beds may be limited or
may hinder redevelopment.
(b) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge
requirement in areas where a qualified soils scientist or
geologist has determined that none of the site soils are
suitable for recharge, or that the location of the suitable
soils is such that harm to adjoining properties could occur
as stated under Subsection 11A above.
(c) The Township Engineer may waive the recharge
requirement in areas where recharge cannot physically
occur as documented by a qualified soil scientist,
geologist, or hydrologist. These areas include:
1) Exfiltration areas commonly found at the base of
wooded hillsides where clay pans or fragipans exist;
and
2) Saturation areas near major streams or floodplains.
(12) As identified above, recharge analysis and/or waiver requests
must be supported by a geotechnical report sealed by a
qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist,
or geotechnical engineer). The intent of this report will be to
establish the suitability of a particular parcel of land or area for
recharge, and to identify areas on a development site
appropriate for recharge. It is recommended that the
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:784
geotechnical/soils consultant discuss the extent and approach
to the analysis with the Township Engineer prior to initiating
the field investigation. At a minimum this report should include
the following information:
(a) A description of the geotechnical site investigation
performed including the methods and procedures used.
(b) Data presentation.
(c) Analysis results including the following minimum
information:
1) A map identifying site areas inappropriate for
recharge along with supporting justification. In
addition to illustrating topographic features,
significant geologic and hydrologic features should be
identified (rock outcrops, sinkholes, closed
depressions, etc).
2) Determination of the permeability coefficient for
potential recharge areas.
3) Determination of the infiltration capacity of natural
site soils.
4) Location, depth, and permeability coefficient for any
restrictive layers identified.
5) Soil uniformity.
6) Depth to bedrock in potential recharge areas, and a
statement reflecting the uniformity of the depth to
bedrock across the site.
7) A statement relating to the site's proximity to fracture
zones within the bedrock.
8) Additional information deemed pertinent by the
geotechnical engineer.
9) In sensitive area districts, projects shall also comply
with the following requirements for a preliminary
geologic investigation:
a) A qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist,
hydrogeologist, or geotechnical engineer) shall
review aerial photographs, soils, geologic and
other available related data including the local
public water supplier's source water protection
study, as the data relates to the subject property.
The qualified professional shall also conduct a
comprehensive field view and inspection of the
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:785
property, and consult with the public water
supplier's consulting hydrogeologist. Based on
the above information, the professional shall
prepare a map of the site indicating the following:
(i) Closed depressions.
(ii) Open sinkholes.
(iii) Outcrops of bedrock.
(iv) Surface drainage into ground.
(v) "Ghost lakes" after rainfall.
(vi) Lineaments, faults and fracture traces.
(vii) Limonite excavations and quarries.
b) Based on the map prepared above, and in
conjunction with other mapping and available
information, the geologist shall prepare a report
on project suitability and the impact potential on
the groundwater resource of the water quality
sensitive areas. The report shall demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this chapter,
including any recommended mitigating measures
designed to ensure compliance.
c) In addition, infiltration facilities shall be located
greater than 50 feet from any critical geologic
features identified in the geotechnical report or
geophysical testing report unless the reports
provide for approved mitigating measures that
will produce no negative impact on groundwater
recharge or quality.
10) If the preliminary geologic investigation identifies a
significant potential for sinkhole formation, or where
soil and subsurface conditions may not be suitable,
additional geologic investigations may be determined
to be necessary. This determination will be at the
discretion of the Township Engineer. The additional
investigations and analysis may include electrical
resistivity tomography or other similar types of
geophysical testing. A detailed report of the
geophysical testing along with recommendations for
avoidance of sinkhole-prone areas shall be included in
the stormwater management site plan.
(d) Recommendations for any special design considerations
necessary for the design of recharge systems on the site.
For example, required soil depth over bedrock,
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:786
appropriate surface grades over recharge areas,
appropriate hydraulic head over recharge areas,
alternative siting, increased use of decentralized and
nonstructural SWM techniques and/or remediation
recommendations must be included in the report.
(e) Justification as to why the site should be developed to a
high impervious density if the site has adverse soil and
geotechnical limitations, which prohibit the ability to
induce natural recharge. Explanation how these
limitations will not create the potential for undue harm to
the environment and the Spring Creek Watershed or other
any area in Ferguson Township when the site is developed.
(f) Where it has been shown that recharge cannot be
performed and a waiver of the recharge requirements is
being requested, the Township shall require that the first
one inch of runoff from all new impervious areas be
treated through underdrained facilities. These facilities
may include underdrained basins, rain gardens, and
infiltration trenches. Treatment is to include use of an
amended topsoil to provide filtration of the stormwater. All
underdrain outlets are to include a restrictor plate to
prevent the underdrain system from functioning as a
primary outlet.
(13) The following guidelines apply to the use of subsurface
exfiltration BMPs (often incorrectly referred to as engineered
infiltration BMPs):
(a) Soils shall have minimum infiltration rates as specified in
§ 26-304, Subsection 3F. If no site soils have percolation
rates meeting these standards, subsurface exfiltration
BMPs shall not be used.
(b) A minimum of 30 inches of soil shall be maintained
between the bottom of a subsurface exfiltration BMP and
the top of bedrock or seasonally high groundwater table
(the upper surface of a layer of saturated material in the
soil), unless a qualified geotechnical engineer provides
documentation supporting a design depth less than 30
inches and the minimum depth is approved by the
Township Engineer.
(c) If the minimum percolation rate is not met and/or the
minimum soil depth cannot be maintained on a site,
recharge should be accommodated by directing shallow
sheet flow from impervious areas across surface filter
strips and/or undisturbed natural areas, or some other
innovative surface infiltration feature should be used.
Limiting subsurface percolation rates and/or depth to
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:787
bedrock shall not by themselves warrant a recharge
waiver.
(14) In addition, since recharge is intended as a volume control,
innovative or new methods that address the significant
increase in the volume of runoff from sites having large
impervious areas are encouraged. These volume control
alternatives may be used only if they can be shown to function
with the original intent through sound engineering and
science. The final determination of "original intent" shall
always be the right of the Township Engineer.
D. Storm Drain Conveyance System Design. Storm drainage
conveyance systems consist of storm sewer pipes, swales, and open
channels. Computational methods for design of storm drain
conveyance systems shall be as follows:
(1) Recommended computational methods (models) for storm
drain design are based on site or watershed drainage area as
follows:
Size Model
Up to 200 acres Rational Method
Between 200 acres and 1.5
square miles
HEC-1
PSRM
TR-20
Over 1.5 square miles PSU-IV with the carbonate
adjustment factor at the
discretion of the Township
Engineer
Other methods as approved by
the Township Engineer such as
SWMM, SWIRM-ROUTE, etc.
(2) Rational Coefficients used are to be from Rawls et al. (1981),
PADOT Design Manual 2-10 or using the Aron curves
(Appendix A, Table 3)67 to convert CNs to C. For previously
disturbed or newly disturbed pervious areas, runoff
coefficients should be appropriately adjusted to reflect an
increase in runoff associated with the loss of natural soil
structure. If the Aron curves are used, CNs must also be
adjusted to reflect the loss of soil structure in disturbed areas
by reducing the HSG as identified by the NRCS by a minimum
of 1 HSG level. For example, if the natural HSG designation is
B, an HSG of C should be used for disturbed soils. These
disturbed area adjustments to HSG levels do not apply to
67.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:788
minimally disturbed areas. The design engineer may choose to
use the following Rational C coefficients without regard to soil
HSG for small sites. However, it is recommended that they be
used only for storm drains up to 24 inches in diameter. The
use of these conservative values shall fully be the choice of the
design engineer.
All impervious areas C = 0.95
All pervious areas C = 0.30
(3) Storm drains shall be designed at a minimum using a ten-year
runoff event without surcharging inlets. Storm drains tributary
to a multiple site stormwater management facility across
Township roads or crossing other properties must convey, at a
minimum, a twenty-five-year runoff event without surcharging
inlets. Runoff events in excess of the indicated design event
must be conveyed safely downstream.
(4) Inlets on grade cannot assume a sumped condition for
hydraulic modeling (i.e., top of inlet casting set below
pavement surface in parking areas).
(5) The Township Engineer may require the analysis of the onehundred-
year peak runoff rates for conveyance purposes in
some instances where regional stormwater management
facilities are employed.
(6) Any storm drain within state or federal rights-of-way or one
that falls under the design criteria of any higher authority must
meet the requirements of that agency in addition to the
minimum requirements of this chapter.
(7) The time of concentration (Tc) may be computed by any
method which best represents the subject watershed.
However, the NRCS's segmental method is not recommended
for use with drainage areas that are predominately
undeveloped and are greater than 100 acres in size. The NRCS
Lag Equation or another more appropriate method should be
used under these conditions.
(8) For any drainage area smaller than five acres in size, a Tc of
five minutes may always be assumed at the discretion of the
design engineer (for the postdevelopment condition), without
needing to provide supporting documentation.
(9) Precipitation values shall be taken from the current version of
NOAA Atlas 14 at a station closest to the project site and/or
most representative of the project site. The current version of
the PennDOT IDF curves can be used only if required by
PennDOT. Appropriate documentation supporting the selected
precipitation values used shall be provided.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:789
(10) Storm drain conveyance system stability (swales, open
channels, and pipe discharge aprons) shall be computed using
a ten-year return period peak runoff rate.
(11) Storm sewers, where required by zoning and land use
densities, shall be placed under or immediately adjacent to the
roadway side of the curb, or as directed by the Township, when
parallel to the street within the right-of-way.
(12) When located in undedicated land, storm sewers shall be
placed within a drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide
as approved by the Township Engineer.
(13) The use of properly designed, graded and turfed drainage
swales is encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial
and industrial areas and, where approved by the Township
Engineer, in residential areas. Such swales shall be designed
not only to carry the required discharge without excessive
erosion, but also to increase the time of concentration, reduce
the peak discharge and velocity, and permit the water to
percolate into the soil, where appropriate.
(14) Inlets.
(a) Inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Standards for
Roadway Construction as approved by the Township
Engineer.
1) Inlets shall, at a minimum, be located at the lowest
point of street intersections to intercept the
stormwater before it reaches pedestrian crossing; or
at sag points of vertical curves in the street alignment
which provide a natural point of ponding of surface
stormwater.
2) Where the Township deems it necessary because of
special land requirements, special inlets may be
approved.
3) The interval between inlets collecting stormwater
runoff shall be determined in accordance with DM-2,
Chapter 10, Section 3, "Capacity of Roadway
Hydraulic Facilities." Flank inlets in low areas may
only be required on higher order streets at the
discretion of the Township Engineer.
(b) In curbed sections, the maximum encroachment of water
on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through traffic lane or one inch less than the depth of curb
during the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration.
Inlets shall be provided to control the encroachment of
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:790
water on the pavement. When inlets are used in a storm
system within the right-of-way limits of a street in lieu of
manholes, the spacing of such inlets shall not exceed the
maximum distance of 450 feet.
(15) Accessible drainage structures shall be located on a
continuous storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at
all locations where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is
required, at all vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding
5°, and at all points of convergence of two or more influent
storm sewer mains. The construction locations of accessible
drainage structures shall be as indicated on the land
development stormwater management plan or area
stormwater management plan approved by the Township.
(16) When evidence available to the Township indicates that
existing storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined
by hydrograph summation and are accessible, the subdivider
may connect its stormwater facilities to the existing storm
sewers so long as the peak rate of discharge does not exceed
the amount permitted by this chapter.
(17) All storm drain culvert pipes shall be designed to maintain a
minimum grade of 1/2%. All storm pipes shall have a minimum
inside diameter of 15 inches or a cross-sectional area of 176
square inches, except that pipes under 20 feet or greater fill
shall not be less than 24 inches or a cross-sectional area of 453
inches and shall consist of reinforced concrete.
(18) Computational procedures other than those indicated here
should follow the methods of the Federal Highway
Administration's Urban Drainage Design Manual [Hydraulic
Engineering Circular No 22. (HEC-22)].
(19) Swales provided in cut areas shall be designed such that
stormwater will not encroach upon the shoulder during a
twenty-five-year frequency storm. Flooding of the subbase
shall be avoided.
E. Water Quality Standards.
(1) Water Quality Performance Standards. To minimize adverse
impacts to stream health resulting from stormwater nonpoint
source (NPS) pollution, standards are provided for the
implementation of water quality best management practices
(BMPs) to reduce NPS pollutant loadings resulting from land
development activities. The following performance standards
and guidelines shall be addressed at all sites where
stormwater management is required.
(a) Site designs shall minimize the generation of stormwater
runoff through the use of low-impact design techniques.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:791
(b) Stormwater runoff from all land development activities
should be treated through the use of nonstructural and
structural BMPs to effectively treat the adverse impacts of
stormwater runoff including NPS pollutants.
(c) Water quality BMPs shall be incorporated into site designs
to treat the required water quality volume as defined
below.
(d) The use of nonstructural BMPs shall always take priority
over the use of structural BMPs. The use of innovative
BMPs and low-impact site planning is encouraged to
reduce the generation of stormwater runoff and effectively
treat pollutants transported in stormwater from the site.
(e) The use of multiple nonstructural water quality techniques
along with new, emerging, and innovative techniques is
encouraged to improve the quality of stormwater runoff to
receiving areas and reduce and/or eliminate the need for
structural BMPs. The Township Engineer should be
consulted to clarify the design concept for meeting or
exceeding the intent of this section.
(f) Where nonstructural BMPs are unable to effectively treat
all of the stormwater runoff generated from land
development activities, structural BMPs shall be designed
to capture and treat the computed water quality volume
(WQv).
(g) The priority pollutant source areas to be treated with
BMPs are streets, parking lots, driveways, and roof areas.
(h) Due to the karst nature of the watershed, stormwater
discharges from water quality sensitive developments and
discharges to sensitive wellhead protection areas (defined
in Appendix B, Exhibit 1)68 will require special
consideration. In these instances, the applicant shall
provide water quality pretreatment (use of a filtering BMP
and/or special structural design features) to prevent the
discharge of stormwater contaminants to groundwater
resources. In addition, preliminary hydrogeologic studies
shall be required to document potential karst-related
impacts.
(i) In water quality sensitive area districts groundwater
quality monitoring wells may be required for development
sites greater than 10 acres in size. The need for water
quality monitoring wells will be determined on a case-bycase
basis by the Township Engineer based on the results
of the geologic investigations.
68.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:792
(j) In water quality sensitive area districts where rock
excavation is anticipated as part of the project
construction, the following note shall be added to the plan:
"This project is located within a source water protection
area for the (insert name of water provider). Blasting
should be used as a last resort method of rock
excavation. If blasting techniques are to be employed,
the contractor shall provide the Township and the water
provider with information supporting the use of blasting
techniques along with copies of blasting permits."
(k) Prior to stormwater management and water quality
design, applicants should consult with the Township
Engineer to verify stormwater quality criteria and present
proposed features and concepts for the treatment of
stormwater runoff. Following this meeting, the Township
Engineer shall define any needed support studies or
documentation.
(2) Water Quality Volume (WQv).
(a) The required water quality volume that must be treated for
nonsensitive areas underlain by carbonate rock (see
exhibits in Appendix B)69 within the Township shall be
computed as:
WQdepth = 0.25 + (0.012)2.9(0.044(SIA))
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = water quality volume in acrefeet
WQdepth = depth in inches that must be
captured for impervious areas
SIA = percent of site impervious area
(all paved areas and roof with
asphalt-based roofs)
A = total of all paved areas and
asphalt-based roofs on site in
acres
(b) The required water quality volume that must be treated for
any WQS development, on sites in sensitive areas
underlain by carbonate rock, and all areas not underlain
by carbonate rock is to be computed within the entire
Spring Creek Basin as:
69.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:793
WQdepth = the larger of 0.5 inches or 0.25 +
(0.012)2.9(0.044(SIA))
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = water quality volume in acrefeet
WQdepth = depth in inches that must be
captured for impervious areas
SIA = percent of site impervious area
(all paved areas and roof with
asphalt-based roofs)
A = total of all paved areas and
asphalt-based roofs on site in
acres
(c) For designs in which the final roof material is unknown,
the design engineer must assume an asphalt-based roof.
(d) The water quality volume must be captured and treated
through a water quality BMP over an extended period of
time as per the specific requirements of each structure.
Credits to reduce the effective impervious area are
applicable as presented in this section.
(3) Water Quality Credits. Due to the karst nature of the Spring
Creek Basin and areas of Ferguson Township, the
nonstructural water quality credits and techniques identified
below may be limited for suitability and use based on
development type and location. These limitations for use are
specified in the restrictions section for each credit. The
Township Engineer may require additional documentation or
investigation prior to use of each specific credit to reduce the
risks of sinkhole development or groundwater contamination
for sensitive areas and development types. No area may be
double counted for use with credits. The combined credits of
natural area conservation and vegetated filter strips is limited
to 50% of the site's impervious area. The drainageway credit is
limited to 50% of the site's impervious area. The drainageway
protection credit is limited to 50% of the site's impervious
area. The maximum total water quality credit for any site may
therefore be 100% of the site's impervious area.

discharged over pervious
areas from impervious site

(4) Drainageway Protection.
(a) A water quality credit is given for the protection of natural
drainageways on a development site. Natural karst
drainageways within the Spring Creek Watershed and
Ferguson Township often do not exhibit a defined channel
bed and banks. More often, these drainageways appear as
wide, shallow parabolic swales. These drainageways are
an integral part of the natural drainage system, and often
exhibit significant infiltration capacity. Protection of these
drainageways is critically important to the health of the
watershed.
(b) The drainageway protection (DWP) area is defined as an
area centered on the drainageway and having a width
equivalent to the one-hundred-year flow spread. The
Township Engineer may modify the defined minimum
width in cases where natural landforms define an
appropriate alternate width.
(c) The impervious area used in the WQv equation for the
development site may be reduced by twice the area of the
preserved drainageway (two to one ratio).
1) Restrictions on the Credit:
a) Drainageway protection areas must remain in an
undisturbed condition during and after
construction activities. There shall be no
construction activity within these areas including
temporary access roads or storage of equipment
or materials. Temporary access for the
construction of utilities crossing this protection
area may be permitted at the Township Engineer's
discretion. However, the alignment of any such
crossing must be perpendicular to the
drainageway.
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:795
b) These areas should be placed in a conservation
easement or be permanently preserved through a
similarly enforceable agreement with the
Township.
c) The limits of the undisturbed DWP area and
conservation easement must be shown on all
construction plans.
d) The DWP area must be located on the
development site.
e) The maximum total DWPA credit is 100% of the
site impervious area.
f) Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
2) Sensitive Area and Development Restrictions:
a) DWP areas may not be counted as a credit in
sensitive areas unless the impervious area
actually flows across the area as sheet flow.
b) Untreated urban runoff from sensitive
development types may not be directed to DWP
areas without pretreatment.
(5) Natural Area Conservation. A water quality credit is given for
natural areas that are conserved at the development site,
thereby maintaining predevelopment water quality
characteristics. The impervious area used in the WQv equation
for the development site may be reduced by the natural area
conserved in the water quality volume computations. Natural
area conservation is different than vegetated filter strip/
recharge area and drainageway protection in that in some
cases surface runoff may never be directed over the natural
area (i.e., if upslope wooded areas are conserved).
(a) Restrictions on the Credit:
1) Natural areas must remain in an undisturbed
condition during and after construction activities.
Temporary incidental land disturbance activities
associated with utility construction may be permitted
within the conservation area.
2) These areas should be placed in a conservation
easement or similarly enforceable agreement with the
Township.
3) The limits of the undisturbed area and conservation
easement must be shown on all construction plans.
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:796
4) The area must be located on the development site.
5) Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
6) The maximum total natural area credit is 50% of the
site impervious area. However, the combination of
natural area credit and vegetated filter strip credit is
also 50%.
(b) Sensitive Area and Development Restrictions:
1) NAC areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive
areas unless the impervious area actually flows across
the area as sheet flow.
2) Untreated urban runoff from sensitive development
types may not be directed to natural areas without
pretreatment.
(6) Filter/Buffer Area. A water quality credit is given when
stormwater runoff is effectively treated via a filter/buffer area
or strip. A filter/buffer area is a vegetated boundary
characterized by uniform mild slopes. Filter strips may be
forested or vegetated with turf grass. Effective treatment is
achieved when impervious area runoff is directed as sheet flow
across vegetative filter or buffer areas (i.e., concentrated flow
discharged to a filter strip does not meet water quality
reduction criteria). The area draining via overland sheet flow
to an undisturbed, natural, vegetated filter strip (natural
unmaintained meadow or forested area) may be subtracted
from the site impervious area (IA) on a 1:1 area ratio in the
water quality volume computation. Impervious areas draining
across constructed (disturbed or regarded) pervious areas may
be subtracted from the site impervious area (IA) on a 1:1/2
area ratio in the water quality volume computation.
(a) Restrictions on the Credit:
1) The maximum impervious area that may be included
in this credit shall be computed as follows:
IAc = WIA LIA
Where:
IAc = Impervious area recharge
credit (L2)
LIA = Length of impervious area
measured perpendicular to the
sheet flow direction (L)
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-304
FWD:797
WIA = Width of impervious area (L).
Maximum width permitted for
credit is the smaller of 100
feet or twice the width of the
vegetated filter strip
2) To quality for a water quality credit, natural and
constructed filter areas or strips must meet the same
restrictions identified for natural or constructed
recharge areas with regard to width, length, slope,
tributary drainage length, and construction. These
restrictions are presented in Chapter 3.
3) Runoff shall enter the filter/buffer strip as overland
sheet flow.
4) Filter/buffer areas shall remain undisturbed/
unmanaged other than to remove accumulated trash
and debris.
5) Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
6) The maximum total water quality credit for vegetative
filter/buffer areas is 50% of the site impervious area.
However, the combination of NAC and filter/buffer
areas is also 50%.
(b) Sensitive Area and Development Restrictions:
1) Untreated urban runoff from WQS developments may
not be directed to filter/buffer areas without
pretreatment.
(7) Comments Related to Water Quality Credits.
(a) Concurrence of the Township Engineer is required prior to
the use of all water quality credits for the reduction of the
water quality treatment volume. The Township Engineer
may approve the use of additional credits based upon
sufficient documentation regarding suitability for sensitive
development types and areas, pollutant removal
effectiveness, and maintenance criteria. Multiple water
quality credits cannot be claimed for the identical area of
the site (i.e., a stream buffer credit and disconnecting roof
recharge area cannot both be claimed for the same area).
(b) Additional impervious coverage reduction using lowimpact
development techniques (development practices
which reduce the impact of urban runoff such as narrower
residential road sections, smaller culs-de-sac, smaller
parking stalls, smaller building setbacks to reduce
§ 26-304 FERGUSON CODE § 26-304
FWD:798
§ 26-305. Erosion and Sedimentation Requirements. [Ord. 1018, 6/
6/2016]
driveway lengths, etc.) will also reduce the required water
quality treatment volume. Many of these techniques
require prior approval by the Township before
implementation into land development design.
F. Infiltration Test Requirements. Infiltration testing shall be
performed in accordance with the current version of the
Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual and
as outlined here.
(1) Double ring infiltrometer methods are the preferred method
for establishing design infiltration rates. Borehole tests may be
used in cases where proposed infiltration surfaces are at a
depth not reasonably accessible using infiltrometer methods.
Other test methods may be used with prior approval by the
Township Engineer.
(2) Double ring infiltrometers shall have inner rings six inches or
more in diameter.
(3) Design infiltration rates shall be based only on infiltration tests
performed less than 15 feet horizontally and one foot vertically
from the infiltration surface. If a more restrictive soil layer is
identified at a depth greater than one foot below the basin, the
more restrictive layer shall be used.
(4) A minimum of three infiltration tests shall be performed for
infiltration BMPs having footprints less than or equal to 0.5
acre. For basins larger than 0.5 acre a minimum of six
infiltration tests shall be performed per acre of basin footprint.
For borehole tests using inner casings less than six inches in
diameter, the number of infiltration test locations shall be
doubled. In all cases, test locations shall be evenly distributed
across the basin. Infiltration test locations shall be documented
on the stormwater management site plan drawing.
(5) The infiltration rate shall be consistent with rates
recommended in the current version of the Pennsylvania
Stormwater BMP Manual and as specified in this chapter,
including limitations on rates associated with soils having low
cation exchange rates.
1. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, Erosion Control, and in
§ 26-304 FOREWORD § 26-305
FWD:799
§ 26-306. Sinkhole Protection. [Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
accordance with the Centre County Conservation District and the
standards and specifications of the Township.
2. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria that must be applied where recharge or water quality BMPs are
proposed include the following:
A. Areas proposed for these BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity. They shall not be
used as sediment traps unless there are no other options on the
site. If used as sediment traps, they must have two feet of existing
soil remain for use during the sediment trap stage that is excavated
just prior to conversion to an infiltration BMP.
B. If possible, these BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff
until the entire contributory drainage area to the BMP has received
final stabilization.
3. Adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels
and at all points of discharge.
1. The use of sinkholes for stormwater management must be carefully
planned, because discharging runoff directly into existing sinkholes is
not an engineered stormwater solution. Aside from potential water
quality effects, cover collapse sinkholes that exist throughout the
watershed can be unstable, and it should be assumed that they could
stop taking water at any time. Numerous sinkholes throughout the
region already flood during larger runoff events. Nonetheless, in the
watershed there are large drainage areas that completely drain to
existing sinkholes and all upslope development tributary to them
cannot be realistically stopped. Therefore, the following sections have
been developed.
A. Stormwater from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof
drains, or other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged
directly into sinkholes without prior filtration in accordance with
§ 26-306, Subsection 1B, below.
B. Sinkholes capable of absorbing substantial amounts of stormwater
shall be protected by diverting such runoff around the sinkhole
(refer to Subsection 1F) or, upon recommended approval of the
Township Engineer, by planting and maintaining a dense filter path
of suitable vegetative material in such a manner and location to
disperse and slow the runoff to a sheet flow condition to promote
the maximum possible filtration and sedimentation of impurities.
(1) The filter path must be at least 100 feet in length and 20 feet in
width. Ten-foot-wide filter paths are acceptable if land slope is
less than 2%.
§ 26-305 FERGUSON CODE § 26-306
FWD:800
§ 26-307. Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities.
[Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
(2) Filter paths shall be designed and installed so that they filter
sheet flow rather than concentrated flow. If concentrated flow
occurs, grading and shaping or the use of best management
practices such as grass waterways or drop structures may be
required.
(3) Sedimentation basins designed to DEP Chapter 102 standards
or permanent stormwater storage criteria, whichever is larger,
and proposed vegetative filter paths, in conjunction with
temporary stone filter check dams, shall be installed prior to
subdivision or land development construction activities, where
sinkholes are used to accept stormwater discharges.
C. If increased runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole, even in
filtered conditions, a hydrogeologic assessment of the effects of
such runoff on the increased risk of land subsidence and adverse
impacts to existing sinkhole floodplains and groundwater quality
shall be made by a qualified professional and submitted with the
stormwater management plan. Such discharge shall be prohibited
if the Township Engineer determines that such poses a hazard to
life, property or groundwater resources.
D. Sinkholes that exist in natural drainageways shall be protected and
should be utilized to accept that flow of water currently
discharging to the sinkhole. All sinkholes shall be posted by clearly
visible permanent on-site notices prohibiting any disposal of refuse,
rubbish, hazardous wastes, organic matter or soil into the sinkhole.
A uniform grade select rock fill may be permitted in the sinkhole for
the purpose of preventing dumping of said materials, subject to
approval of the Township Engineer.
E. To protect sensitive Karst areas, the Township Engineer may
require basins to contain an impervious liner. The liner may be of
the impervious membrane type, placed in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations, or may be constructed by
mixing Bentonite, or an approved alternative, with existing soil
available at the site as approved by the Township Engineer.
F. If it is determined that runoff from upslope developing areas should
be diverted around a sinkhole due to existing problems, the
Township Engineer may require additional upstream volume
controls as required to protect downstream areas.
1. Materials, Workmanship and Methods: All materials, workmanship and
methods of work shall comply at a minimum with the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Form 408 specifications, as accepted and
commonly used by the Township, and shall be considered to be
incorporated into this chapter as if copied in full. In the event a conflict
§ 26-306 FOREWORD § 26-307
FWD:801
arises between the requirements of this chapter and the Form 408
Specifications, the Township Engineer shall resolve the difference, and
his opinion shall be binding.
A. General.
(1) Facilities in State Rights-of-Way. Any stormwater facility
located on a state highway right-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PADOT). Any stormwater facility that discharges directly onto
a state highway right-of-way shall be subject to review by the
PADOT.
(2) Water Obstructions. Any facilities that constitute water
obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as directed in
PADEP Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced from
time to time by PADEP), shall be designed in accordance with
Chapter 105 and will require a permit from PADEP. Any other
drainage conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter
105 regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the
drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the twenty-fiveyear
design storm with a minimum of 1.0 foot of freeboard
measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway
for local streets, runoff from the fifty-year design storm
measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway
for collector streets, and runoff from the one-hundred-year
design storm measured below the lowest point along the top of
the roadway for arterial streets. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey
runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm with a minimum
of 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along
the top of roadway. Any facility that constitutes a dam as
defined in PADEP Chapter 105 regulations may require a
permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility located
within a PADOT right-of-way must meet PADOT minimum
design standards and permit submission requirements.
(3) Conveyance Facilities. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or
channel that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must
be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the return period design storm as
specified in § 26-304, Subsection 3D. Conveyance facilities to
or exiting from stormwater management facilities (i.e.,
detention basins) shall be designed to convey the design flow
to or from that structure. If the conveyance facility connects to
an existing stormpipe or conveyance facility, the design
engineer must show that the existing facility has the capacity
to accept the additional water flow. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey
runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm. Any facility
§ 26-307 FERGUSON CODE § 26-307
FWD:802
located within a PADOT right-of-way must meet PADOT
minimum design standards and permit submission
requirements.
B. Stormwater Basin Design Considerations. Stormwater
management basins for the control of stormwater peak discharges
shall meet the following minimum requirements.
(1) The design of all facilities over limestone formations shall
include measures to prevent groundwater contamination and,
where required, sinkhole formation. Soils used for the
construction of basins shall have moderate to low erodibility
factors (i.e., "K" factors of 0.32 or less). Any basin greater than
four feet in height, measured from the top of berm to the
downslope toe of the abutment, must also contain:
(a) Berm soil specifications;
(b) A determination if site soils are available for the
construction of the berm or cutoff trench;
(c) An impervious cutoff trench, which extends the full length
of the downstream berm located in fill.
(2) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from
basins. Generally, outlet pipes designed to carry the
predevelopment, one-year storm flow will be permitted to
discharge to a stream with only an energy dissipator.
Discharges to drainage swales shall be spread with a level
spreader or piped to an acceptable point.
(3) Outlet Structures:
(a) Outlet structures within detention/retention basins shall
be constructed of reinforced concrete or an approved
alternate. With the exception of those openings designed
to carry perennial stream flows, design openings 12 inches
or less shall have nonclogging trash racks and all openings
over 12 inches shall have childproof nonclogging trash
racks. Outlet aprons shall be designed and shall extend at
a minimum to the toe of the basin slope. Where spillways
will be used to control peak discharges in excess of the
ten-year storm, the control weirs shall be constructed to
withstand the pressures of impounded waters and convey
flows at computed outlet velocities without erosion.
(b) All metal risers, where approved for use, shall be suitably
coated to prevent corrosion. A trash rack or similar
appurtenance shall be provided to prevent debris from
entering the riser. All metal risers shall have a concrete
base attached with a watertight connection. The base shall
§ 26-307 FOREWORD § 26-307
FWD:803
be sufficient weight to prevent flotation of the riser. An
antivortex device, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal
to the basin berm, shall be provided on the top of all metal
risers.
(4) Emergency Spillway:
(a) Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow
up to and including the one-hundred-year
postdevelopment conditions. The height of embankment
must be set as to provide a minimum 0.5 foot of freeboard
above the elevation required to safely pass the onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow. Should any
stormwater management facility require a dam safety
permit under PADEP Chapter 105, the facility shall be
designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the
regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which
may be required to pass storms larger than a one-hundredyear
event.
1) Any underground stormwater management facility
(pipe storage systems) must have a method to bypass
flows higher than the required design (up to a onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow) without
structural failure or causing downstream harm or
safety risks.
2) Any stormwater management facility that has a paved
roadway as the lower berm should safely convey the
one-hundred-year storm under the paved roadway.
(b) Emergency spillways shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete, vegetated earth, or riprap in accordance with
generally accepted engineering practices. All emergency
spillways shall be constructed so that the detention basin
berm is protected against erosion. The minimum capacity
of all emergency spillways shall be the peak flow rate from
the one-hundred-year design storm. The dimensions of the
emergency spillways can be determined from the Centre
County Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
Emergency spillways shall extend along the upstream and
downstream berm embankment slopes. Protection should
be provided on the upstream embankment a minimum of
three feet below the spillway crest elevation. Protection at
the downstream slope of the spillway shall, as a minimum,
extend to the toe of the berm embankment. The
emergency spillway shall not be located on or discharge
§ 26-307 FERGUSON CODE § 26-307
FWD:804
over uncompacted earthen fill and/or easily erodible
material.
(c) Rock-filled gabions may be used where combination berm
and emergency spillway structures are required to prevent
concentrated flows. The Township Engineer may require
the use of open concrete lattice blocks, stone riprap, or
concrete spillways when slopes would exceed four feet
horizontal to one foot vertical and spillway velocities might
exceed Soil Conservation Service standards for the
particular soils involved.
(5) Antiseep Collars: Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the
detention basin berms. The antiseep collars and their
connections to the pipe barrel shall be watertight. The antiseep
collars shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside
of the principal pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between
collars shall be 14 times the minimum projection of the collar
measured perpendicular to the pipe.
(6) Slope of Detention Basin Embankment. The top or toe of any
slope shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any property
line. Whenever possible the side slopes and basin shape shall
be amenable to the natural topography. Straight side slopes
and rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(a) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical, and may be further
reduced if the soil has unstable characteristics.
(b) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical, except with approval of the
Township. Retaining walls will be required if a stable slope
cannot be maintained. All retaining walls shall be designed
as per the procedures outlined in the American
Association of State Highway Officials, Standard
Specifications for Highway Bridges, 1973. Details and
calculations prepared and stamped and signed by a
registered professional engineer shall be submitted to the
Township Engineer for any retaining walls greater than
4 1/2 feet in height.
(c) Where concrete, stone or brick walls are used with side
slopes proposed to be steeper than three feet horizontal to
one foot vertical, the basin shall be fenced by a permanent
wire (or other material approved by the Township) fence
42 inches in height and a ramp constructed of durable,
nonslip material to a grade of less than 10% for
maintenance vehicles shall be provided for access into the
basin.
§ 26-307 FOREWORD § 26-307
FWD:805
(7) Width of Berm. The minimum top width of detention basin
berms shall be 10 feet. For shallow rain gardens or basins less
than two feet in depth, the minimum berm width shall be three
feet.
(8) Slope of Basin Bottom. In order to ensure proper drainage of
the detention basin, a minimum grade of 2% shall be
maintained for all basins used exclusively for peak runoff
control. Water quality or recharge basins with filtration
systems incorporated into them may have a minimum grade of
0%.
(9) The lowest floor elevation of any structure constructed within
50 feet of a detention basin or other stormwater facility shall
be two feet above the detention basin berm. The distance
between any residential structure and any stormwater facility
shall be a minimum of 50 feet. The distance between any
nonresidential structure and any stormwater facility shall be a
minimum of 25 feet.
(10) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for
all stormwater management basins and be specific for each
type of basin.
(11) Liners:
(a) Basins should be lined with impervious liners only in areas
with a high risk of sinkhole formation or potential
groundwater contamination as determined by a
geotechnical engineer. However, where a liner is deemed
necessary or appropriate, the use of controlled, compacted
natural clay liners for stormwater management basins
should be considered. Locally available clay, when
properly installed, can provide near impervious conditions
(approximately E-6 cm/s or less). Some of the advantages
of using controlled, compacted, natural clay soil liners are:
1) Can offer better long-term solution as a basin liner
versus geosynthetics because of greater thickness and
the ability to withstand settlement;
2) Can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage
rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an
excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock;
3) When properly constructed in two or more eight-toten-
inch-thick lifts, rapid movement of surface water
through the clay liner is eliminated (rapid leaks can
occur in geosynthetic-lined basins due to poor
seaming, punctures, or other factors);
§ 26-307 FERGUSON CODE § 26-307
FWD:806
4) Cleaning/maintenance of clay-lined stormwater basins
will be easier/safer versus geosynthetic liners which
could easily be damaged during maintenance
operations; and
5) The abundance of clayey soils (derived from limestone
residuum) within the Spring Creek Watershed can
provide adequate, cost effective, soil resources for
construction of clay liner systems at most
development projects.
(b) However, the installation of any low-permeability clay liner
system needs to be carefully controlled and the designer
needs to ensure that specifications meet standards to
ensure integrity. A quality control plan identifying the
specific clay source material and construction techniques
shall be submitted to the Township Engineer for approval
prior to the placement of the clay liner.
C. Construction of Basins.
(1) Basins shall be installed prior to or concurrent with any
earthmoving or land disturbances which they will serve. The
phasing of their construction shall be noted in the narrative
and on the plan. Basins that include water quality or recharge
components shall have those components installed in such a
manner as to not disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(2) Construction specifications in accordance with the minimum
criteria of the Township must be provided for all embankments
pursuant to this chapter.
(3) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to
the Township Engineer.
(4) A quality control program is critical for embankment fills.
Therefore, whenever embankment fill material in excess of
three feet is to be used, each layer of compacted fill shall be
tested to determine its density per ASTM 2922 or ASTM 3017.
The density of each layer shall be 98% of a Standard Proctor
Density analysis per ASTM 698.
(5) When rock is encountered during the excavation of a pond, it
shall be removed to an elevation of at least 12 inches below the
proposed basin floor (or 24 inches to 30 inches for a
manufactured liner. All exposed cracks and fissures are to be
structurally filled.
(6) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures
shall be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins
within 15 days of construction.
§ 26-307 FOREWORD § 26-307
FWD:807
(7) A minimum of six inches of topsoil material shall be placed on
all areas affected by the basin construction. The materials must
meet the requirements of PADOT Form 408 Specifications.
(8) All areas proposed for recreational use, whether active or
passive, shall be planted to effectively naturalize areas so as to
become an integral and harmonious part of the landscape by
contour and type of plant material employed.
(9) All disturbed areas shall be planted with grass in accordance
with PennDOT Form 408 Specifications.
(10) A fence or suitable vegetative screening may be provided, as
required by the Township, around all detention basins. All
fencing shall be at least 42 inches in height and the material
type is subject to approval by the Township. A vegetative
screening of suitable landscaping plant material in or around a
detention basin may also be required. Vegetative screenings
should generally provide a barrier to prevent entrance to, and
effectively naturalize the appearance of, the detention basin
area. Combinations of grassed areas and densely planted
shrub areas consisting of species suited to use in the highway
environment are encouraged. Species of raspberry (Rubus
spp.) are recommended.
D. Construction Inspection. Inspections may be conducted by the
Township Engineer during the construction of the stormwater
management basin and facilities. A preconstruction meeting
between the Township Engineer, owner, and owner's contractor is
required prior to any construction. Such inspections do not
constitute approval of construction methods or materials.
E. Special Use Basins.
(1) The design and construction of multiple-use stormwater
detention facilities are strongly encouraged. In addition to
stormwater management, facilities should, where appropriate,
allow for recreational uses including: ball fields, play areas,
picnic grounds, etc. Provision for permanent wet ponds with
stormwater management capabilities may also be appropriate.
Prior approval and consultation with the Township are
required before design. Multiple use basins should be
constructed so that potentially dangerous conditions are not
created. Water quality basins or recharge basins that are
designed for a slow release of water or other extended
detention ponds are not permitted for recreational uses, unless
the ponded areas are clearly separated and secure.
(2) Multiple Development Basins. Stormwater management
facilities designed to serve more than one property or
development in the same watershed are encouraged. Staged
construction of existing or proposed multiple-use detention
§ 26-307 FERGUSON CODE § 26-307
FWD:808
§ 26-308. Easements. [Ord. 1018, 6/6/2016]
facilities by several developers in conjunction with watershed
development is encouraged. Each developer shall be
responsible for the incremental increase in runoff generated
by the respective development and incremental construction
improvements necessary for the overall detention facility. Prior
approval and consultation with the Township is required before
design of such facilities.
(3) Alternative Detention Facilities: Alternative stormwater
detention facilities including rooftop, subsurface basins or
tanks and in-pipe detention storage, or other approved
alternative designs are permitted as determined by the
Township Engineer.
1. Stormwater management facilities located outside of existing or
proposed rights-of-way shall be located within and accessible by
easements as follows:
A. Drainage Easements. Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement paralleling the line of such watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream. The width of the drainage easement will be
adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage in the
one-hundred-year floodplain, in accordance with computed top
widths for water surface elevations determined under Part 3 of this
chapter.
B. Access Easements. Where proposed stormwater management
facilities are not adjacent to proposed or existing public rights-ofway
or are not accessible due to physical constraints, as
determined by the Township Engineer, a twenty-foot-wide passable
access easement specifying rights of entry shall be provided.
Access easements shall provide for vehicle ingress and egress on
grades of less than 10% for carrying out inspection or maintenance
activities.
C. Maintenance Easements. A maintenance easement shall be
provided which encompasses the stormwater facility and
appurtenances and provides for access for maintenance purposes.
The maintenance easement must be located outside of onehundred-
year surface elevation and the stormwater facility and
appurtenances.
D. Easements shall stipulate that no trees, shrubs, structures,
excavation or fill be placed and no regrading be performed within
the area of the easement without written approval from the
Township upon review by the Township Engineer. Upon approval of
the Township Engineer, such landscaping may be placed in
maintenance easements, provided it does not impede access.

E. Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel with and
conjunctive to property lines of the subdivision.
F. All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the plan. The format and content
of the easement agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the
Township Engineer and Solicitor.
G. When stormwater conveyance pipes or channels are located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within a drainage easement
not less than 20 feet wide as approved by the Township Engineer.

§ 27-101 FOREWORD § 27-104
FWD:839
relevant objectives and recommendations from the Centre Region
Comprehensive Plan, as amended, applicable to the purposes of this
chapter. These objectives are the basis upon which the regulations of
this chapter are established and are as follows:
A. Land Use and Character.
(1) Maintain a Regional Growth Boundary within which
development is encouraged and urban sprawl is minimized.
(2) Encourage enrollment in agricultural security areas and
participation in the Agricultural Conservation Easement
Program in the Township's rural and semirural areas.
(3) Establish municipal regulations that support agriculture as the
principal use on property outside the Regional Growth
Boundary that has prime agricultural soils.
(4) Minimize conflicts between productive agricultural areas and
urban land uses and discourage the parcelization and
conversion of large agricultural holdings into rural residential
parcels or urban uses.
(5) Use rural preservation techniques for developments outside
the Regional Growth Boundary.
(6) Designate rural centers planned for a mix of residential and
commercial uses to meet the needs of rural residents while
retaining rural character and lifestyles.
B. Land Development.
(1) Designate rural residential lands where low densities can be
sustained by infrastructure improvements, such as on-lot
septic systems, individual wells, and rural roads, without
significantly changing the rural character, degrading the
environment, or creating the necessity for urban services.
(2) Direct new residential development to sites within the
Regional Growth Boundary and Sewer Service Area to
facilitate convenient access to schools, jobs, medical facilities,
community services, shopping, and transportation routes.
(3) Consider retrofitting existing development to assure walkable
neighborhoods, a mix of residential densities, a strong sense of
place, and a mix of land uses, and consider the following points
in planning for and developing new projects: ensure compact
development plans, discourage sprawl, encourage infill, and
provide a range of housing opportunities and choices.
(4) Locate higher-density housing in areas zoned for intense
mixed-use development where commercial, civic, and
recreational opportunities are available.
§ 27-104 FERGUSON CODE § 27-104
FWD:840
(5) Encourage mixed-use development opportunities in
appropriately identified areas.
(6) Locate industrial development within the Regional Growth
Boundary in accordance with sound land planning principles
and the needs of industry.
(7) Encourage balancing the amount of commercially zoned
property with the needs of the Township and the greater
Centre Region.
(8) Identify and develop strategies to encourage redevelopment
and revitalization of under-utilized commercial properties
within the requirements of redevelopment authorities in
Pennsylvania.
C. Transportation.
(1) Recognize the close relationship between land use and
transportation impacts in actions related to zoning and land
development.
(2) Plan and implement transportation improvements and
investments in all modes that are appropriate to accommodate
future land uses identified.
(3) Consider the transportation system's capacity to accommodate
changes in travel demand when considering land use, zoning,
and proposed land development activities.
D. Resources and Sustainability.
(1) Encourage the preservation of prime agricultural soils and
farmland.
(2) Protect the high-quality surface and groundwater resources in
the Township.
(3) Avoid and mitigate negative impacts to endangered or
threatened species, key natural habitats, agricultural lands,
water resources, and historic and cultural resources.
(4) Support green infrastructure and open space techniques as the
principle paths for encouraging development that is responsive
to natural resource protection.
(5) Encourage future developments that take advantage of
existing infrastructure within the Regional Growth Boundary
and Sewer Service Area, such as transportation routes,
community services and facilities, or land use patterns while
minimizing land disturbance activities.
E. Economic Development.

corner lots and a line joining points on these street right-of-way
lines 25 feet from their intersection.
G. On a corner lot, the side yard abutting the street shall have a
setback area equal to the depth of the front yard setback area
required for the use and shall be governed by all front yard setback
requirements of this chapter.
H. On a through lot, the rear yard setback width shall be either the
rear or front yard setback width designated for the use, whichever
is greater.
I. Where a tract of land zoned rural agricultural on the effective date
of this Part 2, or thereafter, is changed to a different zoning
classification, then a buffer yard of not less than 50 feet in width
shall be provided on the property which has been rezoned when the
rezoned land adjoins land in the RA Rural Agricultural Zone.
(1) This revised buffer shall also be applicable to any acreage
which currently contains the previously established 200-foot
buffer and for which a final subdivision or land development
plan is approved after the effective date of this Part 2.
(a) The approval of such reduction in the buffer area for any
lot shall be contingent upon the agreement of all property
owners within the specific section or phase of development
of which the lot is a part. Any final plan submitted must
therefore include all such lots.
§ 27-209 FOREWORD § 27-209
FWD:859
(b) Acreage subject to the buffer but not previously
designated as a phase of an existing development will
require amendment of the approved master plan for that
development in order to modify the existing buffer
location.
(2) No structure, including decks, patios or building additions may
encroach in this fifty-foot buffer yard other than the placement
of an accessory structure/shed of less than 144 square feet,
which is permitted to be located within the buffer and as close
as three feet from the property line. Swimming pools shall be
prohibited from being located within the fifty-foot buffer yard.
(3) To ensure clear distinction between the land in the RA Zone
and the land zoned for development, the Board may require
that the developer of the nonagricultural land install either
fencing or landscaping along the entire length of the shared
boundary with the RA-zoned lands in addition to the
establishment of the fifty-foot buffer.
(a) Where a landscaped buffer is required by the Board, such
landscaping will be required to meet the requirements of
either the fifteen-foot buffer yard "B" or the thirty-foot
buffer yard "D." Once installed, this landscaping may not
be removed at any time by the present or future owner(s)
of the nonfarm lots. These owners will be responsible in
perpetuity for the continued maintenance and
replacement of the landscaping material located on their
property.
(b) At the discretion of the Board, the developer may be
responsible for the installation of a six-foot fence in lieu of
the above landscaping requirement. Such fencing shall be
installed along the entire length of the shared boundary
with the RA-zoned lands. The fencing may not be chainlink
and may not be removed at any time by the present or
future owner(s) of the nonfarm lots. In addition, unless a
homeowners' association is established, the individual lot
owners will be responsible in perpetuity for the continued
maintenance and if necessary, the replacement of that
portion of the fence on their property.
J. Where a tract of land zoned Rural Agricultural on the effective date
of this Part 2, or thereafter, is changed to a different zoning
classification, then a buffer yard of not less than 200 feet in width
shall be provided on the property which has been rezoned when the
rezoned land adjoins land in the (FG) Forest Gameland Zone.
K. In all zoning districts, the lot width may vary as long as the
minimum lot width at the street line and the building setback line
are in compliance.

(2) If over 40 feet in height, they shall not exceed a height equal to
their setback distance from any property line.
(3) They are not intended for human occupancy as dwellings.
B. Computation. The height of a structure shall be computed as the
vertical distance measured from the mean level of the ground
surrounding the structure to its highest point.
C. Single-Family Residential Structures in RA District. In the Rural
Agricultural District, the maximum height requirement shall not
apply to a single-family residential structure provided the following
conditions are satisfied:
(1) The structure in question shall be located on a lot having a
minimum size of 10 acres.
(2) The minimum front yard setback of the lot in question shall be

(3) The maximum height as measured from the finished grade at
the front elevation shall not exceed 40 feet in height.
(4) The overall maximum height of a single-family residential
structure in the Rural Agricultural Zoning District shall be
measured by calculating the mean height of the structure. This
calculation will subtract the final grade elevation of the front of
the structure from the final grade elevation of the rear of the
structure and divide the sum by two. This sum will be added to
the height of the structure at the front elevation of the
structure to determine the maximum height of the structure.
This mean height shall not exceed 115% of the height of the
single-family residential structure at the front elevation.
§ 27-210 FOREWORD § 27-210
FWD:861
(5) For the purposes of determining the height under this
exception, the "front elevation" shall be the side of the

proposed to be imposed upon the use of the land, buildings
or structures, including proposed easements or grants for
public utilities.
(c) A statement of the present ownership of all the land
included within the planned residential development and
the applicant's interest in the land proposed for
development. By definition, the PRD is required to be
developed as a single entity for a number of dwelling units
or combination of residential and nonresidential uses.
Therefore, if multiple owners wish to form a partnership in
order to pursue tentative approval of a PRD, a lot
consolidation plan will be required as a condition of
approval and must be completed prior to submission of the
pre-final design.
(d) The form of organization proposed to own and maintain
the common open space and whether public or private
ownership is proposed.
(e) A statement describing the proposed surface drainage of
the tract, proposed erosion and sediment control plan and
proposed sanitary sewage treatment system and water
service. Documentation shall be provided to support the
feasibility of the proposal for water supply, control of
stormwater, erosion and sediment control and for the
sanitary sewage treatment, including sewer authority and
public water authority ability and capacity to serve the
PRD.
(f) A traffic impact study as per the adopted Township
standards.
(3) For the purpose of reviewing the proposed development plan at
the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors meetings,
the applicant shall provide a digital version (.pdf or Townshipapproved
equivalent) of the submission.
(4) A phasing plan indicating:
(a) The date when construction of the project can be expected
to begin.
(b) The phases in which the project will be built and the date
when construction of each phase can be expected to begin
and end. The number and type of units to be developed in
each phase shall also be included. This schedule will be
updated every January.
(c) The development plan shall illustrate all items described in
§ 27-302, Subsection 1B(1)(a) through (i) above and

of all on-site and off-site improvements such as roadways,
storm drains and stormwater management shall be
illustrated.
(d) The area and location of common open space that will be
provided in each phase.
(e) The type and location of both active and passive recreation
areas that will be provided in each phase.
(5) Public Hearings.
(a) Within 60 days after the filing of an application for
tentative approval of a planned residential development
pursuant to this Part 3, a public hearing pursuant to public
notice on said application shall be held by the Board of
Supervisors for the enactment of an amendment to this
chapter. The Chairman, or, in his/her absence, the Vice
Chairman, of the Board of Supervisors may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
testimony by witnesses at any hearing shall be given under
oath and every party of record at a hearing shall have the
right to cross-examine adverse witnesses.
(b) Prior to the public hearing by the Board of Supervisors,
the Planning Commission shall consider the application
without the requirement of public notice and shall make its
recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. In the event
that the Planning Commission shall not have a complete
recommendation prior to the public hearing of the Board
of Supervisors referred to herein, the Board of Supervisors
may continue the public hearing as provided in this
chapter.
(c) A verbatim record of the public hearing shall be caused to
be made by the Board of Supervisors whenever such a
record is requested by any party to the proceedings, but
the cost of making and transcribing such a record and the
expense of the copies shall be borne by the party
requesting it. All exhibits accepted in evidence shall be
identified and duly preserved or, if not accepted in
evidence, shall be properly identified and the reason for
exclusion clearly noted in the record.
(d) The Board of Supervisors may continue the hearing from
time to time and may refer the matter back to the Planning
Commission for a report; provided, however, that in any
event the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded
within 60 days after the date of the first public hearing.
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:872
(e) Owners of all adjacent and adjoining properties including
any properties on the opposite side of any public right-ofway
which is adjacent to the property in question shall
individually receive written notice of the public hearing at
least two weeks prior to the date of the meeting.
(6) Findings of Fact.
(a) The Board of Supervisors, within 60 days following the
conclusion of the public hearing(s) provided for in this
section, shall by official written communication to the
landowner either:
1) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as
submitted.
2) Grant tentative approval subject to specified
conditions not included in the development plan as
submitted.
3) Deny tentative approval of the development plan.
Failure to do so within said period shall be deemed to
be a grant of tentative approval of the development
plan as submitted. In the event, however, that
tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the
landowner shall, within 30 days after receiving a copy
of the official written communication of the Board of
Supervisors, notify the Board of Supervisors of his/her
intent to accept or reject all said conditions. In the
event the landowner refuses to accept the conditions,
the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have
denied tentative approval of the development plan.
(b) The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written
communication shall include not only conclusions but also
findings of fact related to the specific proposal and shall
set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without
conditions, or for the denial and said communication shall
set forth with particular emphasis in what respects the
development plan would or would not be in the public
interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact and
conclusions on the following:
1) In those respects in which the development plan is or
is not consistent with the Centre Region
Comprehensive Plan for the development of the
Township and the Township's Park, Recreation and
Open Space Plan, when adopted.
2) The extent to which the development plan departs
from zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise
applicable to the subject property including, but not
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:873
limited to, density, bulk and use, and the reasons why
such departures are or are not deemed to be in the
public interest.
3) The purpose, location and amount of the common
open space in the planned residential development,
the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and
conservation of the common open space and the
adequacy of the amount and purpose of the common
open space as related to the proposed density and
type of residential development.
4) The physical design of the development plan and the
manner in which said design does or does not make
adequate provision for public services, vehicular
traffic control, and for amenities including light and
air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the
proposed planned residential development to the
larger neighborhood in which it is proposed to be
established.
6) In the case of a development plan which proposes
development over a period of years, the sufficiency of
the terms and conditions intended to protect the
interests of the public and of the residents of the
planned residential development in the integrity of the
development plan.
7) Whether the PRD removes from the former zoning
district an amount of area that would result in the
reduction in inventory of that district, thereby
decreasing the Township's ability to provide its fair
share in relation to the Zoning Map.
(c) In the event a development plan is granted tentative
approval, with or without conditions, the Board of
Supervisors may set forth in the official written
communication the time within which an application for
final approval of the development plan shall be filed, or, in
case a development plan provides for development over a
period of years, the periods of time within which
applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be
filed. Except upon the consent of the landowner, the time
so established between grant of tentative approval and an
application for final approval shall not be less than three
months and, in the case of developments over a period of
years, the time between applications for final approval of
each part of a plan shall not be less than 12 months.
(7) Status of Plan After Tentative Approval.
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:874
(a) The official written communication provided for in this
section shall be certified by the Township Secretary and
shall be filed in his/her office and a certified copy shall be
mailed to the landowner. Where tentative approval has
been granted, it shall be deemed an amendment to the
Zoning Map, effective upon final approval, and shall be
noted on the Zoning Map.
(b) Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify
the planned residential development for recording nor
authorize development or the issuance of any building
permits. A development plan which has been given
tentative approval with conditions of the tentative
approval as submitted or which has been given tentative
approval with conditions which have been accepted by the
landowner (and provided that the landowner has not
defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the tentative
approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise
impaired by action of the Township pending an application
or applications for final approval, without the consent of
the landowner, provided an application for final approval is
filed, or in the case of development over a period of years,
provided applications are filed within the periods of time
specified in the official written communication granting
tentative approval.
(c) Revisions to a Development Plan After Tentative Approval.
Any changes to the tentatively approved development plan
which are proposed prior to the pre-final or final plan
submittal shall be submitted to the Board of Supervisors
for consideration and determination as to whether or not
the changes are substantial enough to require a public
hearing prior to approval. If the Board of Supervisors
determines a public hearing is not required, the plan may
move to the final approval stage. If the Board of
Supervisors determines a public hearing is necessary, the
process outlined in § 27-302, Subsection 1B(5) and (6)
("Public Hearings" and "Findings of Fact") shall be
followed. If a public hearing is required to review the
revised plan, the applicant shall be responsible for
payment of the fee for the legal advertising notice. Upon
tentative approval, the applicant shall provide the
Township with three copies of the revised master plan.
(8) Pre-Final Design Submission. A development plan which has
been given tentative approval shall submit street, sanitary,
water and stormwater management site plans for the entire
development to be approved by the Township Engineer. The
plans shall include information sufficient for review and
approval of a pre-final design as required by the Township
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:875
ordinances for a preliminary subdivision plan. Approval of this
submission is required prior to any final plan submissions for
separate section(s) or the complete development. Review shall
be within 90 days of the submission or resubmission date. Prefinal
design submission must be reviewed and approved by
the Planner, Zoning Administrator, Fire Chief, water and sewer
provider and Township Engineer. The applicant must submit
evidence of approval from all other entities to the Township
prior to approval of this submission.
(9) Application for Final Design Approval.
(a) An application for final design approval may be for all of
the land included in the development plan or, for a specific
phase as set forth in the tentative development plan.
Application shall be made to the Board of Supervisors
within the time or times specified by the official written
communication granting tentative approval but not until
after the pre-final design submission has been approved.
Application for final design approval shall be accompanied
by:
1) Ten copies of the final plan, prepared or certified by a
registered engineer or surveyor in accordance with
Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land Development, and
this chapter showing the final location and widths of
all streets, the location of all buildings, parking areas,
pedestrianways, utilities, utility easements, lot lines,
the location and size of all open space not devoted to
parking lots, streets or driveways, the proposed use of
all lands and buildings and the metes and bounds of all
proposed dedicated areas and lots.
2) Restrictive covenants executed by all owners of the
premises within the section covered by the final plan
which, if approved, shall be recorded with the
Recorder of Deeds of Centre County. The restrictive
covenants shall be effective for a period of at least 35
years, except that covenants relating to stormwater
management facilities, parks, recreation and other
open space areas shall provide that the same remain
as such perpetually.
3) Any additional conditions set forth at the time of
tentative approval.
(b) A public hearing on an application for final approval of the
development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required
provided that the development, or part thereof, submitted
for final approval is in compliance with the development
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:876
plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any
specified conditions attached thereto.
(c) In the event the application for final approval has been
filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other
documents in support thereof and as required by this
section and the official written communication of tentative
approval, the Board of Supervisors shall, within 45 days of
such filing, grant such development plan final approval. At
the time of approval, the Board of Supervisors shall pass a
resolution to change the zoning of the final plan portion of
the property from its underlying zoning district to planned
residential development (PRD).
(d) In the event the final development plan as submitted
contains variations from the development plan given
tentative approval, the Board of Supervisors may refuse to
grant final approval and shall, within 45 days from the
filing of the application for final approval, so advise the
landowner, in writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said
notice the reasons why one or more said variations are not
in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the
landowner may either:
1) Refile his/her application for final approval without
the variations objected to.
2) File a written request with the Board of Supervisors
that it hold a public hearing on his/her application for
final approval.
(e) If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate
action he/she may do so at any time within which he shall
be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 30
additional days if the time for applying for final approval
shall have already passed at the time when the landowner
was advised that the development plan was not in
substantial compliance. In the event the landowner shall
fail to take either of these alternate actions within said
time, he/she shall be deemed to have abandoned the
development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for
the hearing is made by the landowner, and the hearing
shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this section
for public hearings on applications for tentative approval.
The applicant shall be responsible for payment of the fee
for placement of the legal notice to advertise the public
hearing. Within 30 days after the conclusion of the
hearing, the Board of Supervisors shall by official written
communication either grant final approval of the
development plan or deny final approval. The granting or
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:877
denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in
cases arising under this section, be in the form and contain
the findings required for an application for tentative
approval set forth in this section.
(f) Once all of the final plan approval conditions are met, with
the exception of posting financial surety, construction may
commence in accordance with Township road standards.
However, no lots or parcels may be transferred or sold
until financial surety is posted and the plan is recorded.
(g) A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been
given final approval shall be so certified without delay by
the Board of Supervisors and shall be filed on record
forthwith in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Centre
County, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 509
and 513(a) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code,90 together with any restrictive covenants and
agreements or other provisions which govern the use,
maintenance and continued protection of the planned
residential development and its common open space. Upon
the filing of record of the development plan, the zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the
land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto.
Pending completion, Section 508 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code91 and the Township final
subdivision regulations shall apply to said planned
residential development or that part thereof, as the case
may be, that has been finally approved. No modification of
the provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as
finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of
the landowner.
(h) Approval of a final plan may be subject to posting a
performance bond covering up to 110% of the cost of
developing common open spaces, planting plans, public
improvements and other improvements deemed
appropriate by the Board of Supervisors.
2. Use Regulations.
A. The following residential uses may be permitted in a planned
residential development: single-family, two-family, multifamily
detached, semidetached and attached dwellings, nursing homes,
personal care boarding homes, assisted living facilities, retirement
communities, other convalescent homes, community gardens, as
well as mixed-use buildings as defined herein. The appropriate
integration of these uses throughout the PRD will be considered in
90.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10509 and 10513(a).
91.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10508.
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:878
determining the acceptable type and amount of units as well as
the maximum square footage of units and/or development with
a health care element. Mixed-use structures are subject to the
square footage restrictions as provided below for all nonresidential
uses. They may include employment opportunities such as
professional office(s) or those related to the service industry as well
as civic uses in addition to a residential component.
B. The additional uses set forth in the following subsections may be
permitted where the Board of Supervisors deems that one or more
of them is appropriate to the neighborhood in which the planned
residential development is located. The definition of neighborhood
shall be agreed upon by the applicant and the Board of Supervisors
prior to the Board of Supervisors' action and shall be voted upon
considering planning principles based upon, but not limited to, the
following: 1) the proposed PRD area, 2) any adjacent, existing,
proposed, potential or tentatively approved PRD area(s), 3)
utilities, 4) building complexes, 5) topographic and natural
features, 6) population projections, 7) infrastructure capacity and
planned improvements, and 8) existing and proposed elements of
connectivity.
(1) Building gross floor areas (square feet) for nonresidential uses
shall not exceed 2% of the total acreage of the PRD. This
includes the total gross floor area of a neighborhood shopping
center and the gross floor area for the other nonresidential
uses within the proposed PRD combined. The nonresidential
square footage of a mixed-use building shall be calculated by
using the ground floor footprint only. Residential uses in such
structures shall not count toward the permitted density of the
PRD.
(2) Neighborhood Shopping Center.
(a) A neighborhood shopping center shall not exceed the total
gross floor area for the market area population of the
neighborhood as defined above. The market area
population is determined to be the daytime employment
and residential population of the neighborhood as defined
above. The neighborhood shopping center shall be
planned and operated as a single unit, in the context of the
PRD.
(b) For every 500 square feet of nonresidential floor area
proposed, 20 square feet of public space (not including
standard sidewalk dimensions) shall be provided. This
public space shall serve as a focal point and shall be
comprised of areas such as plazas, courtyards, walkways,
market squares, civic spaces and other such gathering
spaces. Although expected to be landscaped, these areas
may contain a substantial hardscape design element.
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:879
(c) Ground floor commercial uses shall provide the
opportunity for upper-story housing or office space over a
minimum of 30% of the square footage. Mixed-use
buildings shall not exceed three stories except through
conditional use approval which would permit up to five
stories in appropriate locations.
(d) The following uses are permitted within the
aforementioned neighborhood shopping center:
greenways; trails; arts and artisan studios; music, dance,
martial arts, or exercise studios; health clubs; fire/police/
emergency services facilities; transit facilities; eating and
licensed drinking establishments; bakery; butcher shop;
cafe; catering; coffee shop; delicatessen; neighborhood
grocer; neighborhood convenience store; ice cream and
confections; eating and drinking establishment (not
including drive-through service); diner; neighborhood
market/farm market; sale, service or rental of a limited
range of goods such as bookstore; florist; antique or gift
shop; apothecary/pharmacy (not including drive-through
service); jewelry; hardware; dry goods; clothing, toy, or
home accessories store; lighting; music store including
instruments and recordings; bikes; skateboards; skis;
exercise equipment; personal service shops; business and
professional offices such as barber; beautician; day care;
hair/nails salon or spa; home occupations and no-impact
home-based business; dry cleaning services;
administrative or financial offices (not including drivethrough
service); medical/dental offices; frame shop;
laundromat; shoe repair; tailor; phone store; accountant;
architect; attorney; or place of assembly.
(e) None of these uses shall, by reason of their location,
construction, manner or timing of operation, signs,
lighting, parking arrangements or other characteristics,
be permitted to have adverse effects on residential uses
within or adjoining the district or create traffic congestion
or hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Mixed-use
buildings, which contain any combination of the above
permitted uses, shall also be permitted within a
neighborhood shopping center. However, mixing of uses is
desired between and among individual lots within the PRD
as well as within structures. Mixed-use buildings that are
located in a predominantly residential context may be
setback in a manner that maintains general alignment with
the facades of other structures in the block.
(f) The sale of aircraft, boats, cars, heavy equipment, lumber
yard, maintenance equipment, and vehicles, together with
the servicing of vehicles is prohibited. Retail operations
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:880
that rely on a market area exceeding the larger
neighborhood of which the PRD is a part are prohibited as
is any form of drive-through service.
(g) Buildings which are designed for nonresidential or mixeduse
purposes shall have a minimum front setback of zero
feet and a maximum front setback of 20 feet. However,
such structures shall maintain a minimum of 65% of their
frontage along the sidewalk's edge (zero setback) and the
main pedestrian entrance shall be from this facade.
(h) The setback of these structures may be increased where
plazas, courts, or outdoor seating areas are proposed, as
long as sufficient pedestrian walkway width is retained.
Setbacks which provide for public space shall be usable
and shall include special amenities such as benches,
fountains, or sitting areas. Fabric awnings on commercial
or mixed use structures may encroach within the setback
or into the pedestrianway in instances where such feature
enhances the human scale of the pedestrian environment
or public space. All such extensions shall, however, be set
back a minimum of two feet from the face of curb. In no
instance shall the setback be extended to accommodate
parking.
(i) For all nonresidential structures, a minimum of 50% of the
front facade on the ground floor shall be transparent,
consisting of window or door openings allowing views into
and out of the interior. Blank walls along pedestrian routes
are discouraged. Where blank walls are established, a
landscaped border shall be provided between the wall and
the walkway. This border shall be between six feet and
eight feet in width and shall be designed to provide visual
interest and to screen the blank wall.
(j) In nonresidential, mixed-use, or multifamily areas, well-lit
walkways shall connect building entrances to the adjacent
public sidewalk and to associated parking areas. Walkways
shall be a minimum of five feet in width. Lighting shall be
pedestrian-oriented and provided at a level between 0.5
and 2.0 footcandles, dependent on the volume of both
pedestrian and vehicular traffic and the location of the
walkway in relation to intersections.
(k) Year-round screening of any utility apparatus appearing
above the surface of the ground shall be required unless
such apparatus is placed in a lane or alley. As a result, the
placement of aboveground utility structures should be
coordinated with the proposed landscape plans to ensure
that they are positioned away from key focal areas. The
visual impact of all rooftop mechanical equipment such as
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:881
vents, exhaust hoods, and antennas (including satellite
dishes and telecommunication facilities) shall be
minimized by integrating or screening such appurtenances
with the building design.
(l) Multiple nonresidential structures may be provided on a
single parcel, provided that each structure is separated by
a minimum of 20 feet and site amenities such as plazas,
courtyards, park space, greens, or other such facility are
incorporated to break up the massing of the structures.
Such amenities shall also feature benches, plantings,
fountains, or other element(s) that typically define a public
space.
(m) All dwelling units located within mixed-use buildings shall
be situated within 1,000 feet of a commons, square,
greenway, park or playground.
(n) All neighborhood shopping centers shall accommodate
transit service through provision of a stop or pull-off area
convenient to the pedestrian access for the stores or
offices or a universally accessible route to transit service if
located adjacent to the neighborhood shopping center. If
said service facility is on the lot, a shelter and seating with
lighting shall be provided.
(o) Bicycle parking is required to be provided for all
nonresidential, mixed-use, or multifamily land uses.
Bicycle parking spaces are to be located so as to be
convenient to the structure or use for which they are
provided and to be visible from at least one entrance.
Lighting shall be provided for all such bicycle parking
areas.
(3) Any area devoted to an industrial use shall not exceed 1% of
the total land area within the proposed PRD. Only the following
uses in this industrial context shall be permitted: research and
development, bakery, assembly of electrical appliances,
scientific and technical equipment, office buildings, limited
warehousing and storage. All storage of parts, equipment, etc.,
shall be located entirely within the main or accessory
structures. Industrial uses in a PRD shall be located adjacent to
an arterial or collector street. The range of uses listed above
are permitted only when:
(a) The underlying zone was nonresidential (C, I, IRD).
(b) The PRD is adjacent to a commercial, industrial or similar
nonresidential use that relates to the adjacent area. Where
applicable, the proposed location of the nonresidential use
shall be adjacent to neighboring nonresidential uses.
§ 27-302 FERGUSON CODE § 27-302
FWD:882
(4) The Board of Supervisors may also permit community civicand
faith-based or community-business-based places of
assembly to be developed within the PRD but outside of a
neighborhood shopping center, provided they are designed to
serve primarily the residents of the PRD and the larger
neighborhood and are compatibly and harmoniously
incorporated into the design of the planned residential
development. Such additional nonresidential uses shall not, by
reason of their location, construction, manner or timing of
operation, signs, lighting, parking arrangements or other
characteristics, have adverse effects on residential uses within
or adjoining the district, or create traffic congestion or hazards
to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
3. Area and Bulk Regulations.
A. In this Part 3, where the word "former" is used, said word shall
refer to the zoning classification of a parcel of land prior to its
having been zoned PRD (planned residential development) under
the provisions of this section.
B. The Board of Supervisors may permit reductions in the setback
requirements if it finds that, through the use of topography, siting
on the lot, or design, such building or buildings do not infringe
upon the privacy of adjacent, existing or potential structures,
provided that:
(1) Spacing shall be provided between buildings to ensure privacy
and sufficient light and air. Each development shall provide
reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units.
Fences, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used as
appropriate, for protection and aesthetic enhancement of
property, the privacy of its occupants, the screening of
objectionable views or uses and the reduction of noise within
the PRD tract, PRD sections and off site.
C. The proposed location and arrangement of structures shall not be
detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the
existing or prospective development of the neighborhood.
D. Utilities.
(1) Sanitary Sewage Disposal. PRDs. shall only be permitted in
areas designated for sewer service as identified in the Centre
Region Act 537 Plan, as amended. All requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA
DEP) shall be complied with.
(2) Water Supply. All PRDs shall connect to public water authority/
company mains. All water mains and laterals shall meet the
design and installation specifications of said water authority/
company.
§ 27-302 FOREWORD § 27-302
FWD:883
E. Impervious surface information shall be provided per section/phase
such that the total ground floor area of all buildings and structures
shall not exceed 30% of the total area of the PRD. Maximum
impervious surfaces shall not exceed 50% of the total area of the
PRD.
4. Residential Density.
A. In this section, where the word "former" is used, said word shall
refer to the zoning classification of a parcel of land prior to its

planned in relation to any existing or proposed public or
semipublic open space which adjoins or which is within 1,500
feet of the perimeter of the planned residential development.
B. All land shown on the final development plan as common open
space shall be conveyed in either of the following ways, at the
discretion of the Board of Supervisors:
(1) To the Township of Ferguson. The Township may accept or
reject all or part of the common open space in dedication.
(2) To an organization for the ownership and maintenance of the
common open space, which organization shall not be dissolved,
nor shall it dispose of the common open space, by sale or
otherwise, without first offering to dedicate same to the
Township of Ferguson.
(3) In any event, the common open space, after being approved on
the final land development plan, shall be used thereafter for no
other purpose than as specified on the final development plan.
6. Perimeter Requirements.
A. If topographical or other barriers do not provide adequate privacy
for existing uses adjacent to the planned residential development,
the Board of Supervisors may impose the following requirements:
(1) Structures located within 20 feet of the perimeter of a planned
residential development must be set back by a distance
sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent
existing uses.
(2) Structures located on the perimeter of the planned residential
development must be permanently screened if required by the
Board of Supervisors.
B. The above subsections are intended to provide adequate privacy to
the proposed structures and uses of the PRD from adjacent

final approval and the landowner abandons such plan or the section
thereof that has been finally approved, and so notifies the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, or, in the event the landowner shall fail to
commence and carry out the planned residential development
within such five years after final approval has been granted, no
development or further development shall take place on the
property included in the development plan until after the said
property is resubdivided and is reclassified by enactment of an
amendment to this chapter in the manner prescribed for such
amendments in Article VI of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.92
B. No changes may be made in the approved final development plan
during the construction of the planned residential development
plan except upon application to the appropriate agency under the
procedure provided below.
(1) Minor changes in the locating, siting and height of buildings,
structures and rearrangement of lots to not exceed a 10%
reduction of overall dwelling units of the finally approved plan
to follow the Township's lot consolidation procedure may be
approved by the Township after authorization by the Planning
Commission if required by engineering or other circumstances
not foreseen at the time the final development plan was
approved.
(2) All other changes in use, any rearrangement of lots, blocks and
building tracts, any changes in the provision of common open
spaces, and all other changes in the approved final
development plan must be made by the Board of Supervisors,
under the procedures authorized for final plan approval. No
amendments may be made to the approved final development
plan unless they are shown to be required by changes in
conditions that have occurred since the final development plan
was approved or by changes in the development policy of the
Township.
8. Additional Applicable Ordinances and Laws.

1. Overall Intent.
A. The intent of the adoption of these development regulations is to
sanction, promote, and facilitate the development of fully
integrated, mixed use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods in areas
of the Township that are most appropriate for this type or style of
development. The basis for such design influence is the desire to
minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, and environmental
degradation. These regulations, administered jointly with the
associated design manual found in Chapter 22, Subdivision and
Land Development, are designed to diversify and integrate land
uses within close proximity to each other and to provide for the
daily recreational and shopping needs of residents and those who
work within the Township. The combined application of these
standards is anticipated to produce sustainable, long-term
development which enhances the quality of life, and to ensure the
highest possible economic and social benefits for all residents.
B. Further, it is the intent of these standards, in conjunction with the
design manual (see Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land
Development), to encourage innovation and promote flexibility,
economy, and ingenuity in development and to be consistent with
the goals and objectives enumerated by the provisions of Article
VII-A of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).94 All such
development within the Township is intended to be designed as an
outgrowth or extension of existing development or urban infill. As a
result, the establishment of the TTD Zoning District is consistent
with the provisions of Section 702-A(1)(ii) of the MPC.95 The
application of flexible design standards and increases in the
permissible density of development which are specified below, are
dependent on the extent to which each proposal identifies the
ability to successfully achieve the goals enumerated herein.

traditional town development shall be up to 20 residential
units per acre, provided that the development exhibits
good project design, provides maximum open space, and
encourages pedestrian orientation and movement
throughout. In areas which are designed for community,
mixed-use, or commercial development, no density limit
will be applied. However, this acreage must be subtracted
from the overall acreage of the site when calculating the
permitted density.
(b) Required Density. While some phases of the development
may be less intensely developed than others, an average
minimum density of seven residential units per acre must
be maintained for development of the entire TTD or
associated mixed residential area. This calculation must
exclude any acreage which accommodates civic, mixed-

frontage on a cross street, this shall be considered as
a front yard and will be subject to the setback and
design requirements as set forth above. However, the
depth of sidewalk from back of curb may be
maintained at five feet along the cross street.
2) In the event that the side yard is adjacent to another
lot that fronts on West College Avenue, there will be
no required side yard setback and new buildings may
be constructed with a zero lot line.
3) In the event that the side yard is adjacent to a
structured parking facility, there will be no side yard
setback required and new buildings may be
constructed with a zero lot line.
4) In the event that the side yard abuts an alley which
coincides with the district boundary, this side yard
shall be established as a rear yard consistent with the
provisions for a rear yard as indicated below.
(b) Pavement to accommodate surface parking may not
encroach within the required setbacks.
(3) Rear Yard.
(a) On each lot there shall be a rear yard, the depth of which
shall be five feet. However, if the rear yard is adjacent to a
property with a single-family residential dwelling unit, or a
property outside of the TS District, a twelve-foot
landscaped buffer shall be provided at the property line
and shall constitute the required setback. Surface parking
may not encroach within the required setback.
1) The required buffer shall be composed of one canopy
tree or evergreen tree and 15 shrubs per 35 linear feet
of the lot line.
§ 27-304 FOREWORD § 27-304
FWD:913
(b) If the rear yard of a lot abuts an alley, whether in or out of
the district, a five-foot concrete sidewalk shall be provided
along the entire length of the property adjacent to the
alley. Buildings may directly abut this sidewalk. If the alley
coincides with the district boundary, the twelve-foot
landscaped buffer required above shall be provided in
addition to the five-foot sidewalk, establishing a total
seventeen-foot setback.
(4) Building Separation.
(a) All buildings built on a zero lot line shall be independent
and no structural wall may be shared by buildings on
adjacent lots. Buildings on the same lot may be connected
by enclosed walkways or covered walks.
E. Impervious Lot Coverage.

off-site, and remote or structured parking, or any combination
thereof.
(2) When an on-site surface parking area is proposed, it shall be
located underneath or to the side or rear of the structure(s) it
is intended to serve and shall have vehicular access from the
side or rear of the lot. On-site parking in the front yard is
specifically prohibited.
(3) When surface parking is located to the side of a structure, it
must be set back from the sidewalk edges a minimum of 10
feet. This additional setback shall be used to accommodate
screening composed of a low architectural wall, masonry piers,
fencing, or a combination thereof, and a continuous four-foot
high (at time of planting) shrub hedge that screens the parking
and defines the sidewalk edge. Additional deciduous and
evergreen trees may be used to supplement the required
plantings.
(4) Surface parking located to the side of a structure may not
extend to a side street. The corner lots are subject to the use
and yard requirements as stipulated above.

surface parking lot is 30. However, if acceptable pervious
paving is used for the entire parking area, this number may be
increased to 45.
(6) Parking areas shall be designed so as to optimize the potential
to serve more than one building or more than one use on a site
or adjoining sites as long as the location and design remain
consistent with the other criteria of this section.
(7) To be counted toward the minimum number of required
spaces, off-site parking must be located within two blocks or 1/
4 mile of the main entrance to the use that requires the spaces.
If the off-site spaces are not in a publicly owned and operated
parking structure, documentation of the reservation of such
spaces for each use must be provided in the form of a shared
parking agreement.
(8) Residential parking within the TS District shall be provided at
the rate of 1.0 space for each studio or one-bedroom unit and
§ 27-304 FOREWORD § 27-304
FWD:915
1.5 spaces for each unit that is two bedrooms or larger, subject
to the following criteria:
(a) To utilize this parking standard, all surface parking on the
site shall be priced separately from the cost of the unit.
Such fee structure would not be applicable to the use of
driveways, attached garages, or underground and
understructure parking spaces on-site but would be
applicable to the use of off-site parking spaces in a
structured parking facility.
(b) The use of incentives cannot reduce this required parking
ratio.
(9) Parking for nonresidential uses within the TS District shall be
provided at the rate of 1/500 square feet, subject to the
following criteria:
(a) Where shared parking can be arranged, the amount of
required parking shall be dictated in accordance with the
provisions of the ULI Shared Parking Handbook, Second
Edition (2005).
(b) Where either on- or off-site shared parking is utilized, an
agreement establishing the rights to use of the spaces
shall be prepared, submitted and, upon approval by the
Township, recorded.
(c) Additional reductions may be considered through the use
of incentives as listed elsewhere in this section.
(10) Every nonresidential use with a floor area of 10,000 square
feet or more must provide a loading/unloading area. Curbside
deliveries are permitted so long as they do not block travel
lanes.
(11) All uses shall provide bicycle parking accommodations on site.
See § 22-502, Subsection 3.
(12) All egress from a parking area shall be designed so that motor
vehicles leaving the parking area will enter the public street
traveling in a forward direction.
(13) All surface parking lots must be suitably landscaped to
minimize noise, glare, and other nuisance characteristics as
well as enhance the environment and ecology of the site and
surrounding area. At a minimum, all surface parking areas
shall be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of
§ 27-707, Subsection 14B and C and shall demonstrate that a
minimum of 5% of the internal surface parking area has been
devoted to landscaping area.

FWD:918
closed depressions, sinkholes, watercourses, floodplains,
steep slopes, archaeological sites, burial sites, wetlands,
solid waste disposal areas and topography of the site shall
be identified on the plan and any necessary approvals for
encroachment in these areas shall be obtained.
(i) The proposed general lot layout shall be shown on the plan
including the location of the various types of land uses and
approximate location of lot lines; building setback
measurements; the approximate location, use, height, and
bulk of buildings; the proposed units of occupancy and
resultant density calculation; the approximate location and
size of park space or public plazas; the approximate floor
space and general configuration of all nonresidential uses
and the provisions for access and parking.
(j) The general layout of any proposed streets, alleys, and

underlying zoning district maximum height by a ratio of one
foot or fraction thereof for each additional two feet or fraction
thereof of building setback which is provided from the corridor
ratio of 1:2 (example: an increase of five feet in height equals
an increase of 10 feet of the setback from the corridor).
D. Vehicular Access.
(1) Vehicular access for lot abutting corridor streets shall be
provided in the hierarchy as follows:
(a) First, access to the lot shall be through collector,
subcollector or residential access streets with limited
access from the corridor street. When the only available
access to the lot(s) is from the corridor street then the
provisions of this subsection shall not apply.
(b) Second, if feasible and in the best interest of traffic
operations, access shall be provided through an existing
shared common driveway which serves the adjacent lot or
lots.
(c) Third, by means of access points directly onto the corridor
street which existed prior to the enactment of this section,
provided that at the time of land development a reduction
of multiple access points is to occur with approval of the
Township and/or PennDOT when more than one access is
not in the best interest of acceptable traffic operations and
practices.
(d) Fourth, when the only available access to a lot is from the
corridor street, access shall be limited to not more than
one driveway for the first 300 feet of frontage and one
driveway for each additional 300 feet of frontage, unless
only one access is not in the best interest of acceptable
traffic operations.

materials as are used on the designated front of the building.
"Visible" is determined by anyone (as represented by the Township
Zoning Administrator) that is either a pedestrian and/or passenger
or driver of an average size vehicle on the corridor street or on side
assess streets. The elevation requirements of the land development
plan section are applicable to the sides of the building facing the
corridor street. Rooftop mechanical systems shall be screened by
fencing or other means at least 3/4 the height of the system.
H. Signage. Ground signage in the Corridor Overlay District shall be
installed in accordance with § 19-111.2 of the Sign Ordinance
(Chapter 19) and applied to all uses. The ground pole shall not
exceed 10 feet above grade except that the sign height is permitted
to be an additional three feet higher with a landscaped base
elevated with each mounding up to three feet tall. The placement of
building-mounted signs is permissible in accordance with the
applicable sections of the Sign Ordinance (Chapter 19) for the
relevant use.
I. Utilities. All new development along the Western Inner Loop and
Old Gatesburg Road from Science Park Road to Blue Course Drive

96.Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
§ 27-401 FOREWORD § 27-401
FWD:925
§ 27-402. Ridge Overlay District Requirements. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/
18/2019]
(1) The maximum height of the light fixture shall be 25 feet.
(2) Any outdoor lighting fixture newly installed or replaced shall
be shielded so it does not produce a strong, direct light over
adjacent property boundaries or produce a glare to motorists
along the arterial corridor.
1. The Ridge Overlay District requirements are intended to provide land
use and land use development controls along specified ridge corridors
in the Township as an overlay that is supplemental to the underlying
Rural Residential Zoning District regulations. If a conflict exists
between the regulations of this section and the underlying Rural
Residential Zoning District regulations, the more restrictive
requirements shall apply:
A. Intent. Many of the soils present in the overlay zone, including
some of those identified as colluvial, are rated by the Soil Survey of
Centre County as having severe limitations for uses such as septic
tank absorption fields, dwellings with basements, and local roads
and streets. The Soil Survey, prepared by the United States
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service, indicates
that a rating of severe means "soil properties are so unfavorable
and so difficult to correct or overcome as to require major soil
reclamation, special designs, or intensive maintenance." The
limitations associated with the colluvial soils include a seasonal
high-water table, fragipan, soil stability, steep slopes, slow
permeability, large stones, and frost action. It is the intent of the
Ridge Overlay District requirements set forth hereinafter to
restrict the intensity of development on areas containing a
predominance of colluvial soils with severe limitations, and 1) to
identify the location of the most severe soil areas where
development is not appropriate; 2) to minimize the potential for
damage from erosion, sedimentation and flooding; 3) to protect the
property of the Township and future homeowners from adverse
conditions; and 4) to protect and retain natural resources,
especially surface water and groundwater resources within the
Township.
B. Delineation of Ridge Overlay District. The Ridge Overlay District
requirements shall be applied in the areas depicted on the officially
adopted Zoning Map of Ferguson Township.
C. Criteria for Subdivision or Erection of Structures in Ridge Overlay
District. The following criteria will determine the ability to, and
establish the process for, the subdivision of land or erection of a
habitable structure in the Ridge Overlay Zoning District.
§ 27-401 FERGUSON CODE § 27-402
FWD:926
(1) Soils. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of a habitable structure, the installation of a
paved driveway, or construction of roads which are used for
access to a dwelling unit or units may occur on Andover,
Buchanan, Laidig or other soils defined as colluvial by the
Centre County Soil Survey and/or NRCS digital soil survey,
other than in accordance with the provisions of § 27-402,
Subsection 1C(2) through (10) below, or through the
conditional use process provided for in paragraphs § 27-402,
Subsection 1D through G which follow.
(a) Although the Centre County Soil Survey may be used as a
resource, extensive on-site soils investigation and testing
will be required to determine the actual soil distribution on
each site. Any property or site within the overlay district
mapped with or potentially containing severely rated
colluvial soils, or inclusions thereof, must be evaluated
prior to being permitted for the land disturbance activities
noted above. In order to accomplish the soils evaluation
work, the developer must meet with the Township's
Engineer to determine, at a minimum, the location,
number and type of soil test pits that will provide a
representative sample of the soils present within the area
intended to be disturbed, Consensus on the number of test
pits will be reached based on the landowner's development
intentions, soil mapping units delineated in the Centre
County Soil Survey and/or the NRCS digital soil survey, the
location of natural features on the site, and any previous
soil test results. This will provide the data necessary to
prepare a detailed soils map of the site that will allow the
applicant to determine the potential to provide roads,
driveways and/or structures in accordance with these
regulations. The purpose of requiring testing of each
parcel is to allow for consideration of the variety of
property sizes, the location of salient natural features, and
the full range of permitted development options. For those
properties or sites where the above required soils
investigation definitively indicates that the proposed land
disturbance activities will not be impacted by the location
of colluvial soils, the remainder of the requirements of this
district shall not be applicable.
1) No excavation or fill that will cause any slope to
become unstable; impose loads that may affect the
safety of structures or slopes; interfere with adequate
drainage for the site area and the drainage area of
land tributary to the site; obstruct, damage, or
adversely affect existing sewerage or drainage; cause
a stagnant pond of water to form; or cause erosion or
sedimentation shall be permitted.
§ 27-402 FOREWORD § 27-402
FWD:927
(2) Soils Mapping and Report. The actual testing and report
preparation must be completed by a qualified soil scientist or
registered professional geologist with the appropriate
experience in soil science interpretation, subject to approval
by the Township Engineer. The results must then be submitted
for review and approval by the Township's Engineer. This
municipal review will determine the adequacy of the testing as
well as the development potential/buildable area of the parcel.
It is recommended that the need for any federal and state
permits be investigated, and that such permits be obtained,
prior to moving forward with any development plans.
(3) Drainageway/Watercourse. No land disturbance which would
involve the construction of a habitable structure or the
installation of a paved driveway or construction of a road or
roads which are used for access to a dwelling unit or units may
occur within 100 feet of a defined drainageway. Some
drainageways may have the capacity to carry substantially
more runoff than others. Therefore, the required separation
distance may be reduced as the result of a hydrological
analysis of the characteristics of each specific site and/or the
issuance of appropriate state or federal permits associated
with the proposed development activity.
(4) Floodplain. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a dwelling unit or units may occur within 100 feet of
the edge of a floodplain or the floodplain conservation district
as defined by the flood hazard boundary map for Ferguson
Township prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration,
Federal Emergency Management Agency. This distance may be
reduced for areas where there is a minimum 5% rise between
the edge of the floodplain and the area of earth disturbance,
Where such reduction in distance is desired, information shall
be provided during the conditional use hearing to assure that
an adequate separation has been provided.
(5) Septic System Approval. As part of the soils testing for the
entire site, the testing for septic systems must be
accomplished. The septic systems must be approved by the
Township's Sewage Enforcement Officer in conformity with the
rules, policies, regulations and specifications of the
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
(6) Sinkholes. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a dwelling unit or units may occur within 50 feet of
the edge of a sinkhole. If there is a drainage path leading to the
§ 27-402 FERGUSON CODE § 27-402
FWD:928
sinkhole, a minimum of 50 feet on all sides of the drainage
channel shall be protected.
(7) Slope. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures or the installation of paved
driveways or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a dwelling unit or units shall occur within 100 feet
down grade of any area with a slope of 20% or more that is
primarily comprised of colluvial soils.
(8) Springs. No land disturbance which involves the construction
of habitable structures, the installation of paved driveways
and/or construction of a road or roads which are used for
access to a dwelling unit or units may occur within 100 feet of a
defined spring. This required separation distance may be
reduced as the result of a hydrological analysis of the
characteristics of each specific site and/or the issuance of
appropriate state or federal permits associated with the
proposed development activity.
(9) Wetlands. No land disturbance which would involve the
construction of habitable structures, the installation of paved
driveways and/or construction of a road or roads which are
used for access to a dwelling unit or units may occur within 50
feet of the edge of a defined wetland area as established by this
chapter, DEP, and/or the Army Corps of Engineers. This
distance may be reduced, if necessary; when the appropriate
permits from these state and federal agencies are obtained.
Where such reduction in separation distance is desired,
information shall be submitted during the conditional use
hearing that substantiates the need to reduce the separation
distance as well as the endorsement of the permitting
agencies.
(10) Subdivision. No new building lots may be created after the
date of enactment of this section which do not encompass
sufficient buildable area to comply with the applicable
provisions of § 27-402, Subsection 1C(3) through (9). The
buildable area shall be considered the same as the area of
potential land disturbance and includes the footprint of the
structure, the access, and the on-lot disposal system (OLDS) as
well as suitable land necessary to accommodate the required
OLDS replacement area. The subdivision plan for any lots
which are created must identify the location of all colluvial
soils within the proposed lot, as well as delineating that portion
of the lot which encompasses the buildable area. In addition, a
note must be placed on the plan which will alert future
homeowners to the potential for sinkholes, flooding and
drainage issues, as well as the possibility for development of
the lot to require special design or construction considerations
to mitigate the limitations imposed by the soils, Where
§ 27-402 FOREWORD § 27-402
FWD:929
sinkholes are included on acreage designated as part of a
newly subdivided lot, it is recommended that such areas be
fenced for safety.
(11) Existing wooded areas shall be protected to prevent
unnecessary destruction or removal of healthy trees with a
minimum trunk caliper of five inches at six inches above
ground. Where development is authorized in accordance with
Subsection 1C(2) through (10) above, or through the
conditional use process provided for in Subsection 1D through
G below, at least 40% of healthy trees on the site shall be
maintained or replaced immediately following construction.
Replacement trees shall be native species to Pennsylvania and
shall have a minimum trunk caliper of two inches at a height of
six inches above finished grade. Where significant removal of
trees within an existing wooded area is anticipated, plans shall
be required to be provided during the conditional use process
so as to demonstrate conformance with these criteria.
D. Conditional Use Requirements for Land Accessed Across Colluvial
Soils. In many cases, access to an area that is developable may not
be possible without crossing colluvial soils. In such cases, the
Board of Supervisors may grant a conditional use to cross the
colluvial soils if the following conditions can be satisfied:
(1) Access is not practical from another direction.
(2) Low impact driveway or roadway design, in accordance with
the associated PennDOT or other recognized standards
acceptable to the Township Engineer, is used.
(3) The proposed location and design of the access provides the
least practicable disturbance to the colluvial soils in the area.
(4) The access is located in conformance with the setback
restrictions associated with wetlands, floodplains, sinkholes,
springs, drainageways, and watercourses as referenced above
or, where such setbacks cannot be met, evidence that the
location and design of the access is not adversely impacted by
its proximity to such features is provided. The sufficiency of
evidence submitted shall be determined by the Board of
Supervisors depending on the specifics of each request.
E. Conditional Use Criteria for Existing Structures. Where existing
structures are located either wholly or in part on colluvial soils, the
Board of Supervisors may grant a conditional use to modify,
expand, or otherwise alter the structure (whether or not such
construction would also be located on areas of colluvial soils) if the
following conditions can be met:
§ 27-402 FERGUSON CODE § 27-402
FWD:930
(1) Certification as to the stability/structural integrity of the
existing structure is provided by a licensed, professional
engineer registered in the state of Pennsylvania.
(2) The proposed location and design of the expansion, alteration
or modification provides the least practicable disturbance to
the colluvial soils in the area.
(3) The design of the proposed structure modification has been
engineered to overcome the limiting properties of the soils by a
licensed, professional engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(4) Any increased maintenance required to ensure the longevity of
structural integrity of the design is identified and a written
maintenance plan is provided. A report from the design
engineer shall be provided to establish the necessity of regular
or specific maintenance.
(5) The construction is in conformity with the setback restrictions
associated with wetlands, floodplains, sinkholes, springs,
drainageways, and watercourses as referenced above or,
where such setbacks cannot be met, evidence that the location
and design of the proposed construction is not adversely
impacted by its proximity to such features is provided. The
sufficiency of evidence submitted shall be determined by the
Board of Supervisors depending on the specifics of each
request.
(6) The applicant shall provide a hold harmless agreement and
indemnification in favor of the Township for any damage that
may occur to the structure or any other private property as a
result of the presence of colluvial soils.
F. Conditional Use Criteria For Single-Family Dwelling. Where a
landowner desires to construct a single-family dwelling unit on an
existing lot that, as a result of these restrictions contains little or no
buildable area, the Board of Supervisors may grant a conditional
use if the landowner can establish the following:
(1) The property existed and was acquired prior to the date of
enactment of this section.
(2) There are no dwelling units currently existing on the site.
(3) Neither the area of land disturbance (which shall include the
footprint of the structure, the access, and the primary OLDS)
nor the impervious coverage shall exceed 50,000 square feet.
(4) The proposed location and design of the dwelling unit and
access provide the least practicable disturbance to the
colluvial soils in the area.
§ 27-402 FOREWORD § 27-402
FWD:931
(5) The proposal is consistent with the lot size requirement
specified for the Rural Residential Zoning District.
(6) The design of the proposed structure has been engineered to
overcome the limiting properties of the soils by a licensed,
professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
(7) Any increased maintenance required to ensure the longevity of
the structural integrity of the dwelling unit is identified and a
written maintenance plan is provided. A report from the design
engineer shall be provided to establish the necessity of regular
or specific maintenance.
(8) The proposed construction will occur in conformance with the
setback restrictions associated with wetlands, floodplains,
sinkholes, springs, drainageways, and watercourses as
referenced above or, where such setbacks cannot be met,
evidence that the location of such construction is not adversely
impacted by its proximity to such features is provided. The
sufficiency of evidence submitted shall be determined by the
Board of Supervisors depending on the specifics of each
request.
(9) The applicant shall provide a hold harmless agreement and
indemnification in favor of the Township for any damage that
may occur to the structure or any other private property as a
result of the presence of colluvial soils.
G. Conditional Use Criteria Where Restrictions Eliminate All
Development Potential on Existing Lots. Where the land
disturbance restrictions of this section result in the elimination of
all development potential for lots existing as of the date of the
enactment of this section, the Board of Supervisors may grant a
conditional use to allow the following uses as permitted in the
underlying Rural Residential Zoning District: 1) forestry uses; 2)
private passive park and recreational areas that do not include any
habitable structures; 3) horticultural and agricultural uses related
to the tilling of the land, the raising and propagation of crops, trees,
shrubs, flowers, fruits and vegetables, and other plant materials; or
4) public or private conservation areas for the conservation of open
space, water soil, and wildlife resources; subject to the following
conditions:
(1) The proposal is consistent with the lot size and bulk
regulations as specified in the Rural Residential District.
(2) The proposed use provides the least practicable disturbance to
the colluvial soils in the area.
(3) All resultant land disturbance conforms to the associated
setback restrictions as referenced above or, where such

FWD:932
§ 27-403. Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
setbacks cannot be met, evidence that the location of such
disturbance is not adversely impacted by its proximity to such
features is provided. The sufficiency of evidence submitted
shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors depending on
the specifics of each request.
1. Legislative Intent.
A. Under the authority of Article I, Section 27, of the Pennsylvania
Constitution, Act 247, the Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended, other commonwealth and federal statutes, and in
recognition of the fact that natural features contribute to the
welfare of residents, the following riparian buffer regulations are
enacted to provide reasonable controls governing the restoration,
conservation, disturbance, and management of existing riparian
corridors by establishing a designated Riparian Buffer Overlay
Zoning District.
B. Ferguson Township adoption of these regulations does not grant
public access to private property. Any grant of public access
remains the prerogative of each individual property owner.
C. The Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District ordinance, upon
adoption, shall apply to all subdivisions, land developments or
redevelopment of existing properties or any other improvements
that require subdivision or land development plan submission if
they are within or touch the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District
within Ferguson Township.
D. Any required riparian buffer preservation and maintenance shall
remain the sole responsibility of each individual property owner or
as otherwise stipulated by the Ferguson Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance.97
E. In addition, the specific purposes and intent of this section are to:
(1) Conserve the natural features important to land or water
resources (e.g., headwater areas, groundwater recharge
zones, floodways, floodplains, springs, streams, wetlands,
woodlands, prime wildlife habitats).
(2) Work with floodplain, steep slope, and other municipal
ordinances that regulate environmentally sensitive areas to
minimize hazards to life, property, and important riparian
features.
97.Editor's Note: See Ch. 26, Stormwater Management.
§ 27-402 FOREWORD § 27-403
FWD:933
(3) Conserve natural, scenic and recreation areas within and
adjacent to riparian areas for the Centre Region's benefit.
(4) Reduce the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter,
pesticides, and other harmful substances that reach
watercourses, wetlands, subsurface, and surface water bodies
by using scientifically proven processes including filtration,
deposition, absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, and
denitrification, and by stabilizing. Further, to minimize
concentrated flows through the use of level spreaders and/or
similar stormwater management devices used to disburse
concentrated flow uniformly over the ground as sheet flow.
(5) Improve and maintain the safety, reliability, and adequacy of
the Centre Region's water supply for domestic, agricultural,
commercial, industrial, and recreational uses along with
sustaining diverse populations of aquatic plants and animals.
(6) Regulate the land use, siting, and engineering of development
to be consistent with the intent and objectives of this section
and accepted conservation practices, as well assure that the
impacts of such development remain within the carrying
capacity of existing natural resources.
(7) Assist in the implementation of pertinent state laws concerning
erosion and sediment control practices, specifically erosion
control, of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law,98 Act 394, P.L.
1987, Chapter 102 of the Administrative Code (as amended
October 10, 1980, Act 157 P.L.), Title 25, and any subsequent
amendments thereto, as administered by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection and the Centre
County Conservation District.
2. Definition, Establishment, Width Determination, Applicability, and
Interpretation.
A. Definition.
(1) The Riparian Buffer Overlay is a zoning district consisting of
areas surrounding swales, creeks, streams, water bodies,
intermittent watercourses and delineated wetlands as well as
those encountered during subdivision and land development.
These areas intercept surface water runoff, subsurface flow,
and deep groundwater flows from upland sources and remove
or buffer the impact of nutrients, sediment, organic matter,
pesticides, or other pollutants prior to entry into surface
waters.
B. Establishment.
98.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
§ 27-403 FERGUSON CODE § 27-403
FWD:934
(1) The establishment of a Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District
applies to the following areas which are identified on the
officially adopted Zoning Map of Ferguson Township:
(a) Lands adjacent to streams within Ferguson Township.
(b) Lands adjacent to intermittent watercourses within
Ferguson Township.
(c) Lands, water bodies and wetlands as regulated by state
and/or federal designation.
(d) Similar land and/or water to those outlined above as
encountered during the process of subdivision and land
development within Ferguson Township.
C. Width Determination.
(1) The Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District shall extend a
minimum total width of 100 feet from each edge of any
perennial watercourse or surface water body, or shall equal the
extent of the 100-year floodplain, whichever is greater. Where
the edge of waterway of an intermittent watercourse cannot be
determined, the width of the Buffer Overlay Zoning District
shall be measured beginning from the center line of the
channel. The district may consist of two distinct zones
designated as:
(a) Zone One.
1) This zone will begin at the edge of the waterway
(including wetlands and intermittent watercourses)
and occupy a margin of land with a minimum width of
35 feet measured horizontally on a line perpendicular
to the edge of the waterway. Where a defined bed and
bank exist, the edge shall be established based on
bank full flow. The width of Zone One may be required
to extend beyond the minimum 35 feet depending
upon existing topography, woodlands, and other
natural conditions. This determination will be made by
the Township Arborist and/or Township Zoning
Administrator.
2) Where slopes of 15% or greater are located within the
thirty-five-foot Zone One, this zone shall extend the
entire distance of the steep sloped area. If the
distance of this sloped area is greater than 100 feet,
there will be no requirement for the establishment of
additional buffer area designated as Zone Two. If the
distance is less than 100 feet, but greater than 35 feet,
the sixty-five-foot wide Zone Two will begin at the end
of Zone One.
§ 27-403 FOREWORD § 27-403
FWD:935
(b) Zone Two. This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone
One and occupy a minimum width of 65 feet in addition to
Zone One (unless otherwise noted).
1) Where the floodplain extends greater than 100 feet
from the waterway, Zone One shall remain a minimum
of 35 feet wide, and Zone Two shall extend from the
outer edge of Zone One to the outer edge of the
defined 100-year floodplain.
2) As per § 27-701, Subsection 3I of this chapter, an
additional fifty-foot buffer shall be provided between
the edge of a FEMA-defined floodplain and any
proposed use on the site. The land within this 50 feet
shall remain in its natural condition.
(2) The Overlay Zoning District shall also include a minimum
buffer width of 50 feet around the entire perimeter of the outer
edge of wetlands and water bodies greater than 5,000 square
feet in area and not located along a stream.
D. Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply as follows:
(1) The developer/applicant shall be responsible for identifying the
location of the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District
boundary on any plan that is submitted to Ferguson Township
for the following:
(a) Subdivision, land development or redevelopment. [See
§ 27-403, Subsection 2H(1)(a).]
(b) Approval for improvements that require a zoning and
building permit. [See § 27-403, Subsection 2H(1)(b).]
Although mitigation may not be required for such activity,
the boundary must still be delineated.
1) In the overlay district, such permit shall only be
required when construction or erection of any
structure(s) within or touching the Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zones of Ferguson Township is located on the
ground or attached to something on the ground and is
greater than 144 square feet in size.
(2) This initial delineation of the overlay district boundary shall be
subject to review and approval by the Ferguson Township
Zoning Administrator and/or Engineer.
(3) These requirements shall not apply to any existing (as of May
18, 2009) primary or accessory buildings or to any of the
following: agricultural uses, transportation facilities, fences,
lawns, gardens, utility lines, decks and piers, or to interior
renovations, septic and essential services.

FWD:936
E. Interpretation of Ordinance Provisions. In interpreting the
language of the Riparian Buffer Overlay District and the extent of
underlying zoning district regulation upon use of property, where
doubt exists between regulations, the stricter regulation shall
govern. Any challenges to municipal interpretation of the
applicability of the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District shall be
appealed in accordance with the requirements outlined § 27-403,
Subsection 2K, Boundary Interpretation and Appeals Procedure,
and Article IX, Zoning Hearing Board and Other Administrative
Proceedings, of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act 247,
as amended.99
F. Uses Permitted in the Riparian Buffer Overlay District. The
following uses are permitted, either by right or as a conditional use,
in the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District. (NOTE: Within any
riparian buffer, no construction, development, use, activity or
encroachment shall be permitted unless the activity has been first
authorized by the Township Zoning Administrator.)

H. Management of the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District.
(1) Riparian Buffer Management. No development activities shall
be permitted within the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning
District unless specifically permitted by this section. All such
activities are subject to the following:
(a) Subdivision and Land Development. Within the Riparian
Buffer Overlay Zoning District, subdivision, land
development or redevelopment shall only be permitted
when the impacts of such actions are mitigated at a 1:1
square foot replacement ratio. The applicant shall prepare
and submit a plan in accordance with the provisions of
Appendix C108 and Chapter 22 of the Code of Ordinances,
that identifies the existing conditions (vegetation,
floodplain, wetlands, soils, slopes, etc.), all proposed
activities including any measures necessary to offset
disturbances to land within the Riparian Buffer Overlay
Zoning District and, if applicable, any proposed
management techniques following the guidelines for
restoration improvements identified in this section,
Appendix C, Riparian Buffer Management Plan.
1) Any earth disturbance within the Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zoning District shall follow the guidelines for
improvements identified in Appendix C, Riparian
Buffer Management Plan,109 and shall be graphically
represented along with any required buffers on formal
subdivision or land development plan submissions.
Where there is no disturbance within the buffer, no
mitigation is required. However, the location of the
Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District boundary
must still be delineated on the plan.
2) Lots where the Buffer Overlay Zoning District
consumes 50% or more of the lot shall be exempted

FWD:941
from the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District
requirements if the following criteria are met:
a) As of May 18, 2009, the lot is developed and such
development is already located within the area of
Zones One and/or Two.
b) As of May 18, 2009, the lot is two acres or less in
size.
3) For lots that are exempted per above:
a) Any redevelopment of the lot shall be required to
comply with the regulations associated with the
disturbance of any Nolin soils located on the site
as well as all applicable floodplain regulations.
b) Where the boundaries of Zone One fall completely
within an area designated as either floodplain or
Nolin soils, the overlay zoning requirements shall
remain in effect for this area of the parcel.
c) The above criteria shall not adversely impact any
nonconforming rights associated with use of the
parcel.
(b) Zoning and Building Permits. For activities that only
require a zoning and/or building permit and include
improvements within the Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning
District, riparian buffer replacement or restoration is
recommended only. If provided, the buffer should be at a
1:1 square foot replacement ratio for all disturbances,
following the guidelines for restoration improvements
identified in this section and Appendix C, Riparian Buffer
Management Plan.110
1) Projects for which mitigation is only recommended
and for which a buffer is provided shall identify the
existing conditions (vegetation, floodplain, wetlands,
soils, slopes, etc.), all proposed activities and, if
applicable, any proposed management techniques,
including any measures necessary to offset
disturbances to land within the Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zoning District.
(2) Vegetation Selection.
(a) To function properly, dominant native vegetation in the
riparian buffer should be selected from the list of native
plants most suited to riparian areas (Appendix D, Selective
110. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 27-403 FERGUSON CODE § 27-403
FWD:942
Native Buffer Planting List,111 Morris Arboretum of the
University of Pennsylvania). Plants not included on this
list may also be permitted by the Township Arborist. The
Township may also require that the suitability of planting
species be verified by local qualified experts at the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the Natural Resource
Conservation Service, the Centre County Conservation
District, the Pennsylvania State Cooperative Extension
and/or Clearwater Conservancy, or other state and federal
forest agencies.
(b) As part of riparian buffer restoration, it is required that
any/all noxious species existing within the buffer area and/
or within the site be removed. Property owners and
developers should ensure that invasive species are
removed so as to not adversely impact any native species
planted and protected as part of the required riparian
buffer restoration. Please refer to Appendices D, G and
H.112
(c) For maximum effect, the riparian buffer should be
composed of three layers of vegetation or more.
1) Canopy and understory trees to form a tree canopy
particularly in Zone One.
2) Shrubs to support a dense, healthy and diverse
understory.
3) Grasses, sedges, flowering perennials and other
groundcover.
(d) General Recommendations for Riparian Buffer Plantings.
Canopy and understory trees should be 1 1/2 to 2 1/2
calipers in diameter at breast height, eight feet to 10 feet
tall at planting. Canopy trees should be planted a
minimum of 20 feet to 25 feet on center in staggered rows,
and understory trees should be planted a minimum of 15
feet on center, also in staggered rows. Shrubs should be
planted in between canopy and understory trees at a
minimum distance of between three feet and five feet
apart. Grasses, sedges, flowering perennials and
groundcovers should be planted one feet to three feet
apart.

L. Inspection of Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District.
(1) Lands within or adjacent to an identified Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zoning District will be inspected by the Township
Arborist when:
(a) A subdivision or land development plan is submitted.
(b) A zoning and/or building permit is requested.
(2) The Riparian Buffer Overlay Zoning District may also be
inspected periodically by the Township Arborist and/or Zoning
Administrator to determine compliance with required riparian
buffer restoration in accordance with recommendations for
improvements identified in this section and Appendix C,
Riparian Buffer Management Plan,113 or when excessive or
potentially problematic erosion, sedimentation, hazardous
trees or an unauthorized activity or structure is brought to the
attention of Ferguson Township officials.
1. Purpose. The purposes of this section are to create an airport district
overlay that considers safety issues around the facility now or formerly
known as the University Park Airport, regulate and restrict the heights
of constructed structures and objects of natural growth, create
appropriate zones, establish the boundaries thereof and provide for
changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones, create the
permitting process for use within said zones and provide for
enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process and
judicial review. If a conflict exists between the regulations of this
section and the underlying zoning district regulations, the more
restrictive requirements shall apply.
2. Relation to Other Zoning Districts. The Airport District Overlay shall
not modify the boundaries of any underlying zoning district. Where
applicable, the Airport District Overlay shall impose certain
requirements on land use and construction in addition to those
contained in the underlying zoning district.
3. Establishment of Airport Zones. There is hereby created and
established a Conical Surface Zone within the Airport Overlay, as
113. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 27-403 FOREWORD § 27-404
FWD:945
depicted in Appendix J114 and illustrated on the University Park Airport
Hazard Area Map.
4. Permit Applications. A zoning permit shall be required prior to the
erection, extension or alteration of any structure or portion thereof, or
to erect and maintain any object (natural or man-made), within the
conical surface. A zoning permit shall not be required prior to a change
in residential ownership nor prior to a change in residential tenants.
A. Prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, the Zoning
Administrator shall review the application for the permit to
determine if all other necessary government permits required by
state and federal laws have been obtained. Prior to applying for a
permit and at least 30 days prior to commencing the permitting
action, the applicant shall notify the Bureau of Aviation (BOA) by
submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of
the proposal. The Department's BOA response must be included
with the zoning permit application for it to be considered complete.
(1) If the Department's BOA returns a determination of
penetration of airspace, the applicant may seek a variance
from the regulations, as specified in § 27-404, Subsection 6,
below, by filing an appeal as prescribed in § 27-907.
B. No such zoning permit shall be required for normal maintenance
activities and minor repairs which do not constitute an erection,
extension or alteration as herein defined, or for any structure
permitted pursuant to § 27-206, Subsection 1C, of this chapter.
C. No such permit shall be granted by the Zoning Administrator for
any purpose except in compliance with the provisions of this
section or, upon appeal, in compliance with a decision of the Zoning
Hearing Board or the courts.
(1) Refer to § 27-902, Subsections 3 through 6, to find applications
for zoning permits.
5. Variance. Variance requests shall be made on the forms provided by the
Township and shall be in accordance with Section 910.2 of the
Municipalities Planning Code.115 In addition, all requests for a variance
shall include documentation in compliance with 14 CFR Part 77,
Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or replaced). Determinations
of whether to grant a variance will depend on the determinations made
by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to the effect of the proposal on
the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable air space. In particular, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider which of the following categories the FAA has placed the
proposed construction in:

FWD:946
§ 27-405. Source Water Protection Overlay District Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
A. No Objection. The subject construction/alteration is determined
not (to) exceed obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not
required to mitigate potential hazard.
B. Conditional Determination. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated.
C. Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable.
6. Use Restrictions. Airports and Landing Strips. All airports and landing
strips shall be site-selected, designed and constructed in accordance
with standards of the Federal Aviation Agency. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this section, no use shall be made of land or water
within this section in such a manner as to create electrical interference
with navigational signals or radio communications between the airport
and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport
lights and others, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create
bird strike hazards or otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing,
takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the University Park Airport
surface.
7. Preexisting Nonconforming Uses. All nonconforming uses are subject to
the provisions of § 27-803. In addition, the regulations prescribed by
the Airport Hazard Overlay District shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or
tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this
section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming
use. No nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to
grow higher, so as to increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming
use, once substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning
ordinance), may only be reestablished consistent with the provisions
herein.
8. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted
pursuant to the provisions of § 27-404, Subsection 5, may be
conditioned, according to the process described therein, to require the
owner of the structure or object of natural growth in question or the
person requesting the permit or variance to install, operate, and
maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure both
ground and air safety.
9. Violations and Penalties. Violations and penalties shall be subject to the
provisions of § 27-906.
10. Appeals. Appeals shall be made in accordance with the process
identified in § 27-907.
§ 27-404 FOREWORD § 27-405
FWD:947
1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of residents and the ecosystems of the Township,
provide protections for sources of public drinking water supplies, and
safeguard the future supply of safe and sustaining drinking water. The
designation of a Source Water Protection Overlay District, as provided
herein, and the regulation of activities within such Source Water
Protection Overlay District are intended to reduce the potential for
ground water and surface water contamination and minimize adverse
environmental impacts. The Source Water Protection Overlay District
further intends to:
A. Protect groundwater-based public and private water supply
sources within the Township from contamination.
B. Minimize the risk from spills, leaks and other discharges into
groundwater within the Source Water Protection Overlay District.
C. Manage land use activities that store, handle, and produce
hazardous materials or regulated substances which can
contaminate water supply sources through inadequate
management.
D. Encourage best management practices (BMP) to limit degradation
of groundwater and surface water quality.
E. Provide many of the source water protections that are set forth as
goals in the existing source water protection reports or plans
formulated by such entities as the State College Borough Water
Authority, Pennsylvania State University, Bellefonte Borough Water
Authority, College Township Water Authority, and any other private
water companies utilizing groundwater within the Township for
public consumption.
F. Update ordinance requirements periodically, taking into account
any new technologies or practices in agricultural operations. When
new technologies, farming practices, or development activities
could lead to unacceptable harm to people or our source water that
is scientifically plausible but uncertain, the Township shall take
actions to avoid or diminish that harm.
G. Help mitigate the impacts of a changing climate on the
groundwater and surface water resources within the Township by
defining the Source Water Protection Overlay District to be the
entire Township, thereby including the future southwest extension
of the Zone II area.
2. Statutory Authority. Section 1428 of the Federal Safe Drinking Water
Act Amendments of 1986116 requires the states to establish wellhead
protection programs to protect groundwater from contamination. In
Pennsylvania, the responsibilities for development and implementation
116. Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 300h-7.
§ 27-405 FERGUSON CODE § 27-405
FWD:948
of source water (wellhead) protection programs is shared between
water suppliers, the commonwealth, and local municipal governments.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP)
recognizes that, in Pennsylvania, DEP is responsible for regulating
water suppliers and discharges of contaminants. Pennsylvania DEP
also recognizes that it is the responsibility of local governments to
regulate land use. Ferguson Township is empowered to regulate land
use activities through the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
Act 247 of 1968, as amended, which provides authorization to the
Township to enact ordinances regulating development and land uses
to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare; provisions for safe,
reliable, and adequate water supply; considering current and future
water resources availability, uses, and limitations (including provisions
adequate to protect water supply sources).
3. Applicability.
A. These provisions apply to land uses located or proposed within the
area delineated as the Source Water Protection Overlay District,
and to those land uses on parcels located within a Source Water
Protection Overlay District.
B. To the extent otherwise permitted or regulated by federal, state
and/or county statutes and regulations, the owners and/or
occupiers of lots and tracts of land which are primarily utilized for
the purpose of single- or multifamily residential dwellings are
permitted to utilize and store fuels, hazardous chemicals,
pesticides, fertilizers, inflammable liquids and gases, and toxic and
regulated substances listed as part of this chapter in such
quantities and in such manner as is associated with normal and
responsible household use, and such limited authorization shall not
be deemed a regulated land use and activity for the purposes of this
chapter.
(1) For commercial and retail establishments that sell
prepackaged fuels, hazardous chemicals, pesticides,
fertilizers, inflammable liquids and gases, and toxic and
regulated substances packaged for home uses, these packaged
materials shall be exempt from the requirements of this
chapter.
C. Both existing and proposed agricultural operations and/or service
businesses defined under Section 3 shall be exempt from this
chapter, provided that individual farmers coordinate and
implement best management practices through conservation,
manure management, agricultural erosion and sedimentation, and
nutrient management plans and any other applicable county, state
or federal regulations.
D. On-site sewage disposal systems, both existing and proposed, must
participate and fulfill requirements outlined in the Regional Act
§ 27-405 FOREWORD § 27-405
FWD:949
537 Plan and comply with the Ferguson Township Chapter 18,
Sewers and Sewage Disposal, Part 5, Sewage Management
Program.
E. Silvicultural and timber harvesting operations and activities shall
comply with the commonwealth's Chapter 102 regulations for
erosion and sedimentation control and Chapter 105 permits for
wetlands and streams through the Centre County Conservation
District.
4. Establishment and Delineation of Source Water Protection Overlay
District and Wellhead Protection Zones. The "Source Water Protection
Overlay District" shall be defined as the entire area within the
boundaries of Ferguson Township as set forth on the map marked as
Appendix A117 and incorporated herein by reference thereto. Source
water protection zones have been established by the State College
Borough Water Authority under the Source Water Protection Report,
January 2007 (revised in May 2017), for Zones I and II, and the
Pennsylvania State University for Zone II. The Rock Springs Water
Company retains established well locations within western Ferguson
Township, as the Overlay Map includes a prescribed Zone I delineation
around the well site.
A. Zone I: A protective area immediately surrounding a public water
supply with a radius defined by the most recently adopted State
College Borough Water Authority Source Water Protection Report,
as amended:
(1) DeArmit Well Field: Wells 1, 2 & 3 = 400 feet.
(2) Wellfield #4 (Nixon): Wells 41, 43 & 53 = 400 feet.
(3) Wellfield #5 (Chestnut Ridge): Well 55 = 135 feet and Well 57
= 140 feet.
(4) Wellfield #7 (Kocher): Wells 71, 73 & 78 = 400 feet and Well 79
= 140 feet.
(5) Wellfields #1 and #3 (Thomas/Harter): No wells located within
Township boundary.
(6) Penn State University Wellfields: Well 28A = 400 feet and Well
37 = No radius.
(7) Rock Springs Water Company: 400 feet radius around existing
wells.
(a) Upon a well decommissioning by the water purveyor, the
prescribed radius shall no longer be in effect upon notice
of the water purveyor to Ferguson Township.

FWD:950
B. Zone II: The area encompassing the portion of the aquifer through
which water is diverted into a well and typically defined by DEP as
a 1/2 mile radius around a well unless a more detailed delineation
is conducted. Detailed delineation was conducted as part of the
State College Borough Water Authority under the Source Water
Protection Report, January 2007 (revised in May 2017), and
outlined as the Source Water Protection Overlay District in
Appendix A.118
C. Consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act,119 for all construction
permit applications accepted by the Department of Environmental
Protection after October 9, 1995, a water supplier who is
developing a community water system well, spring, or infiltration
gallery that is installed for a new system or as an expansion of an
existing system shall:
(1) Own or substantially control through a deed restriction, or
other methods acceptable to the Department, the Zone I
wellhead protection area in order to prohibit activities within
Zone I that may have a potential adverse impact on source
water quality or quantity.
(2) Discontinue the storage, use, or disposal of a potential
contaminant within the Zone I wellhead protection area unless
the chemical or material is used in the production or
treatment, or both, of drinking water.
(3) Eliminate the storage of liquid fossil fuel within the Zone I
wellhead protection area except for providing auxiliary power
to the public water system to ensure the uninterruption of
essential services during power failures or as a primary
heating source only when the use of natural gas or propane gas
is not a viable option.
(4) Construct any new and replacement liquid fossil fuel tanks that
are within the Zone I wellhead protection area aboveground
within the pump house or an enclosed, locked structure using
an impermeable secondary containment structure of greater
capacity than the fuel storage tank.
5. Boundary Interpretation.
A. Each application for a subdivision, land development, or zoning
permit required for a regulated land use and activity, Table 27-405,
Subsection 7B, containing land within the Source Water Protection
Overlay District shall be submitted in accordance with such other
applicable provisions of Ferguson Township ordinances. Any area
of the Source Water Protection Overlay District that falls within the

of such area or areas and identification of the impacted wellfield.
B. Any applicant seeking subdivision, land development or zoning
permit approval for a regulated land use and activity (Table 27-405,
Subsection 7B) in a source water protection zone shall have the
burden to present evidence of the boundaries of the District in the
area in question. This evidence must include applicable geographic
data with respect to the property and any other pertinent
documentation for consideration. The Township's qualified
professional and planning and zoning staff shall evaluate the
information and shall make determination regarding the
boundaries of lands within a particular source water protection
zone. This information shall include:
(1) All plans shall be on sheet sizes consistent with the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.120
(2) Proposed name or identifying title of project.
(3) Name and address of the landowner and developer of the
project site.
(4) Plan date and date of the latest revision to the plan, North
point, graphic scale and written scale. All plans shall be at a
scale of 100 feet to the inch.
(5) Total acreage and boundary lines of the project site and the
tract of land on which the project site is located.
(6) A location map, for the purpose of locating the project site to
be developed, at a minimum scale of 2,000 feet to the inch,
showing the relation of the tract to adjoining property and to
all highways, streets, Township boundaries, and other
identifiable landmarks existing within 1,000 feet of any part of
the tract of land on which the project site is proposed to be
developed. Map should also include source water protection
zones along with the most recent aerial photography.
6. Public water supplier review. Prior to the commencement of any
subdivision, land development or new regulated land uses and
activities, as outlined in Table 27-405, Subsection 7B, below, the
Ferguson Township Department of Planning and Zoning shall furnish a
copy of plans or proposed permit application information to public
water suppliers such as the State College Borough Water Authority, the
Pennsylvania State University, Borough of Bellefonte, or the Rock
Springs Water Company under the following requirements:
A. The owner/applicant shall submit all pertinent information to
demonstrate to the public water supplier the following:

SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
§ 27-701. Floodplain Conservation. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
1. All land and watercourses defined herein as floodplains shall be subject
to the following regulations regardless of the district regulations within
which such land and watercourses are located. The identified floodplain
area shall be: A) any areas of Ferguson Township subject to the
100-year flood, which is identified as Zone A (area of special flood
hazard) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) with the effective date of
May 4, 2009, and the accompanying maps or the most recent revision
thereof as issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study, and B) those areas designated as alluvial soils by the Soil Survey
of Centre County, Pennsylvania, prepared by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, dated 1981.
2. The AE Area/District (Flood Insurance Risk Zone) shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which 100-year-flood
elevations have been provided in the FIS.
3. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 100-yearflood
elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from federal, state or other acceptable sources
shall be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not
available, the elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a
point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest
the construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require
the applicant to determine the 100-year-flood elevation with detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers
or others of demonstrated qualification, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Township.
Where a difference exists between these two documents, the document
which delineates the greater area shall be used. Any changes to the
data contained in the Flood Insurance Study are subject to the approval
of the Federal Insurance Administration.
A. Intent. It is the intent of this section to preserve the natural
functions of floodplains, to protect life and property from the
hazards of flooding, to protect the waters of the Township and to
minimize the financial burdens which floods impose upon the
community. These purposes shall be advanced by preventing
certain uses and structures from locating in floodplains while
allowing others which will not 1) impede the flow of floodwaters, 2)
§ 27-701 FOREWORD § 27-701
FWD:989
present the hazard of pollution, erosion and sedimentation of
floodplains and watercourses, 3) result in increased surface runoff
and downstream flooding, and 4) impede the recharge of aquifers.
(1) Areas subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters shall
include a) all flood hazard areas indicated on the
aforementioned Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and b) the
following alluvial soil types indicated on the aforementioned
soil survey maps:
Symbol Name
At Atkins Silt Loam
Ba Basher Loam
Ca Carlisle Muck
Ch Chagrin Soils
DU Dunning Silty Clay Loam
LX Lindside Soils
Mm Melvin Silt Loam
No Nolin Silt Loam
Ph Philo Loam
Pk Philo and Atkins very stony
soil
Po Pope soils
(2) Natural drainage swales subject to periodic inundation by
runoff rather than floodwaters are also subject to the
floodplain conservation regulations. Such drainage swales are
identified as Nolin silt loam soils, soil symbol "No" on the
aforementioned soil survey maps.
B. Permitted Uses. Floodplains may be only used for the following,
provided such uses and structures do not conflict with the
limitations of Subsection 3C, below:
(1) The tilling of the land, the raising of crops, fruits and
vegetables and the raising and keeping of livestock and
poultry.
(2) Horticultural uses related to the raising, propagating and
selling of trees, shrubs, flowers and other plant materials.
(3) Forestry uses related to the harvesting of lumber products.
(4) Public and private conservation areas for the conservation of
open space, water, soil and wildlife resources.
§ 27-701 FERGUSON CODE § 27-701
FWD:990
(5) Retaining walls, flood retention dams, culverts and bridges as
permitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.
(6) Customary uses accessory to the above.
C. Use Limitations. Uses permitted in § 27-701, Subsection 3B are
limited as follows:
(1) All new construction or development (including substantial
improvements) are prohibited.
(2) Improvements or modifications to an existing structure shall
be permitted but they shall be elevated or floodproofed as
much as possible, provided that said improvements or
modifications involve a) less than 50% of the fair market value,
and b) less than 50% of the square footage as it existed on
March 8, 1984.
(3) All other uses whether temporary or permanent are prohibited
including, but not limited to, the following which are not
interpreted as being customary accessory uses: filling in of the
floodplain; sanitary landfill or dumping of any kind; fences
which impede, retard or change the direction of the flow of
water or catch or collect debris carried by such water; outdoor
storage of materials which are buoyant, flammable or
explosive; and on-site sewage disposal systems.
(4) Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream or
any watercourse, etc., within the Township, a permit shall be
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection,
Dams and Encroachment Division, as specified in the Dam
Safety and Encroachment Act, as amended.129 Further,
notification of the proposal shall be given to all affected
adjacent municipalities. Copies of such notifications shall be
forwarded to both the Federal Insurance Administration and
the Department of Community and Economic Development.
(a) Under no circumstances shall any use, activity and/or
development adversely affect the capacity of the channels
or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch or any
other drainage facility or system.
D. Zoning Permit. Prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall review the application for the permit to
determine if all other necessary government permits required by

determination has been made.
E. Land Development Plan Review. Any applicant for a zoning permit
who is engaging in land development (as that term is defined in
Chapter 22, Subdivision and Land Development) within a floodplain
or 100 feet therefrom shall submit, along with the application, a
land development plan as required in Part 10 of this chapter.
F. Conditional Use. Local alluvial soils, while not always displaying all
of the characteristics common to alluvial soils, may be subject to
periodic inundation or flooding. For this reason they shall be
considered an integral part of the floodplain network. However,
they may be exempted from the provisions of this section when it is
determined that, by use of proper engineering and conservation
practices, such conditional use will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent of this section and they are not within a watercourse,
drainageway channel or stream, or within the floodplain area of the
Flood Insurance Rate Map for Ferguson Township as prepared by
the Federal Insurance Administration. A conditional use may be a
use as permitted by the existing Township zoning district, where
the soils are found as previously listed and a floodplain does not
exist.
(1) In granting a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors shall:
(a) Consider that there is good and sufficient cause.
(b) Consider that failure to grant the conditional use will
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) Consider that the granting of the conditional use will:
1) Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited
increase in flood heights, additional threats to public
safety or extraordinary public expense.
2) Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimize the
public or conflict with any other applicable state or
local ordinances and regulations.
(2) Make sure that a conditional use shall involve only the least
modification necessary to provide relief.
(a) Attach whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it
considers necessary in order to protect the public health,
safety and welfare and to meet the intent of this section.

FWD:993
15) Sodium.
16) Sulfur and sulfur products.
17) Pesticides (including insecticides, fungicides and
rodenticides).
(f) Any residential dwelling.
(4) Whenever a conditional use is granted, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant, in writing, that:
(a) The granting of the conditional use may result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance.
(b) Such conditional uses may increase the risks to life and
property.
(5) A report of all conditional uses granted under this section
during the year shall be included in the annual report to the
Federal Insurance Administration.
(6) Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall
be designed and constructed so as to have the capability of
resisting the 100-year flood.
G. Wetlands. Areas subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters and/
or occurring without flooding shall include:
(1) All wetland locations mapped on Fish and Wildlife Service
National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Ferguson Township.

F. Where the plantings identified in § 27-707, Subsection 7A through
D, immediately above, would result in an inappropriate or
impractical design due to underground utilities, overhead wires or
other factors, the following substitutions may be made:
(1) Two understory trees 1 1/2 inch caliper may be substituted for
one canopy tree.
(2) Two evergreen trees may be substituted for one canopy tree.
(3) One evergreen tree may be substituted for five shrubs.
8. Use of Existing Vegetation.
A. Where an existing hedgerow or forested area is located within a
proposed buffer yard, the use of existing vegetation is strongly
encouraged to the extent that a suitable buffer will be provided.
One existing canopy tree of at least four-inch caliper may be
substituted for one new tree that is listed in Township's official
plant list. All changes to the existing hedgerow or forested area
must be approved by the Township Zoning Administrator and
Township Arborist with consultation from the Tree Commission.
§ 27-707 FERGUSON CODE § 27-707
FWD:1000
B. Any existing understory vegetation which is shown to be native and
noninvasive should counted toward the buffer yard planting
requirements.
C. In an area where the canopy trees will not allow for the planting
and growth of understory trees, four shrubs could be planted in lieu
of each required understory tree.
D. Prior to plan approval, the plan for tree and/or understory
vegetation substitution or removal of existing vegetation must be
approved by the Zoning Administrator and Arborist with
consultation for the Tree Commission.
9. Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Existing site vegetative tree
growth of four inches trunk diameter or larger is encouraged.
10. Use of Existing Features. Lots separated by a bona fide drainageway,
creekway or stream channel may not substitute such condition for a
portion of any corresponding buffer yard width.
11. Screening of Trash Collection and Storage Areas. All trash collection
and storage areas shall be screened from all adjoining properties and
streets with vegetative materials and/or fences of at least six feet in
height at the time of installation. Screening with chain-link fencing
shall not be acceptable.
12. Access and Visibility. No tree, shrub, fence, wall or similar item shall be
installed in the sight triangle of any corner, street intersection or
accessway intersecting a public right-of-way that would cause an
obstruction to visibility.
13. Corridor Overlay District. In addition to the requirements of § 27-401,
including the buffer yard options set forth in illustrations adopted as
part of this chapter and codified at the end of this section, any site
located within the Corridor Overlay Zoning District shall comply with
the following landscaped buffer yard requirements:
A. A landscaped buffer shall be required for all parking areas visible
from the corridor street. "Visible" is determined by anyone (as
represented by the Township Zoning Administrator) that is either a
pedestrian and/or passenger or driver of an average size vehicle on
the corridor street. The main purpose of this landscape buffer is to
screen parking lot views from the corridor street. The landscaped
buffer may be permitted within the required fifty-foot setback.
B. To provide flexibility in design of the landscaped buffer yard
between the off-street parking lot and the street located in the
corridor, one or more of the following landscape treatment options
shall be used. The type of canopy trees chosen shall be in
accordance with Township Resolution 2014-25 (Regulations and
Standards for Arbor Work) and Township Resolution 2015-29
§ 27-707 FOREWORD § 27-707
FWD:1001
(Approved List of Tree Species, Cultivars, and Hybrids for Street
and Park Planting). These treatment options include:
(1) A minimum ten-foot-wide landscaped strip shall be planted
with a minimum of one canopy tree or evergreen tree and 15
shrubs per 35 linear feet of frontage along the parking area
(excluding driveway openings) (Figure 1).
(2) A berm/earth mound, the top of which is at least two feet
higher than the elevation of the adjacent parking lot pavement.
The slope of the berm shall not exceed 25% (4:1) for lawn
areas. Berms planted with ground covers and shrubs may be
steeper. However, no slope shall exceed 50% (2:1). Berms shall
be graded to appear as naturalistic forms not causing any soil
erosion problems and planted with a minimum of one canopy
tree or evergreen tree and 15 shrubs per 35 linear feet of
frontage along the parking area (excluding driveway openings)
(Figure 2).
(3) A six-foot-wide landscaped embankment strip and a minimum
three feet grade drop from the required yard area into any
adjacent parking lot pavement. The resulting embankment
shall be planted with a minimum of one canopy tree or
evergreen tree and 15 shrubs per 35 linear feet of frontage
along the parking area (excluding driveway openings). At least
50% of the required shrubs shall be planted in the top half of
the grade drop area (Figure 3).
(4) A minimum of a five-foot-wide landscaped strip with a
minimum three feet high brick, stone or finished concrete
material wall to screen any parking lot. The wall shall be
located adjacent to, but entirely outside, the minimum fivefoot-
wide landscaping strip. The strip shall be planted with a
minimum of one canopy tree or evergreen tree and 15 shrubs
per 35 linear foot of frontage along the parking area (excluding
driveway openings) (Figure 4).
(5) A minimum twenty-five-foot-wide strip of existing woodlands or
tree growth of sufficient trunk diameter or caliper of six inches
if preserved between any parking lot or buildings and the
corridor street (Figure 5).
(6) For display areas consisting of a parking lot that will be used to
display products for sale or rent such as cars, trucks, boats and
recreational vehicles, the following buffer yard may be used:
(a) A landscaped planting strip shall be planted with a
minimum of one canopy tree for every 50 feet of frontage
along the display parking area. Each tree shall have a
landscaped planting bed around its base. In addition, each
end of the display area shall include a planting bed/mound
which includes one canopy tree and 10 shrubs (Figure 6).
§ 27-707 FERGUSON CODE § 27-707
FWD:1002
As required but this chapter, a certain number of plants
shall be planted per 35 linear feet. Within the specified
length, the plantings may be staggered and do not have to
be planted in a linear fashion.
(b) The placement/configuration of much shall reflect best
practices in horticultural and landscape maintenance
standards, including but not limited to no placing of
materials to be a minimum of two inches of mulch and not
to create a formation indicative of a mulch volcano.
C. Flexible Buffer Yard.
(1) Purpose. Flexible buffer yards are intended to aid the Township
of Ferguson in protecting the community character of the
Township by separating incompatible uses either within the
same zoning district and/or between adjacent zoning districts.
The purpose of the flexible buffer yard requirements is to
alleviate problems which could be encountered by a single
standard. The requirements of this section can reasonably
accommodate the characteristics of each site and the range of
land uses.
(2) Procedure. The following procedure shall be used to determine
the type of buffer yard required between two uses located on
separate but abutting parcels:
(a) Step One. Identify the land use classification of the
proposed use and of all existing uses located on separate
§ 27-707 FOREWORD § 27-707
FWD:1003
adjoining lots by referring to the land use intensity
classification chart as follows:
Land Use Intensity Classification Chart
Group I
Agricultural
Single-family detached residential use(s)
Nonagricultural residential lot
Stormwater detention basin
Group II
Townhouses, multifamily housing, duplexes, quadplexes
Neighborhood civic-, business- or faith-based place of
assembly
Community civic-, business- or faith-based place of
assembly
Group III
All uses not identified in Group I or II
(b) Step Two. Determine the buffer yard required between
uses by referring to the following:
1) Buffer yards shall include a required width of 15 feet
and a minimum of three canopy trees and four
understory trees/evergreen trees per every 100 linear
feet of distance along a site's perimeter. Areas less
than 100 linear feet and/or fractions thereof are to be
landscaped with the corresponding ratio by 100 linear
feet, rounded up to the nearest whole plant.
2) Within the required three-foot side yard setback of the
Village District only, the Board of Supervisors may
approve the use of a fence or wall in place of the buffer
yard which would satisfy the buffer yard requirements
as defined above. When landscaping is being provided
to buffer against a different use group than is on the
site, the required plant material must be evenly
distributed within each 100-foot section of the buffer
area. The even distribution of plantings is intended to
screen objectionable views. When landscaping is
being provided to buffer against the same use group
as exists on the site, the required plant material may
be grouped or unevenly distributed within each
100-foot section of the buffer area.
§ 27-707 FERGUSON CODE § 27-707
FWD:1004
(c) Step Three. Determine the planting stock to be used as
landscape materials for the buffer yard in question by
referring to the Township's official plant list.
D. Placement of Buffer Yard Width. The landscaped buffer yard area
shall be established along the length of, and contiguous to, any lot
line or demarcation of land use, such as a leasable area. The width
of the area determined from buffer yard of this section shall be
measured at right angles to the lot line of the applicant's land
development.
14. Interior and Exterior Parking Lot Landscaping.
A. All parking lots shall meet the location requirements stipulated in
Chapter 22. All raised yards surrounding the parking lot shall be
bordered by a curb six inches high along the sides of the yard area
abutting the parking lot, including spaces and aisles. Where the
yards are not raised, separate stops shall be provided at the end of
each parking space abutting the yards. Where walkways terminate
at curbs, ramps shall be provided. Setback areas shall be planted
with grass or similar vegetative material and may include shrubs,
fences or walls.
B. Planting areas shall be installed at the end of all parking bays
abutting an aisle or driveway. The planting areas shall be bordered
by a curb four inches high wherever it abuts a space or aisle, and
shall be at least nine feet wide and extend the length of the parking
space and/or bay. Each planting area shall be planted with a
combination of suitable ground covers and/or grass and a minimum
of one canopy tree.
C. Utility poles and light standards are permitted within the planting
areas, provided they are separated from the spaces and aisles as
required by Chapter 22. Utility poles and light standards are also
permitted within the parking lot, provided the pole is surrounded
on all sides by a six-inch concrete curb. The back of the curb must
be a minimum of three feet away from the edge of the pole. No
poles are permitted within a required parking space or drive aisle.
D. When parking bays incorporate more than 10 parking spaces in a
continuous row, a raised island shall be incorporated within the
parking bay for every 10 parking spaces. The raised island shall be
bordered by a curb four inches high minimum wherever it abuts a
space or aisle and shall be nine feet wide and extend the length of
the parking space and/or bay. Each raised island shall be planted
with a combination of suitable ground covers and/or grass and a
minimum of one canopy tree. Wherever a building adjoins a
parking lot perimeter, islands shall be required. At the discretion of
the Board of Supervisors, the required ratio of landscaped islands
shall be maintained, but may be exceeded in some lot areas to one
island for every 12 parking spaces where lot configuration and/or
§ 27-707 FOREWORD § 27-707
FWD:1005
§ 27-708. Motor Vehicle Access. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
See Ferguson Township Subdivision and Land Development.134
§ 27-709. Sidewalks. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
See Ferguson Township Subdivision and Land Development.135
site constraints exist that would make it unreasonable to install a
raised island for every 10 parking spaces.
E. In order to provide flexibility in design, reduce heat, glare and
visual expansiveness, the following option may be considered in
conjunction with interior landscaped islands: provision of a
continuous landscaped strip between every four bays of parking in
lots that contain eight or more bays in one area. The strip shall be a
minimum of 15 feet wide and shall include a vehicle overhang of
2 1/2 feet when parking spaces are adjacent to the strip. The stall
length with the overhang strip may be reduced to 16 feet. The strip
shall contain a landscaped area of 10 feet minimum width and shall
be planted with shade trees at a ratio of at least one tree for every
40 feet of the strip length inclusive of driveway widths. These trees
shall be planted no less than 25 feet nor greater than 40 feet apart.
A combination of suitable ground covers and/or grass shall cover
the remainder of the strip. If the landscaped strip provides direct
access to a building entrance, a minimum five-foot wide sidewalk
shall also be included in the strip. In this event, the landscaped
strip will be required to be 20 feet in width, with the sidewalk in the
middle of the strip. The required trees can then be planted
alternately on each side of the sidewalk at the required distance.
F. In the event an existing parking lot is being enlarged or revised,
these regulations will apply only to the new section of the parking
lot.
15. Commercial District Planting Requirements.
A. In the C District, the off-street parking located within the front yard
setback area shall be provided with a twelve-foot-wide buffer yard
between the parking lot and property line fronting any street rightof-
way.
B. The planting shall provide shade and a view restrictive screen for
parking areas. For evening uses, the screen is intended to function
to block headlight glare affecting vehicles off site. Headlights of
parked vehicles must be obscured from the public right-of-way.
C. No tree, fence, wall or similar item shall be installed in the sight
triangle of any corner, street intersection or accessway intersecting
a public right-of-way that would cause an obstruction to visibility.

FWD:1006
§ 27-710. Wireless Communications Facilities. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/
18/2019]
1. Intent. The wireless communications facilities (WCF) regulations are
intended to achieve the following:
A. To provide a competitive and wide range of communications
services.
B. To encourage the shared use of existing communication towers,
buildings and structures.
C. To ensure compliance with federal and state regulations.
D. To promote the health, safety and welfare of Township residents
and businesses with respect to wireless communications facilities.
E. To address modern and developing technologies including, but not
limited to, distributed antenna systems, data collection units, cable
Wi-Fi and other communications facilities.
F. To establish procedures for design, siting, construction,
installation, maintenance and removal of both tower-based and
non-tower-based wireless communications facilities in the
Township, including facilities both inside and outside of the public
rights-of-way.
G. To protect Township residents and businesses from potential
adverse impacts of wireless communications facilities and
preserve, to the extent permitted under law, the visual character of
established communities and the natural beauty of the landscape.
2. General Requirements for All Tower-Based Wireless Communications
Facilities. The following regulations shall apply to all tower-based
wireless communications facilities:
A. Standard of Care. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed,
constructed, operated, maintained, repaired, modified and
removed in strict compliance with all current applicable technical,
safety, and safety-related codes including, but not limited to, the
most recent editions of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) Code, National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical
Code, as well as the accepted and responsible workmanlike
industry practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors.
Any tower-based WCF shall at all times be kept and maintained in
good condition, order and repair by qualified maintenance and
construction personnel, so that the same shall not endanger the life
of any person or any property in the Township.
B. Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be designed to
withstand the effects of wind according to the standard designed by
135. Editor's Note: See Ch. 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 27-710 FOREWORD § 27-710
FWD:1007
the ANSI as prepared by the engineering departments of the
Electronics Industry Association, and Telecommunications Industry
(ANSFEINTIA-222-E Code, as amended).
C. Height. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed at the minimum
functional height and shall not exceed a maximum total height of
200 feet, or 40 feet when located within the ROW, which height
shall include all subsequent additions or alterations. Height shall
be measured from the average natural grade to the top point of the
communications tower or antenna, whichever is greater. All towerbased
WCF applicants must submit documentation to the Township
justifying the total height of the structure. Tower-based WCF
constructed outside the ROW at a height greater than 200 feet but
not to exceed 300 feet shall be permitted as a conditional use in the
RA, AR, RR, C, FG, I and IRD Districts by the Board of Supervisors if
the following criteria are met:
(1) The applicant shall provide documentation to the Township
which details the commitment to provide capacity on the
proposed tower-based WCF to more than one provider. The
document must describe the additional tower height that is
required to provide the capacity to the additional provider(s).
The document shall also show that by providing the additional
height and capacity, there will not be a need from the involved
companies for an additional tower outside the ROW within a
radius of one mile of the site. The burden of proof shall be on
the applicant to show that the proposed tower is the minimum
height needed to provide the required service.
(2) The applicant shall provide documentation to the Township
that the height limitation of 200 feet will require the
construction of two or more towers and that by permitting an
increase in the height of the tower, only one tower will be
required. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show
that the proposed tower is the minimum height needed to
provide the required services. The purpose of this conditional
use is to permit an increase in the height of one tower to
reduce the need for additional towers.
D. Public Safety Communications. No tower-based WCF shall
interfere with public safety communications or the reception of
broadband, television, radio or other communication services
enjoyed by occupants of nearby properties.
E. Maintenance. The following maintenance requirements shall apply:
(1) Any tower-based WCF shall be fully automated and unattended
on a daily basis and shall be visited only for maintenance or
emergency repair, except as permitted and in accordance this
section.
§ 27-710 FERGUSON CODE § 27-710
FWD:1008
(2) Such maintenance shall be performed to ensure the upkeep of
the facility in order to promote the safety and security of the
Township's residents.
(3) All maintenance and activities shall utilize the best available
technology for preventing failures and accidents.
F. Radio Frequency Emissions. No tower-based WCF may, by itself or
in conjunction with other WCF, generate radio frequency emissions
in excess of the standards and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) including, but not limited to,
the FCC Office of Engineering Technology Bulletin 65 entitled
"Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure
to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields," as amended. The
applicant shall provide, upon request, a statement from a qualified
licensed and professional registered engineer that the non-ionizing
electromagnetic radiation (NIER) emitted from the tower-based
WCF, when measured in conjunction with the emissions from all
communications antenna on the tower, does not result in an
exposure at any point on or outside such facility which exceeds the
lowest applicable exposure standards established by the FCC or
the ANSI.
G. Historic Buildings or Districts. No tower-based WCF may be
located on or within 200 feet of a site that is listed on an historic
register, a site listed for inclusion on the historic register, or in an
officially designated state or federal historic district.
H. Identification. All tower-based WCF shall post a notice in a readily
visible location identifying the name and phone number of a party
to contact in the event of an emergency, subject to approval by the
Township. The notice shall not exceed two square feet in gross
surface area and shall maintain the contact party.
I. Lighting. Tower-based WCF shall not be artificially lighted, except
as required by the Federal Aviation Administration and as may be
approved by the Township. If lighting is required, the applicant
shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting, demonstrating
as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under
state and federal regulations. No flag shall be located on the
structure that requires lighting.
J. Appearance. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rustpreventive
paint of an appropriate color as determined by the
Township Planning and Zoning Director to harmonize with the
surroundings.
K. Noise. Tower-based WCF shall be operated and maintained so as
not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
state law and Chapter 10, Part 3, of the Ferguson Township Code of
Ordinances, except in emergency situations requiring the use of a
§ 27-710 FOREWORD § 27-710
FWD:1009
backup generator, where such noise standards may be exceeded on
a temporary basis only.
L. Aviation Safety. Tower-based WCF shall comply with all federal and
state laws and regulations concerning aviation safety.
M. Retention of Experts. The Township may hire any consultant(s) and/
or expert(s) necessary to assist the Township in reviewing and
evaluating the application for approval of the tower-based WCF
and, once approved, in reviewing and evaluating any potential
violations of the terms and conditions of this section. The applicant
and/or owner of the WCF shall reimburse the Township for all costs
of the Township's consultant(s) in providing expert evaluation and
consultation in connection with these activities.
N. Timing of Approval. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an
application for a tower-based WCF is filed with the Township, the
Township shall notify the applicant, in writing, of any information
that may be required to complete such application. All complete
applications for tower-based WCF shall be acted upon within 150
days of the receipt of a fully completed application for the approval
of such tower-based WCF, and the Township shall advise the
applicant, in writing, of its decision. If additional information is
requested by the Township to complete an application, the time
required by the applicant to provide the information shall not be
counted toward the 150-day review period.
O. Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming tower-based WCF which are
hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason or cause may be
repaired and restored at their former location, but must otherwise
comply with the terms and conditions of this section. Co-location of
facilities may be permitted on nonconforming structures in
accordance with standards established in the Pennsylvania
Wireless Broadband Collocation Act.136
P. Removal. In the event that use of a tower-based WCF is planned to
be discontinued, the owner shall provide written notice to the
Township of its intent to discontinue use and the date when the use
shall be discontinued. Unused or abandoned WCF or portions of
WCF shall be removed as follows:
(1) All unused or abandoned tower-based WCF and accessory
facilities shall be removed within six months of the cessation of
operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by
the Township.
(2) If the WCF and/or accessory facility is not removed within six
months of the cessation of operations at a site, or within any
longer period approved by the Township, the WCF and
accessory facilities and equipment may be removed by the
136. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 11702.1 et seq.
§ 27-710 FERGUSON CODE § 27-710
FWD:1010
Township and the cost of removal assessed against the owner
of the WCF.
(3) Any unused portions of tower-based WCF, including antennas,
shall be removed within six months of the time of cessation of
operations. The Township must approve all replacements of
portions of a tower-based WCF previously removed.
Q. Application Fees. The Township may assess appropriate and
reasonable application fees directly related to the Township's
actual costs in reviewing and processing the application for
approval of a tower-based WCF, as well as related inspection,
monitoring and related costs.
3. Tower-Based Wireless Communications Facilities Outside the Rights-of-
Way. The following regulations shall apply to tower-based wireless
communications facilities located outside of the right-of-way (ROW):
A. Permitted Only in Certain Zones. No tower-based WCF shall be
permitted within 500 feet of the nearest adjoining property line.
Tower-based WCF shall only be permitted as designated in zoning
districts as identified within the chapter.
B. Evidence of Need. It is required that the applicant for the
placement of a tower-based WCF that will exceed 40 feet in height
shall submit to Ferguson Township evidence of the need for the
tower-based WCF in the proposed location and that the applicant
has exhausted all alternatives to locate on an existing tower or
structure (co-location). In addition, the applicant must demonstrate
via written evidence from a qualified, licensed, and professional
engineer that, in terms of location and construction, there are no
existing towers, tower-based WCF, buildings, structures, elevated
tanks or similar uses able to provide the platform for the antenna
within a one-mile radius of the chosen location, unless the applicant
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township that a different
distance is more reasonable. Co-location is not possible if:
(1) Coverage diagrams and technical reports demonstrate that colocation
on an existing tower-based WCF is not technically
possible in order to serve the desired need.
(2) Planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
existing towers within the Township, considering existing and
planned use of those towers and existing towers cannot be
reinforced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment
at a reasonable cost.
(3) Planned equipment will cause radio frequency (RF)
interference with other existing or planned equipment for that
tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
§ 27-710 FOREWORD § 27-710
FWD:1011
(4) Existing or approved towers do not have the space on which
planned equipment can be placed so it can function effectively
and at least in parity with other similar equipment in place or
planned.
(5) Other reasons can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Township that make it impractical to place the equipment
planned by the applicant on existing and approved towers.
C. Sole Use on a Lot. A tower-based WCF is permitted as the sole use
on a lot subject to the minimum lot size and setbacks complying
with the requirements of the applicable zoning district.
D. Combined with Another Use. A tower-based WCF may be permitted
on a property with an existing use or on a vacant parcel in
combination with another agricultural, industrial, commercial, or
municipal use, subject to the following conditions:
(1) The existing use on the property may be any permitted use in
the applicable zoning district and need not be affiliated with
the communications facility.
(2) Minimum Lot Area. The minimum lot shall comply with the
requirements for the applicable zoning district and shall be the
area needed to accommodate the tower-based WCF, the
communications facility building, security fence, and buffer
planting.
(3) Minimum Setbacks. The tower-based WCF and accompanying
communications facility building shall comply with the
requirements for the applicable zoning district, provided that
no tower-based WCF shall be located within 500 feet of the
nearest adjoining property line.
E. Notice. Upon receipt of a letter of a complete application by the
Township for a tower-based WCF, the applicant shall mail notice
thereof to the owner or owners of every property within 500 radial
feet of the parcel or property of the proposed facility. The applicant
shall provide the Township with evidence that the notice was
mailed out to applicable property owners.
F. Design and Construction.
(1) The WCF shall employ the most current stealth technology
available in an effort to appropriately blend into the
surrounding environment and minimize aesthetic impact. The
application of the stealth technology chosen by the WCF
applicant shall be subject to the approval of the Township.
(2) To the extent permissible under applicable law, any height
extensions to an existing tower-based WCF shall require prior
approval of the Township. The Township reserves the right to
§ 27-710 FERGUSON CODE § 27-710
FWD:1012
deny such requests based upon aesthetic and land use impact,
or any other lawful considerations related to the character of
the Township.
(3) Any proposed tower-based WCF shall be designed structurally,
electrically, and in all respects to accommodate both the WCF
applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two
additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at
least one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height.
Tower-based WCF must be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept
antennas mounted at various heights.
(4) Guy wires are not permitted. The monopole must be selfsupporting.
G. Surrounding Environs. A soil report complying with the standards
of Appendix I: Geotechnical Investigations, ANSI/EIA/TIA-222-G
Manual, as amended, shall be submitted to the Township to
document and verify design specifications of the foundation for the
tower-based WCF.
H. Fence/Screen.
(1) A security fence of approved design, of not less than eight feet
in height and no greater than 10 feet in height, shall
completely enclose the tower-based WCF. The fencing required
in must also have a one-foot barbed arm slanted at a 45° angle
which runs along the entire top of the fence.
(2) The applicant shall submit a landscaping plan. Sites in which
communications towers are located shall be required to comply
with the following landscape requirements:
(a) Landscaping, consisting of evergreen plantings which

into conformity with this chapter as soon as constitutionally permissible. To
achieve this end, nonconformities are subject to the regulations set forth in
this Part 8.
§ 27-802. Nonconforming Lots of Record. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/

single-family detached dwelling and customary accessory uses may be
erected on any single nonconforming lot of record at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this chapter. This provision shall apply
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area and/or
width that are applicable in the district; provided, that all other yard
dimensions and requirements of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for single-family detached dwellings in the Single-Family Residential
District. Such nonconforming lot must be in separate ownership and not
abut other lots under the same ownership.
2. If two or more abutting lots or combinations of abutting lots and
portions of lots under the same ownership are of record and not in
conformity at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if
all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot
width or area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purposes of this chapter and no portion of said parcels be
used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width or
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this chapter. This subsection shall only apply
when neither of the lots involved, which abut each other, contains a
building. This subsection shall not apply to lots which are conforming to
the zoning in effect as of the time of passage of this chapter.

expanded to include abutting lots under the same ownership.
4. To uphold the long-established character and the district purpose of the
Township's Rural Agriculture Zoning District, for any lot in the Rural
Agriculture District between the acreage of 2.01 acres and 49.99 as

this chapter or subsequent amendment thereto, becomes
nonconforming, such use or structure may be continued as long as it
remains otherwise lawful, including subsequent sales of the property,
subject to the following provisions:
A. The existing nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different
nonconforming use.
B. No such nonconforming use or structure shall be altered or
extended except if such complies with the following criteria and
standards:
(1) To provide for a natural expansion which is not detrimental to
public health, safety and general welfare, provided such
expansion does not exceed 50% of the existing ground floor
area of the structure or other space occupied by the use.
(2) Provided such does not constitute the addition of a new
nonconforming use or structure.
(3) Provided such does not decrease yards when such already fail
to meet minimum yard setback areas.
(4) Provided that the alteration or extension meets the district
regulations for such use or structure as if same were being
altered or extended in the district where such use is permitted.
In cases where the use is permitted in two or more districts,
the most restrictive district regulations shall apply.
C. In the event that any nonconforming structure is destroyed or
partially destroyed by any means to an extent of 75% or more of the
market valuation of all structures and other improvements on the
lot, as determined to be the fair market value as of the date of
destruction, pursuant to an appraisal by a professional real estate
appraiser licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and
selected by the Board of Supervisors; such nonconforming
structure and use thereof shall terminate and the lot shall
thereafter be used only for conforming uses and structures, except
if the use or structure is a farm use as herein defined. Essential
services are exempt from the provisions of this subsection.
D. When a nonconforming use or structure is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of one year or more continuously, or
replaced by a conforming use or structure, the premises shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the

owner.
§ 27-805. New Construction. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require
a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure on
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on

herein defined.
E. Provided that the requirements of § 27-803, Subsection 1B(1)
through (4), are satisfied, a landowner need not obtain a variance
prior to altering or extending a nonconforming structure if such
alteration/extension would extend the nonconformity but not
aggravate it. In such cases, the landowner would be required to
obtain a fee zoning permit. An example of the type of alteration
permitted by zoning permit pursuant to this subsection is as
follows: a twenty-foot front yard setback requirement exists and
the structure is already constructed two feet into the setback. The
landowner proposes an addition to the nonconforming part of the
structure which would continue along the line of that portion of the
structure which is two feet into the setback.

6. Additional Information. The Planning Commission and the Board of
Supervisors reserve the right to request additional information as part
of the rezoning review and approval process in order to evaluate the
applicability of the rezoning.
1. Eligibility. The site must be zoned TTD, be located within the Regional
Growth Boundary and within a planned public service area. Public
sewer and water must not only serve the site, but sufficient capacity
must also be available.
A. The site proposed for development shall be under single ownership
and shall be developed according to a single master plan that
depicts build-out of the site with common authority and
responsibility.
§ 27-903 FOREWORD § 27-904
FWD:1077
2. Approvals. Any TTD proposal within the zoning district shall follow the
procedures outlined below which shall include each of the following
steps:
A. Initial conference.
B. General master plan.
C. Specific implementation plan.
3. Initial Conference. A traditional town development or mixed residential
area involves the creation of a coordinated and comprehensive plan for
a site as well as its integration with surrounding development. To
ensure that each submission addresses site development from this
perspective, an applicant shall meet with Township Planning and
Zoning Department staff for an initial conference prior to final
preparation and/or submission of a general master plan for approval. At
the initial conference, the applicant should be prepared to present, at a
minimum, plans which represent the required evaluation of open space,
the design for transportation, and utilities for the specific site as
required by § 27-303, Subsection 3A, B, and C, of this Part 9. In
addition, the applicant shall prepare a narrative which details the
design pattern and/or innovative design concepts proposed; an
explanation of how this approach will preserve natural features and
existing amenities of the site as well as protecting scenic vistas; the
structure or organization anticipated to be necessary to maintain public
areas and/or common open space; and the expected development
schedule for the project including any phasing associated with the
build-out of the plan. Other issues for discussion at this stage of the
review may include the design proposal's ability to satisfactorily
address specific elements of the TTD criteria related to pedestrian
generation and streetscape design; community building and the
development of community focal points and destinations; the
consideration of the environmental context of the site and the resultant
design provisions; and the ability of the applicant to comprehend and
ultimately implement the TTD concepts as envisioned by the Township
and enumerated by the ordinance standards and associated design
manual (see Chapter 22). Such plans, although in a sketch plan format,
shall not be binding on either the applicant or the Township at this
stage. However, consensus on the proposal's ability to meet the
Township's goals must be reached with staff prior to the project moving
forward. As a result, such conference should take place as early as
possible in the process to eliminate unnecessary expenditures for
design and engineering. A list of possible questions to which each
applicant should be prepared to respond is included in Appendix L.153
4. General Master Plan. The next step of the approval process involves the
preparation and submission of a general master plan. Preparation of
the plan shall be in accordance with the requirements as outlined in
153. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.

Subsection 8 and shall be commensurate with the preliminary plan as
provided for in Article V of the MPC.154
A. The general master plan shall include all adjacent land owned,
equitably owned, or otherwise controlled by the applicant within
this zoning district. If the land extends into an adjacent
municipality or district, then it is requested that the general master
plan also include such areas so as to plan for coordinated
transportation, infrastructure and open space systems. If a TTD
exists, is or could be proposed, or has been approved on an
adjacent tract, then the applicant's general master plan shall be
coordinated with the development of such adjacent land.
B. Approval Process. See Approval Process Diagram.
C. Plan Requirements. A general master plan shall be deemed to have
been submitted for review and approval when the applicant has
furnished to the Township Department of Planning and Zoning a
package consisting of all of the following documents:

a result of the required initial conference.
(3) Five black (or blue) on white prints of the general master plan
and 10 reduced 11 inches by 17 inches copies of all plan sheets
prepared in conformance with all provisions of this Part 9 and
the associated design guidelines.
(a) Such plan shall be drawn at a legible scale and shall
include a key map showing the location of the site in
relation to adjacent properties and the larger
neighborhood, adjacent zoning, and road system
connections with existing and proposed roads within 1,000
feet.
(b) All dimensions of the site shall be in feet and decimals;
bearings shall be in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Lot
line descriptions shall read in a clockwise direction. The
survey of the site shall not have an error of closure greater
than one foot in 10,000 feet.

Engineer, the Centre County Conservation District, CATA, and the
PA DEP regional office.
(1) The grant of approval of the general master plan shall be by
official written communication and shall, in the case of a plan
which proposes development over a period of years, include
sufficient terms and conditions to protect the interests of the
public and of the residents of the proposed development in the
integrity of the general master plan.
5. Development Timetable. In the event that the general master plan is
granted approval with or without conditions, the Board of Supervisors
may set forth in the official written communication the time within
which an application for final plan approval, as signified by submission
of a specific implementation plan, shall be filed or, in the case of a
general master plan that provides for development over a period of
years, the periods of time within which applications for final approval of
each part/phase thereof shall be filed. Except upon consent of the Board
of Supervisors, the time frame established for submission of all phases
of the master plan shall not exceed the vesting protection established
by Article V, Section 508(4)(v) to (vii), of the MPC.156 Any extension of
§ 27-904 FOREWORD § 27-904
FWD:1085
said time frame shall be established at the time of approval of the
general master plan.
A. Status After General Master Plan Approval. Approval of the general
master plan shall not qualify a plat of the traditional town
development or associated mixed residential area for recording,
nor authorize development, the sale of lots, or the issuance of any
building permits. A general master plan which has been given
approval shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired
by action of the Township pending the filing of an application or
applications for a specific implementation plan without the consent
of the landowner, provided that applications are filed within the
periods of time specified above or, upon the extension of such time
frame, in accordance with the official written communication
granting approval of the general master plan.
B. Revisions to the General Master Plan After Approval.
(1) The Township may accept a specific implementation plan
revised to reflect a change to the site or surroundings which
occurs after approval of the general master plan. Any changes
to the approved general master plan that are proposed prior to
the submittal of the specific implementation plan shall be
presented to the Board of Supervisors for consideration and
determination as to whether or not the changes are substantial
enough to require a modification to the approved general
master plan. If the Board determines that a modified plan is not
required, a specific implementation plan may be submitted to
signify the request for final plan approval. If the Board of
Supervisors determines that the general master plan must be
modified, the process outlined in § 27-904, Subsection 4,
above, shall be followed. Upon approval of the revised general
master plan, the applicant shall provide the Township with at
least two copies of the revised plan for their record.
(2) Any revisions to the specific implementation plan, or during
construction subsequent to approval of that plan, shall follow
the same procedures which are set forth for such
circumstances in the PRD provisions of § 27-302, Subsection
7B(1) and (2).
6. Specific Implementation Plan Approval. An application for specific
implementation plan approval may be for all of the land included in the
general master plan or, for a specific phase as set forth and approved by
the Board of Supervisors during its consideration of the general master
plan. Application shall be made to the Board of Supervisors within the
time or times specified by the phasing plan approved as part of the
general master plan, but not until after any conditions established as
part of the approval of the master plan have been satisfactorily

known as the State Highway Law, before driveway
access to a state highway is permitted. Access to the
state highway shall only be as authorized by a highway
occupancy permit, and the Township's approval of this
plan in no way implies that such permit can be acquired.
D. In addition, the following material shall be submitted:
(1) Two copies of a landscaping plan identifying the materials and

by the Board of Supervisors in the same manner as review of the
general master plan prescribed by § 27-904, Subsection 4D.
G. In the event that the specific implementation plan submitted
contains variations from the approved general master plan, the
Board of Supervisors may refuse to grant approval of the specific
implementation plan and shall, within 45 days from the filing of the
application for approval of the specific implementation plan, so
advise the landowner, in writing, of said refusal, setting forth in
said notice the reasons why one or more said variations are not in
the public interest. Provisions for requesting approval of
amendments to the approved general master plan are outlined by
§§ 27-904, Subsection 8B.
H. Conditions for Approval of the Specific Implementation Plan.
(1) The Board of Supervisor's may grant approval of a specific
implementation plan with or without conditions. If the Board of
Supervisors desires to attach conditions to a plan, it shall
include the conditions in the motion of acceptance. The
conditions imposed by the Board of Supervisors shall be
delivered in writing to the applicant, at the address given with
the final plan, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, within seven
days of the vote on the plan by the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Such notice shall include a period of time, of not more than 10
days, within which the applicant may either accept all of the
conditions imposed by the Board of Supervisors or reject any
or all of the conditions. In the event that the applicant rejects
any or all of the conditions or does not respond or notify the
Board of Supervisors of the decision to accept or reject the
conditions, then the conditions shall be deemed to be rejected
by the applicant. In the event that any or all of the conditions
are rejected by the applicant, then the approval of the plan by
the Board of Supervisors shall be automatically rescinded.
(3) The Board of Supervisors may render a decision disapproving
the plan, which decision will be the decision of the Board of
Supervisors if the applicant does not accept all of the
conditions attached to the plan by the Board of Supervisors.
(a) As a condition of approval of all plans filed, the applicant
shall permit the Township Engineer to make periodic site
inspections of such nature and extent as is necessary to
insure that the required improvements are being installed
and constructed in conformity with the design standards
contained herein or otherwise specified in approval of the
general master plan.
I. Disapproval of the Specific Implementation Plan. The Board of
Supervisors may render a decision disapproving the plan, which
§ 27-904 FOREWORD § 27-904
FWD:1091
shall also constitute the decision of the Board of Supervisors if the
applicant does not accept all of the conditions attached to the plan
by the Board of Supervisors.
7. Record Plan. Once the specific implementation plan has been given
final approval, it shall be so certified without delay by the Board of
Supervisors and shall be filed on record forthwith in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Centre County, in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 509 and 513 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code,158 together with any restrictive covenants and agreements or
other provisions which govern the use and maintenance of the TTD and
its common open space and infrastructure.
8. Corporate Bonds and Maintenance Guarantee. Approval of the specific
implementation plan may be subject to posting a performance bond
covering up to 110% of the cost of developing common open spaces,
planting plans, public improvements, and other improvements as
deemed appropriate by the Board of Supervisors. Such financial
security may include, among others, a lending institution letter of credit
or a restrictive escrow account in a lending institution. Such bond, or
other security, shall provide for, and secure to the public, the
completion of any improvements which may be required within a stated
period which shall not be longer than five years from the date the plan
received general master plan approval. The amount of financial security
to be posted for the completion of the required improvements shall be
equal to 110% of the cost of completion of the improvements to be
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion.
The basis for the determination of the costs shall take into account and
be based upon the estimated costs as would be experienced by the
Township if it were to bid and complete the project subject to the
restrictions of the Home Rule Charter, any prevailing wage
requirements or other material and labor requirements on the
Township. Each year, the Board of Supervisors may adjust the amount
of financial security required by comparing the actual costs of
improvements which have been completed and the estimated costs for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of
90 days after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to such adjustment, the
Board of Supervisors may require the applicant to post additional
security in order to assure that the financial security equals 110%. Any
additional securities shall be posted by the applicant in accordance with
the Municipalities Planning Code and this Part 9. In determining the
adjustment annually, the Board of Supervisors shall take into account
the restrictions contained above. The amount of financial security
required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of completion of
the required improvements submitted by the applicant and prepared by
a professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
158. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10509 and 10513.
§ 27-904 FERGUSON CODE § 27-904
FWD:1092
and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of
such cost.
A. Upon final approval of the plan, if requested by the applicant and in
order to facilitate financing, the Board of Supervisors shall furnish
the applicant with a signed copy of a resolution indicating final
approval of the plan contingent upon the applicant obtaining
satisfactory financial security. The final plan shall not be signed nor
recorded until the appropriate financial security is supplied to the
Township. In such case, the motion passing the final approval of the
plan shall be contingent upon receipt of satisfactory financial
security within 90 days of the date of the motion (unless a written
extension is granted by the Board of Supervisors). In the event that
satisfactory financial security is not provided within the said 90
days or within the time granted by written extension by the Board
of Supervisors, then the motion granting the contingent approval
shall expire and shall be deemed to be revoked, and the
contingency of the motion granting final approval of the plan shall
be deemed to be not satisfied.
B. Upon written application signed by the obligor and surety of a
performance guarantee in a form approved by the Board of
Supervisors, the governing body may at their discretion extend said
period, provided that satisfactory security for the completion of the
improvements within the extended time is provided or when the
improvements have been partially completed reduce proportionally
the amount of the bond or other form of security by formal
resolution.
C. In the event that any improvements which may have been required
in accordance with the finally approved plan have not been
installed, the Board of Supervisors may enforce any corporate bond
or other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If
the proceeds of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay
the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections to all the
improvements covered by the said security, the Board of
Supervisors may install part of such improvements in all or part of
the subdivision or land development or cause the same to be
installed and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to
recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All the proceeds, whether resulting from the
security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
applicant, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such security and not for any other
municipal purpose.
D. Release from the bond or other security shall be granted by the
Board of Supervisors contingent upon review and report by the
Township Engineer in accordance with procedures outlined above.

FWD:1093
§ 27-905. Occupancy Permits. [Ord. No. 1049, 11/18/2019]
E. Prior to final approval of a plan by the Township, the Board of
Supervisors may require the applicant to deliver to the Township
Secretary a maintenance guarantee in an amount of not less than
15% of the estimate of the cost of all required improvements,
guaranteeing that the applicant shall maintain all such
improvements in good condition for a period of one year after
completion of construction and installation of all such
improvements.
F. A separate maintenance guarantee shall be provided by each
applicant to ensure the health and vitality of all plant material
within the site, whether part of the open space or associated public
space, for a period of 18 months from planting. Any of the
landscaping that dies or is removed within this time frame shall be
replaced with vegetation of the same size and species. It shall also
be the responsibility of each applicant to assure the proper care
and maintenance of all plant material within the open space areas
for the duration of these 18 months and until such time as
appropriate provisions for the perpetual maintenance of the open
space areas are provided in a manner described by this Part 9 and
acceptable to the governing body.
9. Payment of Review and Professional Consultant's Fees. Prior to final
approval of a plan by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall pay
all review fees, including fees for professional consultants and
engineers for review and reports which were requested by the
Township, either in the normal course of review or as a result of a
problem or issue arising out of the normal review. The review fees and
consultant's fees to be paid shall be based upon a schedule established
by resolution by the Board of Supervisors.
10. Use Regulations. All development within a traditional town
development or associated mixed residential area shall proceed in
accordance with the standards of § 27-303, Subsections 1, 2, and 3, and
the associated design manual adopted as a part thereof. The amount
and type of uses shall be as specifically prescribed by these standards.
1. Upon completion of the erection, extension or alteration of a structure
or the establishment of the use for which a zoning permit was issued,
the applicant shall request a final inspection. The structure for which
the zoning permit was issued may not be occupied or otherwise used
until a final inspection has been completed by the Zoning Administrator.
A. Within seven days of request for final inspection, the Zoning
Administrator shall inspect the premises to determine if the action
taken complies with the regulations of this chapter. If it does, the
Zoning Administrator shall sign the building permit card or sign off
on the project within the seven-day time limitation.

B. If the action fails to comply with the regulations of this chapter, the
Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the
reason for not signing the permit card or signing off on the project
and shall state the provisions of this chapter with which the action
does not comply. The applicant may correct the defects cited in the
denial of the Zoning Administrator for final approval. If, upon
notification by the applicant and inspection of the premises, the
Zoning Administrator finds that the defects have been corrected
and that no additional defects have been created, final approval
shall be immediately permitted.
C. Failure of the Zoning Administrator to properly grant or deny
occupancy approval in the manner and time period stipulated
above shall constitute an approval of the application for occupancy,
and the premises may be occupied or otherwise used as stipulated
in the zoning permit.
D. Temporary Occupancy. Temporary occupancy may be granted in
the manner prescribed above, pending the completion of a
structure to allow for partial occupancy; issuance of said temporary
occupancy shall be at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. In
the event that a temporary occupancy permit is issued, the
applicant shall provide financial security (which may be an
irrevocable letter of credit with a federal- or commonwealthchartered
lending institution, a restrictive escrow account in such
lending institution, or a personal bond; the nature of which shall be
at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator) in an amount
sufficient to guarantee the completion of the improvements within
the prescribed time period and in an amount as set by the Zoning
Administrator. The permit shall be valid only until such time as the
action for which the zoning permit was issued is complete, or for a
period of six months after issuance, whichever is less. Upon
expiration of the temporary occupancy permission, the applicant
shall apply for permanent occupancy or, if the action remains
incomplete, may apply for one additional temporary occupancy. If
granted, temporary occupancy shall be for a period of time
determined by the Zoning Administrator but shall be for no more
than six months after issuance.
E. Prior to occupancy of a building, other than a single- or two-family
dwelling, an emergency contact card shall be completed for the
Police Department.
1. Failure to comply with any provisions of this chapter shall be a violation
of this chapter.

chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file
a complaint to the Zoning Administrator stating fully the causes
§ 27-905 FOREWORD § 27-906
FWD:1095
and basis thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall record such
complaint, immediately investigate and take action thereon as
provided by this chapter.
B. Notice of Violation. If the Zoning Administrator shall find a
violation, he shall initiate enforcement proceedings by sending an
enforcement notice as provided herein:
(1) The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of
the lot on which the violation has occurred, to any person who
has filed a written request to receive enforcement notices
regarding that parcel, and to any other person requested in
writing by the owner of record.
(2) An enforcement notice shall state the following:
(a) The name of the owner of record and any other person

(e) That the recipient of the notice has a right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days by filing a request
for appeal, in writing, with the Zoning Hearing Board
within the said thirty-day period.
C. Failure to comply with the notice within the said 30 days, unless
extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a
violation with possible sanctions, which may be as much as $500
per day of each violation plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney fees the Township incurs as a result of prosecution of such
violation.
D. Civil Enforcement. The Zoning Administrator may institute civil
enforcement proceedings as a means of enforcement if authorized
by the Manager or the Board of Supervisors.

RESIDENTIAL ACCESS STREET  A street that provides access to
abutting properties designed to carry no more traffic than that which
is generated on the street itself. No section of the street shall carry
an ADT volume greater than 200. Each 1/2 of a loop street may be
regarded as a single local access street and the total calculated traffic
volume on a loop street shall not exceed 400 ADT. These streets may

RESIDENTIAL SUBCOLLECTOR STREET  A street that provides
access to abutting properties and which may also conduct traffic from
residential access streets that intersect it. Each subcollector street
shall be designed so that no section of it will convey a traffic volume
greater than 500 ADT. Each 1/2 of a loop subcollector street may be
regarded as a single subcollector and the total traffic volume conveyed
on a loop street shall not exceed 1,000 ADT. Subcollector streets shall
be designed to exclude all external through traffic which has neither
origin nor destination on the subcollector or its tributary residential
access streets.
2.

access than arterial streets and offers lower traffic mobility. A collector
street often carries local bus traffic and provides intracommunity
continuity but ideally does not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods.

provided to major circulation movements within the urbanized area,
and from service provided to rurally oriented traffic. The urban arterial
system serves the major centers of activity of urbanized areas, the
highest traffic volume corridors, and the longest trip desires and carries
a high proportion of the total urban area travel mileage. The system
should be integrated both internally and between major rural
connections.
4.
