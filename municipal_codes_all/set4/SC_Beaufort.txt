FOREWORD 
    This code of ordinances is provided by the Municipal Association of South Carolina as a part of its 
services program for cities and towns in South Carolina. Technical staff assistance has been provided by 
PRM Law Publishers of Atlanta, Georgia, which was responsible for the organization, codification, 
indexing and printing of this code. 
    The City of Beaufort was initially incorporated on December 17, 1803. The Charter of May 2, 1913 
placed Beaufort under the general law for the government of municipalities. On October 8, 1975, the city 
adopted the Council-Manager form of government pursuant to the Home Rule Statute, Act No. 283 of 
1975. The Certificate of Incorporation was issued by the Secretary of State on June 15, 1976. 
    This codification provides a complete revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and 
permanent nature of the city. All obsolete, illegal or superseded ordinances have been repealed as a part 
of the codification. All amended ordinances are brought up to date. The code also includes certain new 
ordinances that were prepared to fill in gaps not covered by existing ordinances. 
    The code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles follow 
one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will 
often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the 
alphabetical index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section 
analysis of the articles within the chapter. 
    Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from 
the text but are covered in part 1, chapter 3, article C of the code. In most instances, references to "this 
ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "article" as deemed 
appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references, and amendment notes have been included 
throughout the code to clarify its provisions. 
    The citations included at the end of sections apply to the original source and approval date of 
ordinances. Sections of the code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been 
added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
    The new code is published in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be printed for inclusion 
on a regular basis. The Municipal Association of South Carolina has available a periodic updating service. 
Such service can be secured through an agreement between the municipality and the Association under 
which the clerk-treasurer would send new ordinances, and the Association would provide new and 
replacement pages for the code. 
    We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the city officials in the 
preparation of this code.

and Ord. No. O-54-99, adopted Sept. 28, 1999. 


Sec. 5-2021. - Definitions. 
(a) ?Appraised value. For the purposes of this article, the appraised value of any property will be the 
value attributed to that property by the Beaufort County Tax Assessor's Office. 
(b) ?Beaufort Redevelopment Incentive Program. A program established for the following public 
purposes: Increase the occupancy of empty/vacant commercial buildings, encouragement of greater 
development and density in Beaufort's downtown, encouragement of student housing and affordable 
housing, and encouragement of annexation of property into Beaufort's city limits. The program will 
reimburse property owners for city taxes that are associated with an owner's occupancy of a certain 
previously empty/vacant buildings, an owner's development of a downtown property, an owner's 
development of student housing, an owner's development of an accessory dwelling unit, and an 
owner's annexation of property into the city limits. Reimbursement of these taxes will be promised 
and paid in order to encourage property owners to accomplish the program purposes. The realization 
of these goals will promote the public health, safety, morals, general welfare and security, prosperity, 
and contentment of the citizens of Beaufort. Hereinafter, the Beaufort Redevelopment Incentive 
Program will be referred to as "the program." 
(c) ?Building. Any structure located within Beaufort city limits built for the support, shelter, or enclosure of 
persons, animals, chattels, or property of any kind which has enclosing walls for at least fifty (50) 
percent of it perimeter. For the purposes of this article, each portion of a building separated from 
other portions by a fire wall shall be considered a separate building. 
(d) ?Commercial building. Any building located within Beaufort city limits that is adapted to occupancy for 
the transaction of business; for the rendering of professional services; for the display, sale or storage 
of goods, wares or merchandise; or for the performance of work or labor and was utilized for 
commercial activity during its most recent occupancy. 
(e) ?Development of student housing. Development of housing, whether construction of new buildings 
on vacant sites or renovation of existing structures that have remained vacant continuously for at 
least one (1) full calendar year, for occupancy by students enrolled on a full or part-time basis at the 
Technical College of the Lowcountry or the University of South Carolina Beaufort. 
(f) ?Empty/vacant commercial building. Any existing commercial building that has not housed any 
commercial activity for at least one (1) year prior to any occupancy asserted by a property owner(s) 
as qualifying under the program. 
(g) ?Empty/vacant commercial building qualifications. Any commercial building which is conveyed to a 
new property owner after that building has remained empty and/or vacant continuously for at least 
twelve (12) months during which time it has been continuously and actively offered for sale or lease. 
Any substantial use of an otherwise qualified commercial building within twelve (12) months prior to a 
new owner's attempt to qualify under the program, including any commercial, charitable, or 
residential use, will compromise the previous period that the building was empty/vacant and 
disqualify that building from the program. 
(h) ?New occupancy of previously empty/vacant qualified commercial building. Any new owner(s) 
attempting to benefit from section 5-2023 of this article must actively use the qualified commercial 
building for its generally recognized or obvious purpose, including, but not limited to: operation of a 
retail business, operation of a restaurant, storing of wares/chattels, or any other business activity 
allowed in the City of Beaufort. Any owner who maintains the property in the same fashion as during 
the minimum one (1) year that the building was empty/vacant will not qualify for the program, as one 
of the public purposes of this article is to increase occupancy of previously empty/vacant commercial 
buildings. To maintain its qualification under section 5-2023 of this article, a previously empty/vacant 
commercial building that has been acquired by a new owner(s) must be continuously utilized in a 
viable, bona fide commercial capacity. A mere change in ownership of the property without 
accompanying viable commercial activity will not qualify a property hereunder. 
(i) ?New construction. For the purposes of section 5-2024 of this article, new construction will mean: 
(1) ?Construction of new buildings on previously vacant sites; 
(2) ?City-approved legal demolitions of blighted and/or dilapidated buildings and construction of new 
buildings on those sites; 
(3) ?Renovations, improvements, and/or additions to second and higher stories in existing 
commercial buildings for the purpose of creating new housing; and 
(4) ?Any renovations, improvements and/or additions or existing buildings where the renovations, 
improvements, and/or additions or existing buildings where the renovations, improvements, 
and/or additions increased the appraised value of the building by at least fifty (50) percent. 
(j) ?Property owner. For the purposes of this article, any person, persons, or entity with legal title to the 
property in question will be deemed property owner. 
(k) ?Rehabilitation of vacant or abandoned structures. For purposes of section 5-2027, rehabilitation 
means renovations that bring the structure into a habitable condition. A rehabilitated structure shall 
have sound structural framing for roof, walls, floor, and foundation systems; completely weather-
proofed wall, roof, and window systems; correctly sized heating systems; safe egress; and clean 
water supply with sanitary bathroom connected to sewer per code. A rehabilitated structure shall 
have passed a final inspection. 
(Ord. No. O-28-02, 7-9-02; Ord. No. O-13-03, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-03) 


Sec. 5-2022. - General provisions. 
(a) ?Prospective application. This article is prospective only and is not retroactive. Therefore, any action 
taken in regards to a property that would have qualified that property hereunder but which predates 
this article shall fail to qualify that property for the program. 
(b) ?Qualification for the program. Qualification for the program is contingent upon a change in the use, 
condition, and/or status of an owner's property and, to qualify under section 5-2023 of this article, a 
bona fide change in ownership of the commercial property in question. Furthermore, to qualify 
hereunder the property in question must be fully in compliance with all federal, state and local codes, 
statutes, regulations and ordinances. The property in question must qualify for the program before 
any development incentives may be earned. No person or entity other than the qualifying property's 
bona fide owner may receive any reimbursement for taxes paid. No property may qualify for the 
program more than one (1) time or under more than one (1) section. 
(c) ?City of Beaufort's approval. Any property owner seeking to participate in the program must receive 
the city's approval that the owner's property qualifies for the program before any reimbursements will 
be paid by the city to the owner. The determination as to property's qualification hereunder will be 
made by the city manager or his/her designee upon the application of the owner of the property in 
question. 
(d) ?Appeals. Any property owner aggrieved by the city manager's determination of whether that 
property owner's property qualifies hereunder may appeal to the city council by filing a letter with the 
city clerk setting forth the ground(s) for the appeal within ten (10) days of the city manager's 
determination. Council shall thereafter consider that appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
Council may consider any information presented by the aggrieved property owner and the city 
manager in making its determination as to whether the property in question qualifies for the program. 
(e) ?Source of reimbursements paid by city. For qualifying properties within the existing TIF District 
(pursuant to Ordinance No. O-34-96), any reimbursements hereunder which qualify as 
redevelopment project costs shall be paid from the TIF Fund. All other development incentives 
reimbursements paid by the city to any owners pursuant hereto shall be paid from the city general 
fund. 
(f) ?Reimbursements by city. The city will only reimburse a property owner for projected taxes or taxes 
actually paid to the city for the property qualified under the program. In no event will the city's 
development incentives to any property owner exceed the city's projections or actual payments 
made to the city by that property owner. 
(g) ?Schedule of reimbursements. Each time a property owner pays a city property tax, the city will 
reimburse that property owner the appropriate amount paid to the city provided that property 
maintains its qualification hereunder for at least ninety (90) days after the city receives the tax. 
Therefore, it is possible that a property could be approved for the program but subsequently 
disqualified for no longer maintaining that qualification pursuant hereto. 
(h) ?Disqualification. Any property that is approved hereunder may be disqualified from the program and 
any reimbursements to that property's owner may be suspended should that property fail to maintain 
its qualification hereunder. Such disqualification could be cause by any of the following or any other 
legitimate contravention of the program: ceasing commercial activities in a previously qualified 
commercial building; discovery that alleged commercial activity qualifying the property hereunder 
was merely a facade as no bona fide commercial activity takes place at or on the property in 
question; discovery that a structure intended for occupancy by students as defined in this article, is 
not longer occupied by students; violation of any federal, state, or local code, statute, regulation, or 
ordinance at, on, or by the property in question; no development or renovation is actually 
accomplished; and the taxes asserted by an owner do not actually relate to a qualifying property. 
(Ord. No. O-28-02, 7-9-02) 


Sec. 5-2023. - Occupancy of empty/vacant commercial buildings. 
    Any property owner who acquires ownership of any qualified empty/vacant commercial building and 
pays city real property taxes in regards to a qualifying property will receive credits for all such taxes paid. 
The amount of these credits will be calculated as follows: the new property owner will receive cash 
reimbursements for all city real property taxes paid over the same number of years the qualified property 
had been continuously empty and/or vacant and which was continuously available for sale and/or lease 
during that time, up to a maximum period of five (5) years. 
(Ord. No. O-28-02, 7-9-02) 


Sec. 5-2024. - New construction in downtown and redevelopment corridors. 
    The property owner responsible for qualifying new construction (as defined in section 5-2021(i) of 
this article) will be reimbursed for all city real property taxes paid by the owner on the relevant property 
attributable to the new development on that property for a maximum period of three (3) years. For the 
purposes of section 5-2021(i)(3) of this article, a property owner who creates new rental housing in an 
upper story (or in upper stories) of an existing commercial building in the tax increment financing district 
will receive double the reimbursement authorized hereunder. To qualify under this section 5-2024, the 
new construction must either be in the city downtown tax increment financing district or in a 
redevelopment corridor defined in section 11.2 of the Unified Development Ordinance of the City of 
Beaufort, South Carolina. Should a property owner elect to receive a lump sum payment for all such taxes 
which will be credited, the city will pay the property owner for all such real property taxes which the 
property owner will pay which are attributable to the qualifying new construction for a maximum period of 
three (3) years, upon that owner's receipt of a certificate of occupancy for that newly constructed building 
or that area of the previously existing commercial building which was renovated, improved, and/or added.

Sec. 5-2025. - Development of student housing. 
    A property owner responsible for development of student housing (as defined in section 5-2021(e) of 
this article) will be reimbursed for all city real property taxes paid by the owner on the relevant property for 
a maximum period of three (3) years. Reimbursements will be made on an annual basis after the city 
property taxes are paid and the owner has provided an affidavit that the units are being utilized for 
student housing. 
(Ord. No. O-28-02, 7-9-02) 


Sec. 5-2026. - Development of accessory dwelling units. 
    A property owner responsible for development of an accessory dwelling unit as defined in section 
11.2 of the Unified Development Ordinance of the City of Beaufort, South Carolina will be reimbursed for 
all city real property taxes attributable to the accessory dwelling unit for a maximum period of three (3) 
years. Reimbursements will be made on an annual basis after the city property taxes are paid and the 
owner has provided an affidavit that the accessory unit is occupied. 
(Ord. No. O-28-02, 7-9-02; Ord. No. O-13-03, § 4, 4-22-03)

    A property owner responsible for rehabilitating a structure located in the Beaufort Historic District as 
defined in section 4.9.C. of the Unified Development Ordinance of the City of Beaufort, South Carolina, 
and listed on the vacant and abandoned structures list maintained by the department of planning and 
development services, will be reimbursed for all city real property taxes attributable to the building 
rehabilitation for a maximum period of three (3) years. Reimbursements will be made on an annual basis 
after the city property taxes are paid on the rehabilitated structure. 
(Ord. No. O-13-03, § 5, 4-22-03) 


Sec. 5-2028. - Annexation incentives. 
(a) ?Annexation agreements. Any property owner who owns real property located in Beaufort County 
that is not within the corporate limits of the City of Beaufort who, upon the request of the city, 
executes an annexation agreement with the city will receive from the city a payment equal to one 
and one-half (1½) times that property's projected city real property taxes based upon the real 
property's then current appraised value, use, and city millage rate at the date of execution of the 
annexation agreement. Once such a property actually annexes into Beaufort's city limits pursuant to 
this subsection, that property's owner will receive another payment equal to one and one-half (1½) 
times that property's projected city real property taxes based upon that real property's appraised 
value, use, and city millage rate as of the time the property owner executed the annexation 
agreement. 
(b) ?Annexation of properties. Any real property owner who owns real property located in Beaufort 
County that is not within the corporate limits of the City of Beaufort who, upon the request of the city, 
annexes that real property into Beaufort's city limits, will receive credits and reimbursements for all 
city real property taxes paid by the property owner on that property and all city personal property 
taxes paid by the property owner for all personal property owned by the property owner and located 
at the annexed real property from the date of annexation for a maximum period of three (3) years. 
Should the property owner elect to receive a lump sum payment for all such taxes which will be 
credited, the city will pay the property owner for all such projected city taxes based upon that real 
property's then current appraised value, use, and city millage rate and the relevant personal property 
then located at the property from the date of annexation for a maximum period of three (3) years.

CHAPTER 4. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[7] 
Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ordinance No. O-29-04, adopted Sept. 28, 2004, deleted Ch. 4, Floodplain Regulations, 
and enacted similar provisions to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 4 derived from Ord. No. O-14-84, 
adopted Aug. 28, 1984; Ord. No. O-16-86, adopted Sept. 9, 1986; Ord. No. O-06-87, adopted April 14, 
1987; and Ord. No. O-30-93, adopted Oct. 12, 1993. 


ARTICLE A. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 


Sec. 5-4001. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws, Title 5, Chapters 7, 23, and 
25 (Articles 5 and 7) and Title 6, Chapter 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local 
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general 
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4002. - Findings of fact. 
    The flood hazard areas of the City of Beaufort are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss 
of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, 
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of 
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Furthermore, these flood losses are 
caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and 
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other 
lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4003. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and 
encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood 
conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be 
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are 
dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood 
heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the 
alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the 
accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may 
increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of 
flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
    The objectives of this ordinance are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax 
base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to 
minimize flood blight areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood 
area. The provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities 
such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the 
floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of 
this ordinance is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and 
relief efforts associated with flooding. 
    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as 
temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, 
groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational 
opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural 
state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and 
water bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains, especially floodways and 
stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions 
and human needs. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4004. - Lands to which this ordinance applies. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of 
Beaufort as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study, 
dated September 29, 1986, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, which are hereby 
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. Upon annexation, any special flood 
hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study for 
the unincorporated areas of Beaufort County, with accompanying map and other data, are adopted by 
reference and declared part of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04; Ord. No. O-20-05, 7-26-05; Ord. No. O-12-07, § 1, 4-10-07) 


Sec. 5-4005. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to 
the commencement of any development activities.

    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of 
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure 
before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred 
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. If the improvement project is 
conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the 
first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. The term does 
not, however, include either: 
(1) ?Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, 
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement 
official and which are the minim um necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include 
American with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or 
(2) ?Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's 
continued designation as a historic structure.

Sec. 5-4032. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in 
section 5-4004 or section 5-4023(10), the following provisions are required: 
(1) ?Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential 
structure (including manufactured homes), or an addition to a residential structure, the footprint 
of which is over thirty-three (33) percent of the footprint of the existing structure, shall have the 
lowest floor elevated no lower than the base flood elevation. No basements are permitted. 
Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to 
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with section 
5-4032(5) [5-4023(5)]. 
(2) ?Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, 
industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes), or an addition, the 
footprint of which is over thirty-three (33) percent of the footprint of the existing structure, shall 
have the lowest floor elevated no lower than the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid 
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the 
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with section 5-4032(5) 
[5-4023(5)]. No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be floodproofed in 
lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are 
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural 
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect 
of buoyancy. A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of 
this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in 
sections 5-4022(7) and 5-4022(9). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing 
agricultural structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in section 5-4044 of this 
ordinance. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of section 5-4044 must meet the 
nonresidential construction standards and all other applicable provisions of this ordinance. 
(Structures which are floodproofed are required to have (an approved maintenance plan) with 
an annual exercise.) The maintenance plan must be approved by the local administrator and 
notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to same. 
(3) ?Manufactured homes. No new manufactured homes or manufactured home parks shall be 
permitted in areas of special flood hazard. 
a. ?Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the 
manufactured home is elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, 
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, 
collapse, and lateral movement. 
b. ?Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. 
For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist 
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with section 19-425.39 of the South 
Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as 
amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation of 
the chassis at least thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the sight, the chassis 
shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent 
strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height an 
engineering certification is required. 
(4) ?Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or 
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security 
devices, and has no permanently attached additions. Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall 
either be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) days and be fully licensed and ready 
for highway use, or meet the requirements of section 5-4022 and section 5-4031. 
(5) ?Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that 
include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, 
or storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be 
designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood 
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a. ?Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional 
engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria; 
b. ?Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls having a total net area of not less 
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
c. ?The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
d. ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices 
provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
e. ?Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed 
area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side 
of the building. 
f. ?Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any 
foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. If flood 
velocities are excessive (greater than five (5) feet per second), foundation systems other 
than solid foundations walls should be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood 
flows are minimized. 
g. ?Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of 
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection 
with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
h. ?The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate 
rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and must be void of utilities except for 
essential lighting as required, and cannot have a permanent thermostatic controlled HVAC 
system. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault interrupt breaker 
may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in sections 5-4032(1) 
and 5-4022(2). 
i. ?All construction materials below the required lowest floor elevation specified in sections 5-
4032(1) and 5-4032(2) shall be of flood resistant materials. 
(6) ?Reserved. 
(7) ?Accessory structures. An accessory structure or garage that contains habitable space must 
comply with the elevated structure requirements of sections 5-4032(1) and 5-4032(5). 
Accessory structures, which are less than two hundred (200) square feet in size, that do not 
contain habitable space shall comply with the following criteria: 
a. ?Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including work, sleeping, 
living, cooking or restroom areas); 
b. ?Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential; 
c. ?Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the 
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; 
d. ?Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral 
movement of the structure; 
e. ?Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be installed in accordance 
with section 5-4031(4); and 
f. ?Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be provided below base flood 
elevation in conformance with section 5-4032(5). 
(8) ?Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-4004, are 
areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the 
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. 
The following provisions shall apply within such areas: 
a. ?No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, 
and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through 
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering 
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood 
levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall 
be presented to the local administrator. 
b. ?If section 5-4032(8)e. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall 
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article D. 
c. ?Reserved. 
d. ?No new manufactured homes shall be permitted. 
e. ?Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant 
nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar 
agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, 
and hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not 
employ structures or fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-
rise certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and to the extent 
that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations. 
(9) ?Fill. Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating 
buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the 
only alternative to raising the building to at least thirteen (13) feet above the base flood 
elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely 
affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the special 
flood hazard area: 
a. ?Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance with section 5-4032(8)a; 
b. ?Fill may not be placed in tidal or non-tidal wetlands without the required state and federal 
permits; 
c. ?Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill only 
upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, 
rubble fills, dumps, and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain; 
d. ?Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard D-698, and its suitability 
to support structures certified by a registered, professional engineer; 
e. ?Fill slopes shall be no greater than two (2) horizontal to one vertical. Flatter slopes may be 
required where velocities may result in erosion; and 
f. ?The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring 
properties. 
g. ?Fill may not be used for structural support in the coastal high hazard areas. 
(10) ?Swimming pool utility equipment rooms. If the building cannot be built at or above the BFE, 
because of functionality of the equipment, then a structure to house the utilities for the pool may 
be built below the BFE with the following provisions: 
a. ?Meet the requirements for accessory structures in Article IV.B.8; and 
b. ?The utilities must be anchored to prevent flotation and shall be designed to prevent water 
from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood. 
(11) ?Elevators. 
a. ?Install a float switch system or another system that provides the same level of safety 
necessary for all elevators where there is a potential for the elevator cab to descend below 
the BFE during a flood per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93 Elevator Installation for 
Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas: and 
b. ?All equipment that may have to be installed below the BFE such as counter weight roller 
guides, compensation cable and pulleys, and oil buffers for traction elevators and the jack 
assembly for a hydraulic elevator must be constructed using flood-resistant materials 
where possible per FEMA's Technical Bulletin 4-93 Elevator Installation for Buildings 
located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04; Ord. No. O-25-11, § 2, 8-9-11; Ord. No. O-27-12, §§ 2, 3, 12-11-
12; Ord. No. O-27-18, 11-27-18) 


Sec. 5-4033. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-4004, are small streams 
where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been identified. The following 
provisions apply within such areas: 
(1) ?No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new 
development shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet of the stream bank unless 
certification with supporting technical data by a registered, professional engineer is provided 
demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase occurrence of the base 
flood discharge. 
(2) ?If section 5-4033(1) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, 
all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all 
applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions of Article D and shall be elevated or floodproofed 
in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 5-4023(9). Data from 
preliminary, draft, and final flood insurance studies constitutes best available data. If an appeal 
is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the data 
does not have to be used. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal, state, 
or other source, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest 
adjacent grade. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4034. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1) ?All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and 
water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(2) ?All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood 
hazards. 
(3) ?Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development. Development of detailed floodway data will be required should the applicant wish to 
appeal the setbacks requirements of section 5-4033(1).

ARTICLE E. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 


Sec. 5-4041. - Establishment of appeal board. 
    The zoning board of appeals (ZBOA) as established by city council shall hear and decide requests 
for variances from the requirements of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4042. - Right to appeal. 
    Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision 
to the court. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4043. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair of rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination 
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a 
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and 
design of the structure. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4044. - Agricultural structures. 
    Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure in accordance with Technical 
Bulletin 7-93, Wet Floodproofing Requirements for Structures Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas in 
accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program, document number FIA-TB-7, dated 12/93, and 
available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In order to minimize flood damages during 
the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the struture must meet all of the conditions and 
considerations of section 5-4048(4), this section, and the following standards: 
(1) ?Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as listed below: 
a. ?Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for the storage of farm 
machinery and equipment; 
b. ?Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs; 
c. ?General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which are open on at least 
one side; 
d. ?For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy operations, and similar livestock 
operations, variances may not be issued for structures which were substantially damaged. 
New construction or substantial improvement of such structures must meet the elevation 
requirements of section 5-4032(2); and 
(2) ?The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an existing building which is 
substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials for the exterior and interior building 
components and elements below the base flood elevation; 
(3) ?The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral 
movement. All of the structure's components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related 
forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood 
velocities exceed five (5) feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert considerable 
pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls; 
(4) ?The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of section 5-4032(5)d.; 
(5) ?Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood 
elevation so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure which is capable 
of resisting damage during flood conditions. The structure must comply with section 5-4031(4); 
(6) ?The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of section 5-
4032(8); and 
(7) ?Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such protection may include 
protective watertight floodproofed areas within the building, the use of equipment hoists for 
readily elevating contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the 
base flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents without 
risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site out of the floodplain in 
accordance with the temporary development provisions of section 5-4032(6). 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4045. - Considerations. 
    In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all 
relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following: 
(1) ?The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2) ?The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and the safety of access to 
the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(3) ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner; 
(4) ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5) ?The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6) ?The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the 
proposed use; 
(7) ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, and the 
relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area; 
(8) ?The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(9) ?The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water 
systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(10) ?Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain areas, where no other 
alternative location for the agricultural structure exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the 
entire farm acreage, consisting of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be 
located, must be in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the 
structure are available. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4046. - Findings. 
    Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal board, in writing, and included in the 
application for a variance. Additionally, comments from the department of natural resources, land, water 
and conservation division, state coordinator's office, must be taken into account and included in the 
permit file. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4047. - Floodways. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during 
the base flood discharge would result. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4048. - Conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the appeal board 
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of 
this ordinance. The following conditions shall apply to all variances: 
(1) ?Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other 
federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination 
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that 
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public 
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the 
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4) ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be 
built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the 
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be 
maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5) ?The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any 
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(6) ?Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other development that is not in 
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Violations must be corrected in accordance 
with section 5-4024(5) of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. O-29-04, 9-28-04) 


Sec. 5-4049. - Functionally dependent uses. 
    Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent 
use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is 
protected by methods that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety.

specified. Definitions shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of any of the terms 
herein defined. 
    Bar shall mean an establishment that is devoted to the serving of alcoholic beverages for

professional corporations and other entities where legal, medical, dental, engineering, architectural, or 
other professional services are delivered; and private clubs. 
    Employee shall mean a person who is employed by an employer in consideration for direct or 
indirect monetary wages, commission, goods or services in kind or like compensation, and it shall also 
mean a person who volunteers his or her services for a nonprofit entity. 
    Employer means a person, business, partnership, association, corporation, including a municipal 
corporation, trust, or nonprofit entity that employs the services of one or more individual persons.

windows (exclusive of doorways), which extend from the floor to the ceiling, including stationary structures 
and mobile public conveyances; parking structures and other facilities having only partial exterior walls 
but otherwise enclosed by ceilings and floors shall also be included in this definition. 
    Health care facility means an office or institution providing care or treatment of persons having

employees normally frequent during the course of employment, including, but not limited to, work areas, 
employee lounges, restrooms, conference rooms, meeting rooms, classrooms, employee cafeterias, 
hallways, and vehicles. A private residence is not a "place of employment" for purposes of this article 
unless it is used as a childcare, adult day care, or health care facility. Nor is a private passenger motor 
vehicle a "place of employment" when used in the performance of employment responsibilities, provided it 
is not being used as public conveyance. 
    Private club means an organization, whether incorporated or not, which is the owner, lessee, or 
occupant of a building or portion thereof used exclusively for club purposes, or for purposes of benefiting 
particular club members and their guests, which is operated solely for a recreational, fraternal, social, 
patriotic, political, benevolent, or athletic purpose, but not for pecuniary gain, and which only sells 
alcoholic beverages incidental to its operation. The affairs and management of the organization are 
conducted by a board of directors, executive committee, or similar body chosen by the members at an 
annual meeting. The organization has established bylaws and/or a constitution to govern its activities. 
The organization has been granted an exemption from the payment of federal income tax as a club under 
23 U.S.C. Section 501. Establishments which are in fact operating as bars, restaurants, or entertainment 
venues primarily for the pecuniary benefit of the owner, or chief operating officer, or other person having

motel lobbies, laundromats, public transportation facilities, reception areas, restaurants, retail food 
production and marketing establishments, retail service establishments, retail stores, shopping malls, 
theaters, waiting rooms, sports arena, stadiums and ball parks. A private club is a "public place" when

accessories and in which the sale of other products is merely incidental. The term specifically includes 
cigar bars, which are establishments licensed for the on-premises sale of beer, wine, and alcoholic

primarily a bar or restaurant and which undertakes to make retail offerings of tobacco products as a 
means of circumventing the purposes of this article. 
    Service line means an indoor line in which one or more persons are waiting for or receiving service 
of any kind, whether or not the service involves the exchange of money. 
    Shopping mall means an enclosed public plaza, promenade, walkway, or hall area that serves to

CHAPTER 1. - SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS FOR REHABILITATED HISTORIC PROPERTIES 


Sec. 10-1001. - Special tax assessment created. 
    A special tax assessment is created for eligible rehabilitated historic properties for ten (10) years 
equal to the appraised value of the property at the time of preliminary certification. 
(Ord. No. O-23-14, 9-23-14) 


Sec. 10-1002. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to: 
(a) ?Encourage the restoration of historic properties; 
(b) ?Promote community development and redevelopment; 
(c) ?Encourage sound community planning; and 
(d) ?Promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(Ord. No. O-23-14, 9-23-14) 


Sec. 10-1003. - Eligible properties. 
(a) ?Certification. In order to be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic properties must receive 
preliminary and final certification. 
(1) ?To receive preliminary certification a property must meet the following conditions: 
a. ?The property has received historic designation. 
b. ?The proposed rehabilitation work receives approval from the historic district review board 
(HRB); or 
c. ?Be a project that commences on or after the date of the adoption of this ordinance. 
Preliminary certification must be received prior to beginning work. 
(2) ?To receive final certification, a property must have met the following conditions: 
a. ?The property has received preliminary certification. 
b. ?The minimum expenditures for rehabilitation were incurred and paid. 
c. ?The completed rehabilitation receives approval from the director of planning and 
development services as being consistent with the plans approved by HRB as part of 
preliminary certification. 
(b) ?Historic designation. As used in this section, "historic designation" means: 
(1) ?the structure is at least fifty 50 years old and is located in the historic district; 
(2) ?The structure is located outside the historic district and is listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places; or 
(3) ?The structure is listed on the "1997 Beaufort County Above Ground Historic Sites Survey," and 
has been designated as "historic" according to Section 3.21 of the Unified Development 
Ordinance and its successors. 
(Ord. No. O-23-14, 9-23-14) 


Sec. 10-1004. - Eligible rehabilitation. 
(a) ?Standards for rehabilitation work. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, historic 
rehabilitations must be appropriate for the historic building and the historic district. This is achieved 
through adherence to the standards set out in Section 3.20.C of the Unified Development Ordinance 
and is successors. 
(b) ?Work to be reviewed. The following work will be reviewed according to the standards set forth 
above: 
(1) ?Repairs to the exterior of the designated building. 
(2) ?Alterations to the exterior of the designated building. 
(3) ?New construction on the property on which the building is located. 
(4) ?Alterations to interior primary public spaces. 
(5) ?Any remaining work where the expenditures for such work are being used to satisfy the 
minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. 
(c) ?Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation means the owner rehabilitates the building, with 
expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding seventy-five (75) percent of the fair market value of the 
building. Fair market value means the appraised value as certified to the HRB by a real estate 
appraiser licensed by the State of South Carolina, the sales price as delineated in a bona fide 
contract of sale within twelve (12) months of the time it is submitted, or the most recent appraised 
value published by the Beaufort County tax assessor. 
(d) ?Expenditures for rehabilitation means the actual cost of rehabilitation relating to one or more of the 
following: 
(1) ?Improvements located on or within the historic building as designated. 
(2) ?Improvements outside of but directly attached to the historic building which are necessary to 
make the building fully useable (such as vertical circulation) but shall not include 
rentable/habitable floor space attributable to new construction. 
(3) ?Architectural and engineering services attributable to the design of the improvements. 
(4) ?Costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity of the building. 
(e) ?Scope. The special tax assessment may apply to the following: 
(1) ?Structure(s) rehabilitated. 
(2) ?Real property on which the building is located. 
(f) ?Time limits. To be eligible for the special tax assessment, rehabilitation must be completed within 
two (2) years of the preliminary certification date. If the project is not complete after two (2) years, but 
the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred, the property continues to receive 
the special assessment until the project is completed or until the end of the special assessment 
period, whichever shall first occur. 
(Ord. No. O-23-14, 9-23-14) 


Sec. 10-1005. - Process. 
(a) ?Fee required. A fee as set out in the city's fee schedule shall be required for final certification for 
each application. 
(b) ?Plan required. Owners of property seeking approval of rehabilitation work must submit an HRB 
application with supporting documentation and application fee prior to beginning work. 
(c) ?Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed application, the proposal shall be placed on 
the next available agenda of the HRB to determine if the project is consistent with the standards for 
rehabilitation in subsection 10-1004(a). After the HRB makes its determination, the owner shall be 
notified in writing. Upon receipt of this determination the owner may: 
(1) ?If the application is approved, begin rehabilitation; 
(2) ?If the application is not approved, may revise such application in accordance with comments 
provided by the HRB; 
(d) ?Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted to an application, substantive 
changes must be approved by the HRB. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the risk 
of the property owner and may disqualify the project from eligibility. Additional expenditures will not 
qualify the project for an extension on the special assessment. 
(e) ?Final certification. Upon completion of the project, the project must receive final certification in order 
to be eligible for the special assessment the director of planning and development services will 
inspect completed projects to determine if the work is consistent with the approval granted by the 
HRB pursuant to section 10-1004(a). Final certification will be granted when the completed work 
meets the standards and verification is made that expenditures have been made in accordance with 
section 10-004(c) above. Upon receiving final certification, the property will be assessed for the 
remainder of the special assessment period on the fair market value of the property at the time the 
preliminary certification was made or the final certification was made, whichever occurred earlier. 
(f) ?Additional work. For the remainder of the special assessment period after final certification, the 
property owner shall notify the HRB of any additional work, other than ordinary maintenance. The 
HRB will review the work at a regularly scheduled hearing and determine whether the overall project 
is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be inconsistent the 
property owner may withdraw his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work. 
(g) ?Decertification. When the property has received final certification and has been assessed as 
rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and must be granted the special assessment 
until the property becomes disqualified by any one of the following: 
(1) ?Written notice from the owner to the HRB and the Beaufort County auditor requesting removal 
of the preferential assessment; or 
(2) ?Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation by the HRB because of alterations or renovation by 
the owner or the owner's estate which causes the property to no longer possess the qualities 
and features which made it eligible for final certification. 
    Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given immediately to the Beaufort County 
assessor, auditor, and treasurer. 
(h) ?Notification. The city shall, upon final certification of a property, notify the Beaufort County assessor, 
auditor and treasurer that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for the special tax 
assessment. 
(i) ?Date effective. If an application for preliminary or final certification is filed by May 1 or the preliminary 
or final certification is approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective 
for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. The special assessment only 
begins in the current or future tax years as provided for in this section. In no instance may the special 
assessment be applied retroactively. 
(j) ?Application. Once the HRB has granted the special property tax assessments authorized herein, the 
owner of the property shall make application to the Beaufort County auditor for the special 
assessment provided for herein. 
(Ord. No. O-23-14, 9-23-14)

    The benefit described in section 10-2002 below shall be available to the owner of any commercial 
operation situated on land which is annexed into the city any time after March 1, 1996. A "commercial

areas of Lady's Island, for the annexed commercial (exclusively recreational use) property for the 
first three (3) years after program application for which city real and personal property taxes are paid.

personal property taxes paid for the property (that is, ninety (90) percent of such paid taxes in year 
four (4), ninety (90) percent in year five (5), ninety (90) percent in year six (6)). For each of the 
remaining four (4) years, the amount of the reimbursement shall be reduced as follows: Sixty (60) 
percent in year seven (7), fifty (50) percent in year eight (8), fifty (50) percent in year nine (9) and 
forty (40) percent in year ten (10). The city will make this reimbursement to the grantee within fifteen 
(15) business days of the city's receipt of proof of payment, satisfactory to the city, of city real and 
personal property taxes for the annexed property. Reimbursement and the calculation of the amount 
of reimbursement shall not include any late payment of taxes or any amount paid as penalties.

2.1: PURPOSE AND INTENT
For the purposes of this Code, the various districts have been
categorized as Transect-based districts (as explained in Section 2.3.1)
and conventional districts. In general, standards and provisions for
Transect-based districts are designed to create walkable, mixed-use
environments, whereas the conventional districts are more reflective of
the existing, primarily automobile-dependent, configuration.
2.2: OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
2.2.1 ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE
A. Zoning Map: The City Council hereby adopts the City of
Beaufort Zoning District Map (hereafter referred to as the
“Zoning Map”), which is on file with the Administrator.
The Zoning Map is hereby incorporated into this Code
by reference as though it were fully included here. The
Zoning Map shall be the final authority as to the status of
the current zone classification of land in the City, except
in the case of proven errors.
B. Districts Established: The City of Beaufort shall be
divided into Transect-based, conventional, and overlay
districts that implement the Comprehensive Plan. The
location and boundaries of the districts in this Article are
hereby established, and shall be shown on the Zoning
Map.
C. Interpretation of District Boundaries: The
Administrator shall be initially responsible for
interpretations of the official Zoning Map. Where
uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of the
districts shown on the Zoning Map or maps, the
Zoning Board of Appeals, upon written application
or upon its own motion, shall determine the location
of such boundaries on said Zoning Map or maps. The
following rules shall govern the interpretation of District
Boundaries:

3. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the City limit line shall be construed to
follow such City limit line.
4. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center, mean high water mark, or
shoreline of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, marsh areas, or other bodies of water, lowland, or
tidal areas, shall be construed to follow such boundaries.
5. For those distances not specifically indicated on the Zoning Map, or in other
circumstances not covered by Sections 1 through 4 above, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall interpret the district boundaries.
D. Record Keeping: The original and all revised versions of the Zoning Map shall be certified as
such by the signature of the Administrator, and shall be kept on file, in either hardcopy or digital
form, in the office of the Department of Planning and Development Services.
E. Public Access: Copies of the Zoning Map shall be made available for public inspection in the
office of the Department of Planning and Development Services during normal business hours.
2.2.2 CHANGES
A. Changes made to zone boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Zoning Map shall be
made in accordance with Section 9.16 (Amendments and Rezonings).
B. The Administrator shall enter changes onto the Zoning Map within a reasonable period of time
after a map amendment is approved by the City Council. Where the ordinance enacting a zone
boundary change contains wording explaining or clarifying the location of the new boundary,
the Administrator may enter notations on the Zoning Map reflecting the ordinance wording.
C. No changes of any nature shall be made to the Zoning Map or matter shown thereon except in
conformity with the procedures set forth in this Code. Any unauthorized change of whatever
kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this Code and punishable as
provided by law.
D. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Zoning Map that may from time to time
be made or published, the Zoning Map which shall be located in the Department of Planning
and Development Services, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land
and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City, except in the case of proven errors.
E. The Administrator shall maintain copies of superseded versions of the Zoning Map for
historical reference.
F. Where City limit boundaries change by virtue of annexation or some other means, the
following provisions shall apply:
1. Areas to be annexed into the incorporated limits of Beaufort shall be assigned zoning
classifications by the City Council.
2. In all cases where additions to the City’s total area require adjustments in the zoning
district boundaries, the adjustment shall be made to the Zoning Map.
3. When reductions are made in the City’s total incorporated area the provisions of this
Code shall no longer apply to that area.

2.3: TRANSECT-BASED AND CONVENTIONAL DISTRICTS
2.3.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE TRANSECT APPROACH
Most of the zoning districts for the City of Beaufort are ordered and classified according to the “rural-to-urban”
Transect (see diagram below). The Transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a
continuum of conditions, ranging from natural and rural lands to urban centers. The value of the Transect is that
it groups compatible buildings, public spaces, and infrastructure by scale and intensity of use, while still allowing
the development of neighborhoods where residents and workers can walk to work, school, and daily errands.
For example, a public space at the edge of the city may be a large regional park with hiking trails, while a public
space in the city center may be a more intimate square where markets and events take place. Similarly, a residence
near the edge of the city may be on a large lot set back from the street, while a residence in the downtown area
may be a condominium in a three- or four-story building.
The Transect approach is implemented in Beaufort through different levels of development intensity that range
from the T1-Natural Preserve at the low end to the T5-Downtown Core and Urban Center districts at the high
end. These Transect zones are also referred to as “form-based districts” because each has detailed provisions for
the mix of uses, building design, density, height, street design, the design of parks and open space, parking, and
other aspects that make up the city. The Transect zones that guide Beaufort’s form-based districts are as follows:

Note: All images are for illustrative purposes only.
T1–NATURAL PRESERVE DISTRICT (T1)
The T1-Natural Preserve district is intended to preserve
areas that contain sensitive habitats, active or passive
open spaces and urban parks, cemeteries, and limited
agricultural uses. This district typically does not contain
buildings, with the exception of small civic buildings,
interpretive centers, or supportive recreation facilities.
There are no specific development standards listed for this
district.
T2–RURAL DISTRICT (T2)
The T2-Rural district is made up of lands in an open,
cultivated, or sparsely settled state. Planning for future
development within the City of Beaufort does not
include rural areas, and inclusion of the T2-Rural
district here is for illustrative purposes only. There are no
development standards listed for this district.

T3–SUBURBAN DISTRICT (T3-S)
T3-Suburban district is single-family residential
in character, with less development than other
Transect-based districts within the city. While almost
exclusively residential, civic and park functions are also
complementary to the character within this district.
T3–NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT (T3-N)
The T3-Neighborhood district is residential in character,
and includes a mixture of residential and civic uses.
Residential units are an assortment of sizes and types
including cottages, small houses, two- and three-family
dwellings, village houses, and cottage courts. Carriage
houses, located behind single family homes, and on
the interior of lots, may contain studios or other small
businesses.

T4–HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT (T4-HN)
The T4-Historic Neighborhood district is a primarily
residential district that encompasses the entire historic
district with the exception of a few north-south
commercial corridors. It contains houses and residential
buildings that are characterized by generous front porches,
southern orientation, and historic architectural detailing.
A limited number of corner retail buildings historically
existed, and continue to exist, in this district.
T4–NEIGHBORHOOD (T4-N)
The T4-Neighborhood district is a mixed-use zone
of urban residential units and limited commercial
development. A wide range of building types exist in the
T4-Neighborhood district, including, but not limited
to, apartment buildings, mixed-use buildings, rowhomes,
duplexes, corner stores, and both attached and detached
single-family housing.
A sub-district of this is the T4-Neighborhood Artisan
(T4-NA) district. It incorporates more industrial uses,
as well, and is applicable in the Depot Road area where
industrial uses abut residential areas.

T5–DOWNTOWN CORE DISTRICT (T5-DC)
The T5-Downtown Core district consists of higher
density, mixed-use buildings that accommodate retail,
rowhomes, offices, and apartments. A tight network of
streets, including those in Beaufort’s historic commercial
downtown, allows this district to be a highly walkable
area. Buildings are set very close to the street in order to
define the public realm and allow for visible activity along
the streetscape.
T5–URBAN CORRIDOR DISTRICT (T5-UC)
The T5-Urban Corridor district consists of higher
density, mixed-use buildings that accommodate retail,
rowhomes, offices, and apartments located along primary
thoroughfares. A tight network of streets allows this
district to be a highly walkable area. Buildings are set
very close to the street in order to define the public realm
and allow for visible activity along the streetscape.

2.3.3 SUMMARY OF CONVENTIONAL DISTRICTS
INSTITUTIONAL & CAMPUS DISTRICT (IC)
The IC district supports generally non-residential
institutions and employment areas that are designed
in a campus-like setting, such as hospitals, universities,
research facilities, and offices. It is intended to ensure that
these unique institutions are designed to be compatible
with their surroundings and the rest of the city.
REGIONAL MIXED-USE (RMX)
The RMX district’s intensity accommodates region- and
community-serving commercial and business uses, as
well as highway-oriented businesses. Development form
supports a high-quality commercial character coordinated
with a uniform streetscape that enables pedestrian and
transit access.
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (LI)
The LI district permits office, manufacturing, industrial,
and warehousing uses, as well as their supporting uses.
Moderate to high intensities are permitted to achieve
maximum land utilization that will also accommodate
small businesses and start-up or incubator businesses. It
also allows for larger industrial parks where appropriate.
MILITARY RESERVATION DISTRICT (MR)
The MR district is applied to existing military bases and
Department of Defense lands, and provides for military
facilities and all supporting activities, such as housing,
offices, and services that are on base land, even though
they would otherwise be considered separate uses. Military
property is under jurisdiction of the federal government.
Recommendations and standards for this district are not
included since these lands are federally owned, and are
typically not subject to city regulations.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK DISTRICT (MHP)
The MHP district provides a sound and healthy
residential environment that is sufficient to meet the
needs of inhabitants living in manufactured homes, to
protect manufactured home parks from encroachment by
incompatible uses, and to encourage the consolidation of
manufactured homes into manufactured home parks.

2.5: GENERAL LOT STANDARDS
2.5.1 BUILDING PLACEMENT AND ORIENTATION
A. Frontage and Orientation on Street: All buildings shall front a street right-of-way, and have
a usable entrance on the Primary Frontage with the following conditions and exceptions:
1. Multi-Building Sites:
a. Buildings shall be located to break up the site into a series of smaller blocks defined
by streets and pedestrian walkways, and to frame and enclose parking areas, outdoor
dining areas, and/or gathering spaces for pedestrians between buildings.
EXAMPLE: USING BUILDINGS AND STREETS TO BREAK UP LARGER BLOCKS
b. Perimeter buildings and outparcels shall be configured and located to define street
edges, development entry points, and spaces for gathering between buildings.
EXAMPLE: PERIMETER BUILDINGS PROVIDING STREET FRONTAGE
c. Perimeter buildings shall be oriented so that the primary facade(s) faces a public
street and has a usable entry on that street. Buildings that are interior to a lot that has
buildings that otherwise meet the frontage requirement may have entrances that do
not face the Primary Frontage.

EXAMPLE: PERIMETER BUILDINGS DEFINING STREET EDGES
2. Live/Work Buildings: Where such buildings are permitted, the entrance to the
commercial space shall face the Primary Frontage. However, the entrance to the
residential space may be located on the side or rear.
3. Utility and Conservation Lots: Lots platted for the sole purposes of being sites for
public utilities (e.g., water, sewer, electric, stormwater) or as conservation areas shall
not be required to abut a dedicated public street. Adequate access by easement shall
be provided. Buildings associated with utilities shall meet the building standards and
guidelines of the zoning district.
4. Lots May Front on Civic or Open Space: Lots shall be permitted to front on a civic or
open space as defined in Section 7.4.3.
B. Frontage Build-Out:
1. Facades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage line or to the tangent of a curved
principal frontage line, and along a minimum percentage of the frontage width at the
setback, as specified in Sections 2.4.1.A.4 and Section 4.4 (Private Frontage Type).
a. Exceptions:
i. Exceptions may be granted by the Administrator where the parcel has an
irregular configuration, utility easements or legal constraints which prevent
compliance, or if building is sited to take advantage of specific topographical and
natural characteristics.
ii. This provision does not apply in T3-S, IC or LI zoning districts.
2. Front facades shall front public streets or rights-of-way. In the case where buildings front
multiple streets, or desire to have entrances facing the parking lot, multiple front facades
may be designed.
3. For parcels that may contain multiple structures in different phases, an overall Illustrative
Sketch, showing proposed building locations and site circulation, shall be prepared to
ensure that the frontage build-out is being met as closely as possible. These parcels will
not be required to be built out all at once, and may be phased over time. The Illustrative
Sketch is subject to future modifications as long as the intent of this standard continues
to be met — this will be evaluated by the Design Review Authority as each individual
project phases are designed.
4. Pedestrian-use areas (such as plazas, courtyards, and sidewalk cafes) within the minimum
and maximum front setbacks are exempt from the frontage build-out when all of the
following conditions are met:

a. The existing sidewalk is less than 8’ wide
b. The primary facade is within 10’ of the build-to line
c. One of the appropriate frontage types (see Section 4.4) is utilized
5. Where rear access is not possible, driveways are also exempt from this requirement,
and their width may be subtracted from the total lot width to determine the build-out
percentage.
C. Corner Lots:
1. Buildings located at street intersections shall place the primary building, or part of the
building, at the corner; however, gathering spaces may be appropriate at corners of larger
developments.
EXAMPLE: CORNER GATHERING SPACES WITHIN LARGER DEVELOPMENTS
2. Parking shall not be located between the building and the Primary Street(s).

D. Pedestrian Entries from Frontage Line:
EXAMPLE: BUILDING ENTRANCES FACING PRIMARY FRONTAGE
Buildings must have a usable entrance on the Primary Frontage. In most cases, the Primary Frontage will be a public street (left), but in some cases, the
Primary Frontage may be a civic space, alley, or pedestrian pathway (right). Additionally, the usable entry may be a door into the structure, or access onto a
porch or stoop, with the building entry to the side. The Administrator shall determine the Primary Frontage for each lot.
1. Buildings shall have their principal pedestrian entrances on a frontage line.
2. All buildings with shared entrances shall be oriented so that the primary entrance(s)
face(s) the street.
3. In the case of corner lots, the primary entrance(s) shall face the street from which the
building derives its street address.
4. In the T4 and T5 zones, blank facades are not permitted. Multiple pedestrian entrances
for public access shall be provided every 50 feet, or more frequently. The Design Review
Authority may modify the spacing of the entrances based on the amount of glazing,
interior layout, and general design of the structure.
E. Frontage Types: The private frontage of the building shall comply with the standards laid out
in Section 4.4 (Private Frontage Type).
F. Building Types: More specific standards may apply based on a specific building type (Section 4.5).
2.5.2 INFILL LOT STANDARDS
A. The minimum setbacks required may be reduced for infill lots where existing development on
the block does not match the current standards in Section 2.4.1. Setbacks for such lots shall either
match an existing adjacent setback or use the calculated average setback of the adjacent lots.
B. Special Conditions:
1. Islands of Beaufort neighborhood: Side Setback for T3-S is reduced to 10 feet.
2. Battery Shores neighborhood: Side Setback for T3-S is reduced to 10 feet.

zoning districts.
C. Where lots have frontage on more than one Primary Street and build-out on one of the streets
is planned to be phased, per Section 2.5.1.B.3, parking may be permitted within the parking
setback, provided it doesn’t prevent or preclude future build-out of the overall master plan for
the parcel. Screening is still required per Section 5.7.8.
2.6: HEIGHT
Building heights by district, as specified in Section 2.4.1, shall be determined according to the provisions below.
2.6.1 MEASUREMENT OF BUILDING HEIGHT
A. Building height is measured as the number of stories (syn. floors) in a building. A story is a
habitable level in a building of no more than 15 feet in height from finished floor to finished
ceiling.
B. Where a maximum height is also provided in feet, that height shall be taken from the average
sidewalk or site grade at the front facade of the building to the mean roof height or top of the
parapet. Where the building is located in a flood zone, the height shall be taken from the first
finished floor above the base flood elevation.
C. Under-roof areas with dormers shall be counted as half-stories.
D. Mezzanines shall be counted as stories, unless they are within a floor-to-ceiling volume that is
no more than 15 feet in height.

E. Unoccupied attics less than 7 feet in height to the ridge beam or collar tie (whichever is lower) and raised
basements less than 6 feet above the adjacent grade shall not be calculated as stories.
F. Certain buildings (such as gymnasiums, religious institutions, theatres, etc.) may require finished floorto-
ceiling heights greater than 15 feet. In such instances, the number of stories shall be calculated as the
finished floor-to-ceiling height (in feet) divided by 15. Any fractions of a story shall be rounded up to the
next whole number, with the following exception:
1. Specific to T5-UC: The maximum first floor height for such buildings shall be 24’.
G. Specific to T5-DC: The maximum height at the property line shall be 3 stories, and the maximum height
15 feet behind the property line, or front line of the building, shall be 4 stories.
2.6.2 BUILDING HEIGHT ABOVE GRADE
A. General to All Zones:
1. Freeboard: In addition to the standards listed below, where a parcel is located in a flood-hazard zone,
the minimum elevation above grade is 1 foot above base flood elevation.
2. Exception: Commercial buildings that have been floodproofed, per ASCE Section 24 or most recent
version, do not have to be elevated above grade.
B. Specific to T3 Zones:
1. If the finished floor of new single-family residential construction will be lower than the average grade
along any property line, the finished floor must be elevated a minimum of 18” above finished grade
adjacent to the building exterior.
2. The finished ground floor elevation for 2- and 3- unit buildings shall be elevated a minimum of 2 feet
above the average adjacent sidewalk, or adjacent street grade where no sidewalk is present.
3. If a single-family residence in a T3 zone is developed as part of an Alternative Development Pattern
(Section 2.8), it shall be elevated a minimum of 18” above the average adjacent sidewalk grade or
adjacent street grade where no sidewalk is present.
C. Specific to T4 Zones:
1. The finished ground floor height for residential structures shall be elevated a minimum of 2 feet above
the average adjacent sidewalk grade or adjacent street grade where no sidewalk is present. Apartment
Houses are permitted to be a minimum of 18” above grade, per Section 4.5.7.
2. The ground floor height of single-family residential structures shall be a minimum of 9 feet from
finished floor to ceiling.
3. The ground floor height of multi-family residential structures shall be a minimum of 10 feet from
finished floor to ceiling.
4. The ground floor height of commercial buildings shall be a minimum of 11 feet from finished floor to ceiling.
5. Each full story above the ground floor shall be a minimum of 8 feet from floor to ceiling.
D. Specific to T5 Zones:
1. The finished ground floor height for residential structures shall be elevated a minimum of 3 feet above

required to comply with the two-story height requirements.
Where a two-story minimum building height is required, the following configurations are
permitted in addition to a typical two-story building with habitable space on each level:
A. Two-Story Mass: This can be an open, double-height structure with a minimum building
height of 24 feet. The second floor does not need to be built out or habitable.
B. Mezzanine: The intent of mezzanines is to provide upper-level activity along street facades.
Mezzanines shall meet the following conditions:
1. All buildings shall include a minimum massing of two stories extending fully along all
street-fronting facades and any facade that is visible from a corner. If a building cannot
meet this standard through the use of a mezzanine, then the mezzanine will not be
permitted to fulfill the two-story requirement.
2. Mezzanines shall be located on the Primary Facade(s) of a building.
3. A mezzanine shall be designed as usable primary interior floor space, not storage or other
secondary, mechanical, or service functions.
4. All mezzanine floor space shall be located in direct contact with street-fronting secondfloor
windows and is required to meet all of the window transparency requirements of a
second floor.
5. When being used to satisfy a two-story building height requirement, a mezzanine level
shall meet all ceiling height standards of a second floor.
2.6.4 DIMENSIONAL HEIGHT STANDARDS
Height requirements for signs, lighting, landscape screens, and all other structures or objects for
which a dimensional height requirement is established by this Code shall be measured as the
vertical distance from the average sidewalk or site grade at the structure or object’s foundation to
its highest point.
2.6.5 ITEMS NOT INCLUDED IN HEIGHT CALCULATIONS
The height limitations of this Code shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes
not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, mechanical penthouses (provided
they are set back 20 feet from the front elevation), observation towers, transmission towers,
chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, masts and antennas (provided evidence from
appropriate authorities is submitted to the effect that such building or buildings will not interfere
with any airport zones or flight patterns). The Design Review Authority may adjust the 20-foot
setback on a case-by-case basis.

2.7: OVERLAY DISTRICT STANDARDS
Certain areas of the City may fall into one or more of the following overlay districts. When a property is
newly assigned, reassigned, or annexed into one of these districts, the owner shall be required to formally
acknowledge that they are within such district by signing a notification form, provided by the City and
recorded at the Beaufort County Register of Deeds Office.
2.7.1 BEAUFORT HISTORIC DISTRICT (HD) OVERLAY
A. Purpose: The purpose of the Beaufort Historic District is to promote the educational, cultural,
and general welfare of the public through the preservation, protection, and enhancement of the
old, historic or architecturally significant structures and areas of the City and to maintain such
structures and areas as visible reminders of the history and cultural heritage of the City, the state,
and the nation. The Historic District is a pedestrian-oriented area.
B. Applicability: Properties within the Beaufort Historic District are subject to specific standards
found in this section, and to the review procedures of the Historic District Review Board as
described in Section 10.7.
C. Beaufort Historic District Designated: For the purpose of this section, the Beaufort
Historic District is hereby established. The boundaries of this district shall be designated on
the official Zoning Map of the City of Beaufort. The boundaries of the Beaufort Historic
District and the Beaufort National Historic Landmark District are the same with the
following clarifications/exceptions:
1. Where boundaries are designated at specific roads, the centerlines of the rights-of-way of
those roads shall be deemed said boundaries.
2. The east and south boundaries of the district are established at the Beaufort River. These
boundaries are established at the parcel lines, seawalls, or at mean high water mark,
whichever extends further from the high ground.
3. Structures attached to the high ground are deemed to lie within the district and shall be
reviewed in entirety in accordance with the provisions of this section.
D. Subdistricts Established: The Beaufort Historic District shall be composed of 2 subdistricts
identified as the Beaufort Preservation Neighborhood (BPN) and the Beaufort Conservation
Neighborhood (BCN). There may be established one or more of each subdistrict within the
Beaufort Historic District, provided that all such districts shall consist of at least five acres of
contiguous land. The boundaries of these subdistricts shall be designated on the official Zoning
Map of the City of Beaufort. Where the term Beaufort Historic District (or a similar reference,
such as “historic district”) is used in this section or in any supplementary materials, it shall apply
to both subdistricts. However, where there is a specific reference to a subdistrict, that specific
reference shall apply and supersede any reference to the Beaufort Historic District.
E. Trash and Recycling Screening: All private trash and recycling receptacles shall be hidden or
screened from view. Unscreened facilities shall come into compliance with the provisions of
this section within 18 months of adoption of this Code.
F. Exemptions:
1. The Bladen Street Redevelopment District overlay zone is exempted from Historic
District Overlay standards (See Section 2.7.3.F).
2. Routine maintenance and repair of any of the existing features of a structure that does not
involve a change in design, type of materials, or outward appearance shall be exempt from
the review and approval requirements of this section.

2.7.2 RETAIL FRONTAGE OVERLAY
A. Purpose and Intent: In certain districts, it is desirable to maintain a residential character
while permitting mixed uses to occur in buildings that front designated streets.
B. Certain Commercial Permitted: Where a block face is designated on the Zoning Map as
a retail frontage overlay, the building with direct access to the designated fronting street is
permitted to be occupied by certain additional commercial uses, as indicated in the Table of
Permitted Uses in Section 3.2.
C. Designation: Retail frontage overlays are designated on the Zoning Map by a dashed line, as
indicated in the map key.
2.7.3 REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OVERLAYS
A. Purpose and Intent: The City hereby finds that it is necessary to create certain districts to
encourage redevelopment in specific areas. These districts are based upon traditional standards
for City buildings, derived from the existing conditions in the City and from a number of
sources in planning literature - See Appendix B.1.1.
B. Applicability: All parcels designated “redevelopment district” as indicated on the Zoning
Map shall be subject to these provisions.
C. Application of Standards: The majority of standards for the existing Redevelopment
Districts —
Boundary Street and Bladen Street — have been incorporated into the body
of the Code. However, where special standards apply for the district, they are listed in this
section. In the case of conflict between the standards set forth in the redevelopment districts
and any other local land development regulation, these standards shall apply.
D. Administration: Interpretation of all standards in the redevelopment districts —both
architectural and streetscape standards — shall be the responsibility of the Administrator
(syn. City Architect). See Section 9.8.2.5.b for the approval and appeal processes.
E. Parking Requirements:
1. Parcels 1/2-acre and smaller: There are no parking requirements.
2. Parcels greater than 1/2-acre: one parking space for every 1,000 square feet of leasable or
saleable building area is required.
3. Location: These parking spaces may be located either on-site, on-street (along property
frontage and/or directly across the street), in shared parking situations, or in any public
parking facility, the closest outside edge of which facility is located no more than 500 feet
from the entry to the proposed building. Documentation establishing the legal right for
the applicant to use or share parking spaces shall be provided.
4. Parking Stall Sizes: Head-in or diagonal spaces shall be a minimum of 9 feet x 18 feet.
Parallel parking spaces shall be a minimum of 7 feet x 20 feet.
5. Drive Aisle Widths: Drive aisles in parking lots shall be 22 feet wide for two-way
circulation and to provide adequate backup space for 90-degree head-in parking.
Diagonal parking and parallel parking spaces may be accessed with one-way, 10 foot wide
drive aisles. All parking lot dimensions are at the discretion of the Fire Marshal, based on
evaluation of adequate fire apparatus access and industry-approved standard.
F. Specific to the Bladen Street Redevelopment District:
1. Application of Standards:
a. Redevelopment District is Exempted from Historic Overlay Standards:

Construction of new structures and renovation or expansion of existing noncontributing
structures not listed on the most recent “Above-Ground Survey of
Historic Resources” within a designated redevelopment district shall be exempt from
the standards of the historic overlay.
b. Historic Structures: Demolition, renovation, or expansion of structures that are
listed as “contributing” on the most recent “Above-Ground Survey of Historic
Resources” shall be subject to approval by the HRB in accordance with Section 9.10.
2. Exceptions to Section 3.2 Table of Permitted Uses: Inns and Hotels are permitted byright
in this redevelopment district, and are not subject to the conditions in 3.6.2.C.3
3. Street Hierarchy: The hierarchy of streets in this district is as follows, from highest to
lowest: Bladen Street, North Street, Duke Street, Prince Street, Adventure Street. Bladen
Street is the most important street in the redevelopment district.
4. Master Plan: See Appendix B.2.3 for the original Bladen Street Master Plan.
G. Specific to the Boundary Street Redevelopment District:
1. Existing Planned Unit Developments: For existing City-approved planned unit
developments (PUD) in the district, the PUD shall apply through February 6, 2032, a
period of up to 25 years from the date of adoption of the Boundary Street Redevelopment
District. Once 25 years pass, said PUDs are no longer applicable and shall then fall under
the regulations of the Boundary Street Redevelopment District and underlying zoning.
2. Existing Buildings: With respect to existing buildings within the Redevelopment
District, their use may be maintained despite changes made to allowable uses. In the
event the building undergoes either structural or cosmetic modifications, if the cost of
improvements exceeds 50% of the Fair Market Value of the building, it will be subject to
the standards set forth by this code. This does not include repairs to a building, provided
that the configuration is not modified or altered during the repairs. The Administrator
(syn. City Architect )will have final jurisdiction over this matter. Signs not conforming
to the requirements of this section shall be altered, removed, or otherwise brought into
compliance with the requirements of this section at the time that the required building
improvements are made.
3. Specific Standards:
a. Exceptions to Section 3.2 Table of Permitted Uses: Single-family detached uses are
permitted regardless of the zoning district, except along Boundary Street and Robert
Smalls Parkway. They are subject to all development standards laid out in this Code.
b. Streets: All applications for development in the Boundary Street Redevelopment
District shall include the design of street elements adjacent to the applicant’s
property. These designs shall be according to the street type adjacent to the property,
as identified in the Street Regulating Plan (Appendix C). The street type and the
appropriate thoroughfare sections inform the applicant regarding how parking,
sidewalk, tree plantings and other elements are to be sized and arranged. Contact
with the City architect will provide clarification about the required design for
each street. All streets and alleys shall connect to other streets. Cul-de-sacs and
T-turnarounds are not permitted.
i. Street Hierarchy: The hierarchy of streets/street types in this district is as
follows, from highest to lowest: Boundary Street (US 21), Ribaut Road, Robert
Smalls Parkway (SC 170), Parallel Street, Edge Drive, Main Street, Park Street,

Neighborhood Street, House Street. This hierarchy serves as an informal phasing and
prioritization plan
ii. Construction of New Streets: See Section 7.2.1.D
c. Alleys: Alleys are required in the Boundary Street Redevelopment District to minimize curb
cuts and to provide access to parking and service areas behind buildings. Alley requirements may
be waived by the City architect for access to detached single-family residential lots greater than
45 feet in width in situations in which proper street front orientation, pedestrian circulation,
and parking can still be accomplished. Alley locations and dimensions are not fixed but shall be
designed to accommodate the alley’s purpose. Alleys may be incorporated into parking lots as
drive aisles and fire lanes. Recommended sections for alleys are included in Appendix C.
4. Master Plan: See Appendix B.3.2 for the Boundary Street Illustrative Master Plan.
2.7.4 AIR INSTALLATION COMPATIBILITY USE ZONE (AICUZ) OVERLAY DISTRICT STANDARDS
A. Purpose: The Air Installation Compatibility Use Zone (AICUZ) District shall overlay other zoning
districts. The AICUZ District includes all lands within an established footprint affected by airport
operations at the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort (MCAS Beaufort). The footprint includes all
lands underlying the noise zones of 65 DNL (day-night average sound level) and greater, and accident
potential zones shown on the 2013 AICUZ Accident Potential Zones and/or Noise Zones Map
associated with the F-35B, on file at the City of Beaufort Department of Planning and Development
Services. Properties within Noise Zone 1 are exempt from the requirements of this section. In order to
increase public awareness, and to ensure the general safety and welfare of persons affected by adverse
impacts common to military aircraft operations, Section E of this ordinance requires that property
owners within the AICUZ District be properly notified of their location. In addition, Section 2.7.4.K
sets forth limitations and restrictions that shall apply to certain land uses that have been determined to
be incompatible according to federal standards.
B. Obstruction Height Zones: There are hereby created and established certain zones that include
all of the land lying beneath the primary, clear zone, approach clearance, inner horizontal, conical,
outer horizontal, and transitional surfaces as they apply to MCAS Beaufort. An area located in more
than one of the described zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height
limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
ZONE DEFINITION MAXIMUM HEIGHT
1. Primary
Zone
An area located on the ground or water,
longitudinally centered on each runway with the
same length as the runway —
the width of the
primary zone is 1,500 feet
No object or structure will be permitted within a primary zone that is not part of the
landing and take-off facilities and is of a greater elevation above mean sea level (AMSL)
height than the nearest point of the runway centerline.
2. Clear Zone
The fan-shaped area adjacent to the landing
threshold, beginning at each end of each primary
zone and expanding to 2,284 feet wide, 3,000 feet
from the threshold at an angle of 7 degrees, 58
minutes, 11 seconds, commencing 200 feet from the
threshold
No object or structure will be permitted within the first 200 feet of a clear zone that is not
part of the landing and take-off facilities and is of a greater elevation AMSL height than
the nearest point of the runway centerline. No object or structure will be permitted within
the remaining 800 feet of a clear zone that is not part of the landing and take-off facilities
and is of a greater elevation AMSL height than those heights prescribed as the maximum
heights for the approach clearance zone and transitional zone.
3. Approach
Clearance
Zone
An area longitudinally centered about each runway
centerline extended, beginning 200 feet beyond each
end of the primary zone and extending outward for
50,000 feet —
the width of the approach clearance
zone is the same as the primary zone, uniformly
flaring to 16,000 feet at 50,000 feet distance
No object or structure will be permitted within the approach clearance zone beginning
200 feet from the runway end, that has a height greater than the runway end elevation
at its centerline, the height above the runway end increasing with horizontal distance
outward one foot vertically for every 50 feet horizontally until reaching a height 500 feet
above the established airport elevation, then remaining at this AMSL elevation until a
distance of 50,000 feet from the beginning point is reached.

ZONE DEFINITION MAXIMUM HEIGHT
4. Inner
Horizontal
Zone
An area around each military airfield constructed by
scribing an arc of 7,500 feet about the end of each
runway at its centerline and interconnecting the arcs
by tangents
No object or structure will be permitted in the inner horizontal zone that has a height
greater than 150 feet above the established airport elevation.
5. Conical Zone
An area extending outward from the periphery of the
inner horizontal zone outward and upward at a slope
of 20:1 for 7,000 feet
No object or structure will be permitted in the conical zone that has a height greater than
150 feet above the established airport elevation at its inner boundary with permitted
height increasing one foot vertically for every 20 feet of horizontal distance measured
outward from the inner boundary to a height 500 feet above the established airport
elevation at the outer boundary.
6. Outer
Horizontal
Zone
An area extending outward from the outer periphery
of the airfield’s conical zone for a distance of 30,000
feet
No object or structure will be permitted in the outer horizontal zone that has a height
greater than 500 feet above the established airport elevation.
7. Transitional
Zones
Areas extending outward from the sides of the
primary zone, the first 200 feet of the clear zone, and
the approach clearance zone, connecting them to the
inner horizontal zone, the conical zone, and the outer
horizontal zone
No object or structure will be permitted within the transitional zone that is greater in
height than the primary zone, the clear zone, and the approach clearance zone at their
adjoining boundary lines, increasing at a rate of one foot vertically for every seven feet
horizontally, measured perpendicular to the runway centerline or centerline extended,
until the transitional zone height matches the height of the inner horizontal zone, the
conical zone, or the outer horizontal zone.
1. (1) Outside of the zones established in Section 2.7.4.B, no object or structure will be
permitted within the City whose height would:
a. exceed 500 feet above ground level at its site.
b. (b) cause an existing MDA, MOCA, MVA, or a decision height to be raised. (Note:
minimum descent altitude (MDA) is the lowest AMSL altitude to which descent is
authorized on final approach or during circling-to land maneuvering in execution of
a standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) where electronic glide slope is not
provided. Minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA) is the lowest published
altitude between radio fixes on federal VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route
segments that meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route segment
and assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within 22 miles of a VOR.
Minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) is the lowest AMSL altitude at which aircraft
operating on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) will be vectored by a radar controller,
except when otherwise authorized for radar approaches, departures, or missed
approaches).
c. impose either the establishment of restrictive minimum climb gradients or
nonstandard take-off weather minimums for any runway at MCAS Beaufort
C. Accident Potential Zones (APZ): APZ’s are divided into three types along primary flight
paths
• The “clear zone” (CZ) is an area at either end of a runway that possesses a high potential
for accidents.
• APZ-1 is the area normally beyond the CZ, which possesses a significant potential for
accidents.
• APZ-2 is an area normally beyond APZ-1, which has a measurable potential for
accidents. APZs are shown on the 2013 AICUZ Accident Potential Zones and/or Noise
Zones Map associated with the F-35B, on file at the City of Beaufort Department of
Planning and Development Services.

D. Noise Zones
1. Definition: The noise exposure from aircraft operations is measured using the day-night
average sound level noise metric (DNL). The DNL averages aircraft sound levels over
a 24-hour period with an adjustment for increased sensitivity to nighttime noise. The
DNL visually is depicted as a noise contour that connects points of equal value. The
area between two noise contours is known as a “noise zone”. Noise zones are hereby
established as follows:
AIRPORT NOISE ZONE DNL VALUES NOISE REDUCTION
REQUIREMENTS
1 Less than 65 DNL 0
2a 65 to 70 DNL 25 dB
2b 70 to 75 DNL 30 dB
3 Greater than 75 DNL 35 dB
Noise zones are shown on the 2013 AICUZ Accident Potential Zones and/or Noise Zones
Map associated with the F-35B, on file at the City of Beaufort Department of Planning and
Development Services. Noise Zone 1 covers that portion of the City that lies outside of the
Air Installation Compatible Use Zone. As indicated in Section 2.7.4.A, properties within
Noise Zone 1 are exempt from the requirements of this section.
2. Residential Construction Restrictions: Aside from the residential construction
restrictions imposed by this overlay, more stringent requirements of the base zoning
district may also apply. For the purposes of this section, “gross density” means the total
number of dwelling units (which include any building or portion thereof used as a
place of residence, such as single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, commercial
apartments, live/work units, garage apartments, accessory dwelling units, etc.) on a site
divided by the entire site area.
a. Residential development is not permitted in a Clear Zone.
b. Single-family residential development within Accident Potential Zone (APZ 1 and
APZ 2) and/or within Noise Zone 3 (DNL 75 and above) may not exceed a gross
density of one (1) dwelling unit per three (3) acres.
c. Residential development within Noise Zone 2b (DNL 70 to 75) may not exceed a
gross density of one (1) dwelling unit per acre.
d. Residential development within Noise Zone 2a (DNL 65 to 70) may not exceed a
gross density of two (2) dwelling units per acre.
E. Notification
1. At all real estate closings involving a property in an APZ or noise zone as depicted on
the 2013 AICUZ Accident Potential Zones and/or Noise Zones Map associated with
the F-35B, on file at the City of Beaufort Department of Planning and Development

accommodates aircraft over 12,500 pounds and is therefore classified as “other than utility
runway.” Since aircraft can land in either direction, non-precision-instrument approaches
with visibility minimums greater than three-fourths of a statute mile have been approved and
published by the FAA for both ends of Runway 7/25 at the Airport. These classifications are
current as of October 2006. The following prescribes the airport height zones and limitations
for Beaufort County Airport as dictated by Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77. A
property located in more than one of the described zones is considered to be in only one zone
with the more restrictive height limitation.
B. Airport Overlay Zones
1. Primary Zone: This is an area longitudinally centered on a runway, extending 200 feet
beyond each end of that runway with the width so specified for each runway for the
most precise approach existing or planned for either end of the runway. The width of
the primary zone is as follows: 500 feet for non-precision instrument runways having
visibility minimum greater than three-fourths of a statute mile.
2. Horizontal Zone: This is the area around a civil airport with an outer boundary
perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of
each end of the primary zone of each airport’s runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by
line tangent to the arcs. The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have
the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest composite value determined
for either end of the runway. The radius of each arc is:
a. Runway 7 End: Ten thousand feet for non-precision instrument runways having
visibility minimum greater than three-fourths of a statute mile.
b. Runway 25 End: Ten thousand feet for non-precision-instrument runways having
visibility minimum greater than three-fourths of a statute mile.
3. Conical Zone: This is the area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal
zone for a distance of 4,000 feet.
4. Approach Zone: This is an area longitudinally centered on the extended runway
centerline and extending outward from each end of the primary surface. An approach
zone is designed for each runway end based upon the type of approach available or
planned for that runway end.
a. The inner edge of the approach zone is the same width as the primary zone (i.e., 500
feet) and it expands uniformly to a width of:
i. Runway 7 End: Three thousand five hundred feet for non-precision instrument
runways having visibility minimum greater than three-fourths of a statute mile.
ii. Runway 25 End: Three thousand five hundred feet for non-precision

instrument runways having visibility minimum greater than three-fourths of a
statute mile.
b. The outer width of an approach zone to an end of a runway will be that width
prescribed in this Subsection for the most precise approach existing or planned for
that runway end.
c. The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of:
i. Runway 7 End: Ten thousand feet for all non-precision-instrument runways
other than utility.
ii. Runway 25 End: Ten thousand feet for all non-precision-instrument runways
other than utility.
5. Transitional Zone: This is the area extending outward from the sides of the primary
zones and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal zone. Height limits
within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the
boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one foot vertically for every seven
feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway
centerline and extended centerline, until the height matches the height of the horizontal
zone or conical zone or for a horizontal distance of 2,000 feet from the side of the part of
a precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone.
C. Use Limitations: The following special requirements shall apply to uses within the Airport
Overlay that are allowed in the base zone:
1. Lights or illumination used in conjunction with streets, parking, signs or use of land
and structures shall be arranged and operated in such a manner that is not misleading or
dangerous to aircraft operating from the airport or in the vicinity thereof as determined
by the airport operator.
2. No operations of any type shall produce smoke, glare or other visual hazards within three
miles of a usable runway.
3. No operations of any type shall produce electronic interference with navigation signals or
radio communication between the airport and the aircraft.
4. No use of land shall be permitted which encourages large concentrations of birds,
waterfowl or other wildlife within the vicinity of the airport.
D. Official Map: The airport height zones defined in Section A are shown on the map entitled
“Beaufort County Airport Overlay District” which is incorporated herein by reference.
E. Notification: At all real estate closings involving a property in the approach zone or
transitional zone, the buyer, seller and witnesses shall sign the following form, which shall be
filed with the deed and/or plat at the Beaufort County Register of Deeds Office.

2.8: ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
2.8.1 SMALL-SCALE PLANNED INFILL DEVELOPMENT
A. Purpose: The alternative development options of this section allow for variety in
development standards while maintaining the overall character of a neighborhood. These
options have several public benefits:
• They allow for development that is more sensitive to the environment, especially in areas
2: Map & Districts I 2.8: Alternative Development Patterns
A d o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | Ame n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8 T h e B e a u fo r t , S C Co d e 39
with water features, natural drainage-ways, and significant trees;
• They allow for the preservation of open and natural areas;
• They promote better site layout and opportunities for private recreational areas;
• They promote opportunities for affordable housing by allowing for a mixture of lot and
building sizes, and
• They promote energy-efficient development.
B. Definition: A small-scale planned infill development is a residential subdivision in which the
lots are allowed to be smaller (in area and width), have reduced setbacks, and/or are oriented in
a different manner than otherwise required for the underlying base zoning district, but in which
the overall density cannot exceed the maximum density limit for the underlying zoning district.
C. Applicability: Subdivisions that comprise a minimum size of 1/2 acre (in T3 or T4 districts
only) or an entire block face may utilize these standards.
D. Conflict with Other Regulations: If there is a conflict between the small-scale planned infill
standards of this section and any other requirement of this Code, the standards of this section
take precedence. Otherwise, a small-scale planned infill is subject to all other applicable
requirements of this Code.
E. Approval Procedures: small-scale planned infill developments are subject to the subdivision
review procedures set forth in Section 9.9 with the following exceptions:
1. In the Historic District, these developments are also subject to review by the Historic
Review Board (Section 9.10).
2. In T3-S these developments are permitted by Special Exception and are subject to review
by the Zoning Board of Appeals (Section 10.3).
F. Lot Size: There is no set minimum lot size (area or width) requirement within a smallscale
planned infill development. Individual lot sizes shall be adequate to meet all required
density and development standards. Minimum lot sizes may be established by the Planning
Commission during the subdivision process.
G. Setbacks and Building Separation: The minimum setback and frontage standards of the
base zoning district apply along the perimeter of a small-scale planned infill development. All
detached structures within a small-scale planned infill development shall be separated by a
minimum distance of 10 feet. This distance may be reduced subject to the building code.
H. Open Space Requirement: A portion of the gross area of the development shall be reserved
for some type of usable, common open space. See Section 7.4.2 and 3 for required amounts
and appropriate types of open space. See Section 7.4.5 for ownership and maintenance
requirements.
2.8.2 COTTAGE COURTS (A.K.A. BUNGALOW COURTS, POCKET NEIGHBORHOODS, COURTYARD HOMES)
A. Purpose: The alternative development options of this section allow for development of
smaller dwelling units, organized around a common outdoor space, that are appropriate to the
character of the surrounding neighborhood. They provide a space-efficient and economical
alternative to traditional single dwelling unit development. The ownership model may be
either fee-simple or condominium-style, and can achieve the same benefits as those listed in
Section 2.8.1.A.
B. Definition: A Cottage Court development is a residential development in which small
buildings are oriented around a central green or open space that is accessible by all residents

C. Density: Additional density is permitted, as follows, in exchange for the buildings having a
limited footprint, size, and height:
1. In T3-S the overall density is permitted to be up to 1.25 times the maximum density limit.
2. In T3-N the overall density is permitted to be up to 2 times the maximum density limit.
D. Applicability: Cottage Courts are permitted in T3 and T4 districts only. They are not
permitted in the Historic District.
E. Lot Size: Prior to development, lots or combinations of lots shall meet the following
dimensional standards:
1. 160 feet wide by 100 feet deep where formalized parking on-street exists on adjacent
streets and no on-site parking is required
2. 180 feet wide by 100 feet deep if on-site parking is required
3. Exception: In T3-S, Cottage Courts are limited to lots greater than 1 acre
EXAMPLES: COTTAGE COURT FACING A PUBLIC GREEN SPACE WITH ON-SITE PARKING REQUIRED
Example: Shown in T3-N district; 8 units shown on a 210’ wide x 140’ deep double frontage lot
with common on-site parking area accessed via alley and easement, and a community structure
Example: Shown in T3-N or T4-N district; 6 units on a 200’ wide x 100’
deep lot (minimum lot size), individual on-site parking with shared
access easements. Note that in T3-S, a Cottage Court would not be
permitted on this lot since it is less than 1 acre.
EXAMPLES: COTTAGE COURT FACING A PUBLIC GREEN SPACE WITH ON-STREET PARKING
Example: Shown in T3-N district; 4 units on a 160’ wide x 100’ deep lot (minimum lot
size); no on-site parking required
Example: Shown in T3-N or T4-N district; 6 units on a 160’ wide x 100’ deep lot
(minimum lot size); no on-site parking required
Note: All diagrams show the Cottage Courts in context with one or two typical lots on either side of the Cottage Court units.
F. Conflict with Other Regulations: If there is a conflict between the cottage courts standards
of this section and any other requirement of this Code, the standards of this section control.
Otherwise, cottage courts are subject to all other applicable requirements of this Code.
G. Approval Procedure: Cottage courts are subject to the subdivision review procedures set
forth in Section 9.9.
H. Number of Buildings: Cottage courts shall contain a minimum of 4 residential buildings.
For courts that have 8 or more buildings, a community structure shall be provided. Examples
of these include garden sheds, pavilions, community houses, etc.
I. Building Size & Details:

1. Buildings may have a maximum 800 square foot footprint (not including porches), and
may be no more than 1.5 stories tall.
2. Front porches shall be provided facing the common space, and they shall be a minimum
of 8 feet deep.
3. Where a building is located on both a public street and a public space, it shall address the
street with either a porch or stoop, and shall provide entries onto both spaces.
4. The public spaces of the home shall be located facing the common space. These include living,
dining, and kitchen areas. First-floor bedrooms should not be located fronting the civic space. An
exception to this shall be made on corner lots, where public spaces may face the street.
J. Setbacks and Building Separation: The minimum setback and frontage standards of the base
zoning district apply along the perimeter of a cottage court development. Buildings may be
attached or detached. All detached structures within a cottage court development shall be separated
by a minimum distance of 10 feet. This distance may be reduced, subject to the building code.
K. Parking Requirements & Configuration: One space per unit is required. Adjacent on-street
parking spaces may count towards this requirement. Parking shall be screened from the public
right-of-way by buildings. A common parking area, accessed via an alley, is recommended. If
this is not possible, access easement(s) shall be provided as part of the final plat. Parking shall be
screened from neighboring properties per the requirements of Section 5.7.8.A.
L. Open Space Requirement: A minimum of 400 square feet of common open space is required
per unit. The open space shall be connected to the public right-of-way either by opening
up to the street, or via a paved path no less than 8 feet wide. Ownership and maintenance
requirements shall be in accordance with Section 7.4.5.
EXAMPLE: COTTAGE COURT FACING A PUBLIC GREEN SPACE
Units located around a public space with parking in the rear and access to the green space along a public right-of-way.
2.8.3 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT FLOATING OVERLAY DISTRICT
A. Purpose and Intent: The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) overlay District is
established to
• support the development of fully integrated, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods with a variety of housing choices.
• prevent the development of large, single-use, homogenous subdivisions.
• minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure costs and environmental
degradation.
• create a streamlined way to transition the City’s zoning to the Transect-zones.

B. Process and Applicability: The application of the TND overlay district shall depend upon
the size of the site in accordance with the provisions below. The TND overlay district shall not
be applied to any site with a T1 (Natural Preserve District) base district designation.
1. General Process:
a. Master Plan: Applicants shall first develop and present a master plan, complying
with the Sketch Plan requirements in 9.3.1.B, for the entire parcel which shall include
land allocations by Transect zone, proposed subdivisions of property, required open
space, street regulating plan, neighborhood structure(s) and other information
required to indicate compliance with this section. Upon approval by the MPC - and
subsequent rezoning approval as applicable - the master plan is vested.
b. Preliminary Plat: Upon approval of the Master Plan, the applicant shall proceed
towards approval of a Preliminary Plat (Section 9.9.3).
2. Applicability:

for the construction of community structures, (schools, community buildings, religious
institutions, etc.) and their support facilities (parking areas, etc.). These sites shall be
counted towards the open space requirement. Such sites shall be easily accessible within
the neighborhood — and to the greater community where appropriate — and shall help
to visually anchor important vistas. See Section 4.5.13 for building design standards for
civic buildings. If after 5 years, the community facilities are not constructed, the land may
be converted to common open space.
F. Neighborhood Structure
1. TNDs shall be organized by individual pedestrian sheds (or walking areas) with a ¼-mile
radius (1,320 linear feet).
EXAMPLE: PEDESTRIAN SHED IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT
A typical city block averages 300’ long. About four city blocks comprise a “pedestrian shed” - 1/4 mile radius, or 5 minute walk.
1/4 MILE RADIUS ( 5 MINUTE WALK)
2. Neighborhood centers/main streets shall be located at or near the center of all pedestrian
sheds, and shall include
a. the area of the TND with the greatest intensity of development,
b. one or more civic buildings and/or uses, and
c. one or more Community Green Spaces.
3. Each pedestrian shed is encouraged to include a variety of uses, building types, and
housing types, so that the majority of lots within the TND are within walking distance
(no more than 1/2 mile) of a neighborhood center, and at least 2 types of housing are
provided (e.g., single-family detached, rowhomes, duplexes, apartments) per pedestrian
shed.
4. Street networks shall be interconnected using a grid or modified grid. Exceptions and
special designs can be considered due to geography and special site conditions.
5. Block Size: Blocks shall be compact so that they are comfortably walkable and
appropriate for their context.
a. In T3-S zones, block sizes are flexible, but the perimeter shall not exceed 2,640 linear
feet (1/2 mile). An average block perimeter less than 2,000 feet is preferred.
b. In T3-N zones, block sizes are flexible, but the perimeter shall not exceed 1,700 linear
feet (1/2 mile). An average block perimeter less than 1,500 feet is preferred.
c. In T4, and T5 zones, blocks shall be no more than 400 feet on any side. An average

block length of 250-300 feet is preferred. The block perimeter shall not exceed 1,320
linear feet (¼-mile).
d. Exceptions may be made for natural elements such as wetlands, trees, topography, to
be incorporated into the site design.
6. Within 200 feet of all parcels outside the TND, lot widths, depths, and building types
shall provide a graduated transition to adjacent development, particularly any such areas
that are of a lower intensity/density.
G. Relief: Modifications to these standards may be reviewed and permitted by the MPC if the
plan is found to still be in compliance with the intent of this Code.
2.8.4 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PUD)
A. Purpose and Intent: The PUD is intended to encourage innovative land planning and site
design concepts that cannot be achieved by other mechanisms provided by this Code. PUDs
should achieve a high level of environmental sensitivity, aesthetics, high quality development
and other community goals by:
1. allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, open space and design
amenities.
2. promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing
development to take advantage of special and unique site characteristics, locations,
building types and land uses.
B. Process and Applicability:
1. General Process: PUDs are considered a two step process. First, there is a Rezoning
which follow the general procedures of Section 9.16. Second, a Final Plat approval, per
Section 9.9.4 shall occur. A complete master plan and written report shall be developed
and submitted for approval as part of the rezoning process in order to determine the
desired standards and design of the project. Those documents shall be submitted in
accordance with the following standards:
a. Master Plan: Applicants shall first develop and present a master plan, complying
with the Sketch Plan requirements in 9.3.1.B, for the entire parcel which includes,
but is not limited to:
i. Size: Size, in acres, shall be listed on the master plan. For redevelopment sites, as
defined in Section 8.3.2.A, PUDs shall have a minimum of 4 acres. For all other
developments PUDs shall have a minimum of 10 acres. If the project is intended
to be developed in phases, the master plan shall include all phases.
ii. Districts: Land allocations by zoning district, including specific modifications
to the Code requirements of those districts clearly highlighted.
iii. Street Layout and Regulating Plan: the design and location of the streets shall
be provided. Streets shall conform with the street sections in Appendix C of this
code. Additional bicycle and pedestrian circulation shall also be indicated.
iv. Lot Layout: Proposed subdivisions of property, required open space, street
regulating plan, neighborhood structure(s). The PUD shall have provisions to
allow for a systematic methodology to provide a variety of lot sizes.
v. Open Space: Open space requirements are 1.5 times the standards set in Section
7.4.2 with the exception that a minimum of 10% open space is required for all
2: Map & Districts I 2.8: Alternative Development Patterns
46 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
PUDs, regardless of size or zoning district. These should be clearly indicated on
the master plan.
vi. Community Space: the requirements of 2.8.3.C.3 shall be met.
vii. Stormwater Requirements: Stormwater shall be considered on a PUD-wide
basis and the general locations shall be indicated. Floodplain information shall
also be included on the master plan.
viii. Resources: The general location of all historic, cultural, and environmentally
sensitive resources shall be depicted on the master plan.
b. Written Report: A written report shall be submitted to explain the type, nature,
intent and characteristics of the proposed development, and shall specifically include:
i. Site Description: A general description of the proposal, including a detailed
description of the site, location, context, and any cultural, environmental and/or
historic resources.
ii. Vision Statement: The goals, tenets, any special initiatives which the
development intends to achieve shall be clearly identified for review and
discussion.
iii. Incompatibilities :A detailed description of the provisions of the Code which
prevent the development, as desired shall be provided. This shall include analysis
showing how the general Land Development standards in Article 7, and the
TND Floating Overlay District standards in Section 2.8.3 limit the intended
development.
iv. Modification to Code: A detailed description of exceptions or variations from
the requirements of this Code, per the incompatibilities listed above. All items
not explicitly listed as modifications will be subject to the requirements of this
Code.
v. Land Allocation: Tables showing the total number of acres in the proposed
development and the percentage designated for each proposed type of land use,
including open spaces, recreation areas, public facilities, wetlands and wetland
impacts. This should be coordinated with the Districts as shown in the master

3.2.1 OVERVIEW OF USE CATEGORIES
A. Definition of Use Category: See Section 13.1 (Definitions of Specialized Terms)
B. Basis for Classification: Use categories classify land uses and activities into categories based on common
functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type
of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories
provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate Districts.
C. Principal Uses: Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the
principal use. The “Characteristics” subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each
principal use.
1. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses: When all principal uses of a development fall within
one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. When the principal uses of a
development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category
and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category.
D. Accessory Uses: Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use, unless otherwise
stated in this Code. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the
principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. See Section 3.12
for additional standards for accessory uses and structures.
E. Use of Examples: The “Examples” subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the
respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not
on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself a “wholesale warehouse,” but sells mostly to
consumers, is included in the “Retail Sales and Service” category rather than the “Wholesale Sales” category. This is
because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the “Retail Sales and Service” category.
F. Similar Use Interpretation Criteria: The following considerations shall be used in making similar use
interpretations:
1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use
category
2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity
3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity
4. The customer type for each activity
5. The relative number of employees in each activity
6. Hours of operation
7. Building and site arrangement
8. Vehicles used with the activity
9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use
10. How the use advertises itself
3.3: RESIDENTIAL USES
3.3.1 OVERVIEW OF RESIDENTIAL USE CATEGORIES
A. Household Living
1. Characteristics: Household Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a
household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis.
3: Land Use Provisions I 3.3: Residential Uses
A d o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | Ame n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8 T h e B e a u fo r t , S C Co d e 53
2. Accessory Uses: Accessory uses include recreational activities, hobbies, accessory
dwelling units, enclosed storage, and parking of the occupants’ vehicles. Home
Occupations are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations set forth in
Section 3.3.2.D.
3. Examples: Examples include single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, triplexes,
condominiums, townhouses, and other multi-family dwellings, upper floor residential,
retirement center apartments, some congregate care facilities, and manufactured housing
and other structures with self-contained dwelling units.
4. Exceptions: Living in a dwelling unit where units are rented for less than 30 days is
classified in the Overnight Guest Accommodations category.
B. Group Living
1. Characteristics: Group Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a
structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of “household living”. The
size of the group may be larger than the average size of a household. Tenancy is arranged
on a monthly or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period
are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see
“Overnight Accommodations” — Section 3.6.1.C — and “Community Service” —
Section 3.5.1.A — categories). Generally, group living structures have a common eating
area for residents. The residents may receive care, training, or treatment.
2. Accessory Uses: Accessory uses include recreational facilities, dining facilities, and
parking of vehicles for occupants and staff.
3. Examples: Examples include group dwellings, dormitories, fraternities and sororities,
nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and monasteries and convents.
4. Exceptions:
a. Lodging where tenancy may be arranged for periods of less than 30 days is classified
in the Overnight Guest Accommodations category.
b. Lodging where the residents meet the definition of a household, and where tenancy
is arranged on a month to month basis, or for a longer period, is classified as
Household Living.
c. Congregate Care Facilities, where individual units meet the definition of a dwelling
unit in Article 13, are classified as Household Living.
d. Monasteries and convents affiliated with, and attached to — or on the same campus
as — a church are considered Religious Institutions.
3.3.2 ADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL USES
The following additional standards apply to the approval and development of projects where the
use is listed in the “Table of Permitted Uses” in Section 3.2 as Conditional (C), Special Exception
(SE), or T4-Neighborhood Artisan (A). In addition, any Building Design standards, as set forth in

4.3: CONTEXTUAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
4.3.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
All buildings possess a number of common elements that combine to express a structure both as an entity
and as a part of the larger community. No building is so insulated from its surroundings as to avoid an impact
on the surrounding context. Applications that require Major Design Review (Section 9.8) and Certificate
of Appropriateness, Major (Section 9.10.2), are subject to the additional contextual design guidelines
of this section. These guidelines shall be used by the Design Review Body as applicable, to evaluate the
appropriateness of the proposed construction to its immediate context and the character of the broader
community.
4.3.2 SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
A. Conformity to Civic Master Plan: The Civic Master Plan provides site-specific guidance for the
development of many parcels within the city. The intent of this Code is to facilitate the vision and ensure
the visions are permitted. In instances where the Civic Master Plan provides guidance for building and
site design standards on a particular parcel, development applications on that parcel should meet the
general intent of such guidance to the extent practicable, as determined by the Design Review Body.
B. Rhythm of Development on the Street: Monolithic massing that disrupts the predominant building
pattern of the neighborhood and corridor is strongly discouraged.
EXAMPLE: RHYTHM OF DEVELOPMENT SHOWING APPROPRIATE (LEFT) AND INAPPROPRIATE (RIGHT) PATTERNS
C. Massing and Articulation
1. New construction should complement the massing of neighboring buildings by utilizing roof forms,
architectural trim, differentiation of facade planes, and a relationship of solids (siding and walls) to
voids (window and door openings) that are consistent with the patterns established in neighboring
buildings.
2. When large scale construction is proposed that is not consistent with the predominant building
height and lot width of the surrounding area, special attention shall be paid to specific building
design elements in order to articulate a building form that is appropriate to the neighborhood
context. These include the items listed in the paragraph above, along with siting, setbacks, and
facade treatments.

finishes or as applied treatments at the pump island or on the canopy.
c. Either a pump island curb or bollard is recommended for the protection of
dispensing units.
4.5.13 CIVIC BUILDINGS
Civic buildings contain uses of special public importance and may be located in any zoning
district. They require special design standards as described below, but should also be compatible
with the surrounding context. Civic buildings may include, but are not limited to, municipal
buildings, churches, libraries, schools, hospitals, and public recreation facilities. Museums may
sometimes be considered civic buildings. Civic buildings do not include day care facilities, retail
buildings, residential buildings, and privately-owned office buildings.
A. Placement: In order to provide greater flexibility to create a special architectural statement,
civic buildings are not subject to minimum or maximum setback requirements. Instead,
building placement should be designed with consideration of the following guidelines.
1. Placement of civic buildings, depending upon program and site, can often benefit from
being set back from the adjacent build-to lines of private development. This allows the
scale of the building to have more visual emphasis and can create a public space in the
foreground. The amount of this setback should be carefully determined, based on the
urban design objectives of the particular site.
2. Buildings should be oriented toward the public realm (streets, squares and plazas) in a
very deliberate way.
3. Civic buildings and their primary architectural elements should be placed at the
termination of public vistas to provide an appropriate level of visual importance.

EXAMPLE: CIVIC BUILDING TERMINATING VISTA
4. Entrances should always be located on the most prominent façade(s). Avoid entrances
that are at the rear or are visually concealed.
5. Parking shall be located at the rear and/or side of the building. In general, parking
location standards shall match the zoning district.
B. Massing
1. The primary massing of civic buildings should be symmetrical in form. The appearance of
a balanced design increases the level of formality, which is appropriate to the public use.
EXAMPLE: CIVIC BUILDING SYMMETRY
2. Massing of civic buildings, although often larger as a whole, should be divided into
visually distinct sections. Massing divisions should provide visual order to the building
and create vertical proportions within individual elements.

C. Scale/Height
1. The scale of civic buildings should be larger and more monumental than corresponding
buildings in order to be more prominent and visible across greater distances.
2. Floor-to-floor heights and architectural details should be proportionately larger than
those of private buildings that exist or are anticipated within adjacent blocks.
EXAMPLE: CIVIC SCALE AND FLOOR-TO-FLOOR HEIGHTS
3. Prominent roof forms and additive elements, such as cupolas, should be used to visually
extend the height of the building.
EXAMPLE: ROOF FORMS AND ELEMENTS THAT DISTINGUISH CIVIC BUILDINGS
D. Materials/Details
1. Civic buildings should evoke a civic character and be carefully designed to reflect the
architectural character of Beaufort.
2. Civic buildings should be made of durable, high-quality materials that create a sense of
permanence and lend civic identity to the city. Preferred materials include brick, stone,
and cast concrete. Stucco should only be utilized when applied over structural CMU.
3. Building details should be designed at 2 scales. At the larger scale, details should be
robust, so as to be read from a distance. Nearer to the building, the details of the lower
levels should include another measure of refinement that can only be seen up-close at a
pedestrian scale.
4. Building design elements should be used which allow civic buildings to act as focal points
of the community. Depending on the architectural style of the building, the following
4: Building Design & Infill Standards I 4.6: Building Design Standards
102 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
elements should be considered in the building design:
a. Pronounced window lintels/sills/mullions,etc.
b. Columns with a capital and base
c. A water table constructed of high-quality masonry units (such as cast-in-place stone)
that extends beyond the face of the facade
d. Vertically oriented windows of at least a 2:1 ratio
e. Cornice lines with significant depth and multiple levels of relief
f. A monumental raised entryway
g. A formal landscaped area or plaza
h. A tower element with a turret, cupola, or similar treatment
4.6: BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS
4.6.1 GENERAL TO ALL APPLICABLE DISTRICTS (SEE 4.2.2)
A. Size, Mass and Scale: The scale of buildings and accessory structures (including canopies)
shall be appropriate to the scale of structures located in the neighboring context.
B. Proportions of Bays and Openings: All building bays, including porches, colonnades and
porticos as appropriate, shall be square or vertical in proportion, unless the design merits
a horizontally-proportioned opening. Wall openings, with the exception of transoms and
storefronts, shall be square or vertical in proportion. The facade of a proposed building
should draw upon the proportion and number of bays in surrounding buildings, as defined by
windows, doors, and column spacing, to establish a compatible scale.
C. Building Materials: Building wall materials shall be combined on each facade only
horizontally, unless the building is broken vertically by a change of plane, or a vertical
architectural element. Heavier materials, such as masonry and stucco, shall be located below
lighter materials, such as cement fiber or wood siding.
D. Roof Forms: Where pitched roofs exist, primary roofs shall have a minimum slope of 4:12,
while ancillary roof slopes may be no less than 2:12.
E. Garages and Accessory Structures: Attached garages, detached garages, and other accessory
structures shall be subordinate in height, footprint, and proportion to the primary structure
on the site, and shall be compatible with the principal structure in terms of roof form,
materials, and color. Where a garage contains an accessory dwelling unit above, it may exceed
the height of the primary structure.
F. Trash, Mechanical, Utility and Service Equipment and Areas
1. Loading docks, service areas, and trash disposal facilities (e.g., trash and recycling
receptacles, compactors, dumpsters) shall be hidden or screened from view of streets,
parks, squares, waterways, or significant pedestrian spaces. Loading areas may be oriented
toward adjoining developed properties that are zoned for nonresidential uses ,if such
loading areas are screened from view. See Section 2.7.1.E for specific provisions about
these areas in the Historic District.
2. Mechanical equipment, such as ventilation systems, commercial exhaust fans, rooftop
terminations, commercial cooling equipment, heating and air conditioning units, TV
antennas, and satellite dishes, shall be hidden or screened from view. Lattice, open brick
enclosures, or vegetation can be used to conceal mechanical equipment. Screening

4.7: HISTORIC DISTRICT INFILL DESIGN GUIDELINES
4.7.1 APPLICABILITY AND INTENT
The following principles shall be considered by the HRB for new construction within the Historic District overlay.
The intent of these principles is to protect the integrity and coherence of the Historic District, and to provide clarity
and consistency for developers, designers, and regulators.
4.7.2 PRINCIPLES FOR COMPATIBLE INFILL
A. The District is the Resource, Not Only Its Individual Parts: Beaufort is comprised of a number of individually
significant buildings. Additionally, Beaufort’s historic areas are significant as a collective whole, and shall be
considered as such and protected in their entirety. This is the primary, overarching principle.
1. New construction shall respond to and protect the integrity of the overall Historic District in much the
same way as an addition does to a historic building.
2. The integrity of the district — why, where and when a property is important — shall be upheld in all new
construction and rehabilitation projects. Guidelines for determining integrity are as follows:
a. Location: This is the relationship between the property and its historical context.
b. Design: This is the combination of elements that create the feeling of a district or structure. These
elements include building patterns, streetscapes, site elements, building size, mass and scale, spatial
relationships, and specific architectural elements and details.
c. Setting: This is the physical environment of a property, and should be evaluated on its context as well as
on the historical role the property has played and continues to play. Important features include topography,
vegetation, man-made features, and relationships between existing structures and their surroundings.
d. Materials: These are the physical elements that make up a property or district.
e. Workmanship: This is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or time period. This
particularly applies to rehabilitation projects, but for new infill projects, workmanship of surrounding
structures should be considered and respected. Retaining the details of the original craft and craftsman
(i.e., wood, masonry, tabby etc.) of the original building ensures the historic fabric is retained and serves
as an important component of the integrity and the patina of age of individual structures and the
district as a whole.
f. Feeling: This is the property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time.
This particularly applies to rehabilitation projects, but for new infill projects, the feeling of surrounding
structures should be considered and respected.
4: Building Design & Infill Standards I 4.7: Historic District Infill Design Guidelines
112 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
g. Association: This is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a property. This
particularly applies to rehabilitation projects, but for new infill projects, association of particular sites
and neighborhoods should be considered.
B. New Construction Shall Reinforce the Historic Significance of the District: Infill buildings should relate
to and strengthen the core characteristics of the district, as identified in the National Register nomination’s
“Statement of Significance”.
1. New construction should build upon the history and established pattern of the district through its design,
landscape, use, and cultural expression. An understanding of the character and significance of the district
should predicate any design or development activities.
2. If applicable, cultural expressions and/or historic uses within the district may be considered in design or
development activities.
C. New Construction Shall Complement and Support the District: The Historic District has a distinct rhythm
of massing, scale, and siting. Infill buildings should not deviate in a detracting manner from these elements, but
appear as complementary members of the district.
1. Lot size, massing, siting, floor area ratio, and height must correspond to the adjacent buildings that
contribute to or complement the rhythm of the district.
2. The use of buildings will be secondary to their design and integration into the district. However, newly
introduced uses should not be detrimental to the historic fabric.
D. Infill Shall Be Compatible Yet Distinct: New buildings should be identifiable as being of their period of
construction; however, they should not be so differentiated that they detract from – or visually compete with –
their historic neighbors. Within historic districts, compatibility is more important than differentiation.
1. Because the district is the resource, the reconstruction of buildings that existed within the district during
the period of significance is allowed. Reconstructions shall be done in accordance with the Secretary of the
Interior’s “Standards for Reconstruction”.
2. Style is discouraged from being the primary indicator of differentiation.
3. Means of differentiation may include materials, mechanical systems, and construction methods.
E. The Exterior Envelope and Patterning of New Buildings Shall Reflect District Characteristics: Infill design
elements, patterning, texture, and materials should reflect the aesthetic and historic themes of the district.
1. Patterns of fenestration, building divisions, setbacks, and landscapes that are characteristic of the district
should inform the design of new buildings.
2. Mechanical and automobile infrastructure should be appropriately concealed when not consistent with the
district’s character.
F. Contributing Buildings Should Not Be Demolished to Create Infill Opportunities: Properties deemed
contributing in the “1997 Beaufort County Above Ground Historic Sites Survey”, or in the most recent historic
resources survey, should not be removed or rendered non-contributing to make way for new construction.
G. Archeological Resources Shall Be Preserved in Place or Mitigated: When new construction disturbs or affects
archaeological resources, mitigation measures should be taken such that the history of a the site can be traced.
See Section 8.3 for archeological assessment requirements.
1. Archaeological mitigation must conform to local, state, and federal laws and accepted professional
standards.
2. When appropriate, archaeological mitigation should be accessible to the general public in an educational capacity.
3. Information yielded from archaeological mitigation should be interpreted in the new building and
throughout the district.

5.1: PURPOSE AND INTENT
5.1.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to
A. recognize the importance of trees and other landscaping
and their contribution to health, welfare, beauty, safety,
history and general well-being in all areas within the
jurisdiction of the city.
B. establish reasonable minimum standards governing the
preservation, planting, protection and maintenance of
trees and other landscaping.
C. protect and enhance property values.
D. maintain the aesthetic quality of the community as a
whole.
E. moderate climate and reduce energy costs,
F. mitigate the negative impact of noise, glare, air and water
pollution, and soil erosion on the city and its residents.
5.1.2 INTENT
The intent of this article is to create user-friendly standards that
encourage the preservation of existing vegetation, and guide
appropriate mitigation, if necessary. Trees are an extremely
important resource in Beaufort and give the city some of its
unique and defining characteristics. Great care should be taken
to integrate new development into the existing landscape, and
to preserve natural vegetation where possible.

determines that the report would not change the outcome of the plan. A certified arborist report shall always
be required for all Landmark Trees that will be impacted by or removed due to development. The Certified
Arborist Report shall be incorporated into the project submission as part of the Site Plan (see 9.3.1.C).
C. Mitigation for Preserving Existing Trees: To incentivise saving a variety of species and sizes of existing trees,
credits shall awarded for their preservation at a ratio of 1:1. All trees, except for Laurel Oaks, Sweet Gums,
Pecans and non-Longleaf Pines, may be used as mitigation credits for that same species. Example: If a 12”
magnolia tree is removed, but three 3” magnolias are saved, only 3” of magnolia trees would be included in the
mitigation calculation per the schedule in 5.6.2.D.

These credits may be used to satisfy the requirements in the Section 5.3.1, Section 5.5 - provided
the preserved tree(s) is located in accordance with the requirements of that section - and Section
5.6.2.D. Landscape credits may not be used to reduce the total number of street trees required,
or to alter the street tree spacing requirements established in Section 7.2.5 (Street Tree Planting
Requirements), unless these trees are located adjacent to the street in the location where street trees
would typically be planted. However, required street trees do count towards the mitigation credits.
5.3.3 TREE ROOT PROTECTION ZONE (TPZ) REQUIREMENTS
A. Applicability: A permanent “tree protection zone” (TPZ) surrounding preserved trees shall be
established to protect the underground root system. This area shall not be disturbed at any time
before, during, or after construction.
B. Size and Shape: The minimum TPZ shall be as follows:
1. A circle with a radius of 1/2 foot per 1 inch of DBH, ideally measured from the leading edge
of the root flare.
EXAMPLE: TREE PROTECTION ZONE SIZE DIAGRAM
2. The TPZ shall be indicated on both site and landscape plans for all trees shown to remain.
C. Adjustments and Exceptions:
1. The size and shape of the TPZ may be adjusted where any of the following occur: root
pruning, root invigoration, restoring the natural grade of the soil, W.A.N.E. feeder, porous
paving materials, and/or a tree well.
2. The size and shape of the TPZ may be adjusted as needed to accommodate construction
practices. The reduction of minimum radius of TPZ may require additional remediation
measures as recommended and performed by a certified arborist prior to site disturbance.
D. Tree Wells: In general, tree wells are discouraged, but if they are used, a well shall encompass
at least half the area beneath the canopy of the tree and extend in every direction, no less than
halfway from the trunk to the tree’s dripline. Tree root aeration system shall be installed that shall
extend from 2 feet inside the tree well wall to the dripline of the canopy.

E. Pre-Construction Treatment: Based on the certified arborist report, the following may be
required to retain trees and facilitate their health during and after the construction process: root
pruning, fertilization, and root invigoration. These practices, as applicable, shall be performed a
minimum of 3 months prior to site disturbance.
F. Prohibited Activities: The following are prohibited within all TPZs:
1. Placement of building materials, dirt, debris, oils, paints, or any other materials, equipment, or
vehicles
2. Irrigation pipe installation
3. Grading, with the exception of a 2-inch cut or 2-inch fill of topsoil, sod, or mulch
4. Paving for roadways, driveways, or sidewalks
5. Cutting of roots for installation of utilities or drain pipe of any kind
6. Exception: If excavation work for water line installation within a TPZ is deemed necessary
during construction operations, such excavation shall be accomplished utilizing hand
excavation methods that remove soil around tree roots without severing them.
G. Construction: Prior to commencing construction or any site alterations, fencing must be installed to
prevent encroachment by people and vehicles. Fencing shall meet the following standards:
1. Height and Location: Fence shall be a conspicuous, visually prominent, 3-foot high barrier
erected around the TPZ and approved by the administrator.
2. Trees on Adjacent Property: Where the TPZ of adjacent trees encroaches into the
development site, additional fencing shall be required around the TPZ of trees on adjacent
properties or right-of-way.
3. Material: All fencing required shall be made of durable materials sufficient to survive the
period of construction.
4. Groups of Trees: Barriers may be erected around groupings of trees, where feasible. Signage
designating such areas shall be put in place, reading “TREE PROTECTION ZONE: KEEP OUT.”
5. Timing: The barrier shall remain in place until all construction, with the exception of
landscaping installation, is substantially complete.
6. Encroaching with Machinery: Administrator approval is required for machinery to pass
within a TPZ during construction, in which case special cushioning measures, consisting of
plywood sheeting covered by a 6-inch layer of wood mulch, or an equivalent material, will be
required.
H. Damages and Reparations: When encroachment or construction activity within a TPZ has
damaged or destroyed a tree or tree growing site, the city, at the discretion of the Administrator,
may seek mitigation for the value of any damaged trees within a TPZ, per the Mitigation Schedule
in Section 5.6.3, and/or may require treatments or additional plantings. Such mitigation shall
occur prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
5.3.4 STREET TREE PLANTING REQUIREMENTS

5.4: TREE REMOVAL
5.4.1 PERMIT REQUIRED
A. Applicability: A zoning permit is required for the following tree modifications, as per Section 9.4:
1. Permit Required for Removal:
a. A Permit shall be required for the removal or relocation, of any tree 8” caliper or larger at
DBH, or any tree designated as a specimen or landmark tree, as established in Section 5.3.2.
b. For single family and 2- and 3- family buildings on existing lots of record wherein a
permit is only required for the removal of Specimen or Landmark Trees.
2. Permit Required for Pruning: A permit shall be required for the pruning of any overstory tree
designated as a landmark tree, as established in Section 5.3.2. Pruning must be done by, or under the
direct supervision of, a certified arborist, and shall meet ANSI A300 Standards for tree pruning.
3. Trees Designated for Retention: A permit shall be required for the removal, relocation, or
pruning of any tree previously designated to be retained on an approved development plan.
B. Criteria for Reviewing Applications for Tree Removal: The following criteria shall be considered
by the administrator in determining whether or not to issue a zoning permit:
1. Health: Whether or not the tree is in good health, according to a certified arborist report or
staff evaluation
2. Development Potential: Whether or not the tree constrains reasonable development of
the specific site, considering lot size, applicable setbacks, context, building type and use,
stormwater requirements and other relevant site development considerations
3. Access: Whether or not the tree is a hazard to pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular traffic
4. Structural Interference: Whether or not the tree presents a hazard to buildings, structures, or
utility lines
5. Cost: Whether or not there are cost-effective alternatives to tree removal
C. Tree Removal in Conjunction with Development: If trees are to be removed in conjunction with
the physical development of a site, submission of a tree retention/removal schedule is required to
accompany the Site Plan (Section 9.3.1.C). See Appendix A for an example of this schedule. All
trees, both to be saved and removed, shall also be noted on the landscaping plan. This schedule and
plan must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Design Review Body prior to the issuance
of a Project Permit. No tree removal may commence without a Project Permit.
1. Buffer Areas: Preserved trees in the buffer areas shall be counted toward the minimum tree
conservation requirements of the buffers stated in Section 5.5.1. Recognizing that the perimeter
buffers lie outside of the buildable area, the intent of this provision is to preserve as many of these
trees as possible while allowing for access, reasonable visibility, and other uses permitted in the
buffer area that practicably are best located within the buffer.
2. In exceptional cases where the Administrator determines that the species of a tree or grouping
of trees is on an official state or federal list of threatened or endangered species, then approval
is specifically required for removal.
5.4.2 EXCEPTIONS
A. Infrastructure: Utility companies, governmental agencies, and city agencies in the course of
constructing or maintaining easements or rights-of-way for water, sewage, electricity, gas, drainage,
telephone, or television, if the applicable company or agency, within 12 months after the date of

adoption of this Code, has executed an agreement with the city that
1. Recognizes the need to minimize trimming of hardwood overstory trees that do not
significantly interfere with the intended purpose of construction or maintenance.
2. Establishes, to the extent practicable, design guidelines for construction and maintenance that identify
the saving of hardwood overstory trees as a factor to be considered in the design process.
3. Establishes guidelines to avoid limbing, topping, or severe pruning of trees whenever
reasonably practicable, and where it is unavoidable, according to ANSI A300 Standards,
which may include tree removal.
4. Provides for a consultation process with the city prior to the commencement of major
construction or maintenance or the removal of any specimen or landmark tree.
B. Waiver for Emergency: In the event that a tree poses a threat to public safety due to death, disease,
or damage resulting from events including, but not limited to fires, floods, hurricanes, other
natural disasters, intentional harm, or negligence, the administrator may waive the requirements of
Section 5.4.1. As soon as it is feasible after the waiver, the administrator shall issue written findings
outlining the threat to public safety that prompted the waiver. The administrator may require that
the owner of the site replace the tree when the findings conclude that the removal was necessitated
by intentional harm or negligence.
C. Normal Tree Maintenance: Nothing in this Code shall restrict normal tree maintenance by a
property owner (including removal of dead wood and branches or limbs that endanger life or
property) for any tree except landmark trees upon which any pruning must be done according to
Section 5.4.1.A.2.
5.5: PERIMETER LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
Perimeter buffers are intended to provide spatial separation between uses of differing intensities. Buffers that are required
for protection of environmentally-sensitive areas are prescribed by Section 8.1 (Resource Protection Standards).
5.5.1 BUFFER REQUIREMENTS
Landscaped perimeter buffers shall be preserved or established along the front of the sites located within

information on best practices for pruning. See Section 5.4.1.A.2 for pruning permit requirements.
D. Permitted Improvements within Perimeter Buffers: Perimeter buffers shall contain only
vegetation, with the following exceptions:
1. Non-Habitable Structures: Non-habitable structures may not encroach into buffers.
2. Pedestrian Coverings: If awnings, colonnades, arcades, or galleries are incorporated into the
building design, landscaping may be reduced or eliminated.
3. Vehicular Access Driveways: These may encroach into buffers only if the driveway is placed
approximately perpendicular to the buffer, or if the driveway is shared by adjoining parcels.
4. Sidewalks, Bicycle Paths and Bicycle Parking: These may encroach, provided that they shall
not count toward meeting the required landscaped area.
5. Stormwater Management: Stormwater and drainage facilities that permit vegetation may
encroach into the buffers if the planting requirements are fulfilled.

1. Edges: All building perimeter landscape areas shall be protected from overhanging vehicles by
curbs or wheel stops.
2. Sidewalks and Handicap Ramps: Depending on the building design and orientation,
sidewalks and handicap ramps may be placed within the designated building perimeter
landscape area. In these instances, the administrator may require that some or all of the
required foundation planting are mitigated elsewhere on the site.
3. Pedestrian Coverings: If awnings, colonnades, arcades or galleries are incorporated into the
building design, landscaping may be reduced or eliminated.
5.6: LANDSCAPE INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE
5.6.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Trees planted shall be botanically compatible with local conditions, healthy, and disease-and pestfree.
Plant materials shall conform to the standards established by the American Association of
Nurserymen in the “American Standard for Nursery Stock” (ASNS).
B. Irrigation shall be required in all new development unless the Administrator specifically waives this

requirement, based on the unique character of the development and/or the nature of the proposed
plant material.
1. Exception: New construction in T3 zones, and single-family residential construction in T4
zones on new or existing lots, is not required to have irrigation.
C. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition and shall be kept free from refuse and debris.
D. Installed trees must adhere to the grades and standards outlined in the ASNS. The minimum size at
installation of all trees and shrubs planted pursuant to the requirements of this Code is as follows:
1. Overstory trees: 2.5 caliper inches (measured at 6 inches above grade)
2. Understory trees: 8 feet high
3. Shrubs: Shrubs must be reasonably projected to grow to maturity (i.e., to meet specific size or
coverage requirements) within 3 years, unless otherwise specified herein.
E. Existing healthy shrubs and trees may be used to satisfy any requirements of this Code, provided
they meet the minimum size requirements outlined in Section 5.6.1.D.
F. Use of existing vegetation, native plants, drought-tolerant plants, and water conserving irrigation
techniques, such as use of a rain sensor, and re-use of rain water, is encouraged. Preservation of
groupings of trees (e.g., tree save areas) is encouraged and generally favored over preservation of
scattered individual trees.
G. Where understory trees are specified, preserved, or planted, broad-leaved overstory trees may be
substituted on a one-to-one basis to satisfy the requirement.
H. In conjunction with any development, grass or ground cover shall be planted, or mulch installed to a
depth of 3 inches, on all portions of exposed bare ground not otherwise developed or landscaped. This
shall include planting strips and other areas within rights-of-way that are contiguous to the development
site. Grass and/or ground covers shall provide 75% coverage within 1 calendar year from the time of
planting. Gravel or crushed shell may be approved as an acceptable ground cover if it is coordinated with
the overall site and landscape design; however they shall not be used as a substitute for organic mulch in
plant beds. The use of dyed hardwood or synthetic material is prohibited.
I. All earthen drainage structures with a maximum gradient of 3:1 may be hydroseeded or sodded.
Ditch and pond banks with slopes greater than 3:1 shall be treated with erosion control fabric or
matting and/or receive erosion resistant landscaping materials such as ground covers or wetland
plant species.
J. Landscaping shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any road or driveway.
K. Where site conditions are inappropriate for an overstory tree, due to existing utilities, building
design, or other conflicts either above or below ground, up to 2 understory trees may be
substituted for 1 overstory tree.
L. Severe trimming, pruning, or other maintenance that results in significant alteration of the natural
shape of a tree or modification of the central leader (including “lollipopping,” “heading,” or similar
techniques) is prohibited, except in conjunction with public utility maintenance.
5.6.2 REPLACEMENT PLANTING AND MITIGATION
A. Applicability:
1. Where the administrator approves removal of specimen and landmark trees for new
development
2. Where any vegetation, existing or proposed, used to comply with the requirements of this
section, does not survive in a healthy condition

3. When a specimen and/or landmark tree is removed from a property without permission from the
administrator, is significantly damaged during construction, or significantly declines and is recommended
for removal by a certified arborist at the end of the two year maintenance guarantee period
B. Additional Mitigation Options: Where the city arborist determines that a site cannot sustainably support
all, or a portion of, the required replacement, due to the size and shape and/or structures and/or viable site
constraints, the following options are available to the applicant to fulfill the mitigation requirements:
1. Fee in Lieu of Planting On-Site: a fee based on the mitigation schedule in 5.6.2.D shall be paid to the City
for the purposes of tree planting and tree maintenance.
2. Planting on an Alternative Site: trees may be planted on city-owned property, including parks or the City’s
tree farm, or on other property owned by the applicant; all property shall be in city limits. The alternative
sites shall be approved by the City Arborist and shall be in accordance with previously approved plans,
streetscapes, etc.
C. Exceptions:
1. Mitigation for approved tree removal is not required in the T3, T4-HN, or LI districts, or for single-family
and 2-3 family dwellings in any other districts if the required tree coverage requirements set out in 5.3.1 are
still met. Trees removed without appropriate approvals are subject to mitigation in all districts.
2. A Specimen and/or Landmark tree that fails due to a natural catastrophe does not require mitigation.
D. Replacement and Mitigation Schedule: Replacement plantings & fee in-lieu-of shall be according to the
following chart:

B. Credits for On-Street Parking
1. On-street parking spaces along the lot frontage may count toward the minimum number
of required parking spaces if needed.
2. For multi-family dwellings over 3 units, and for commercial buildings over 4,000 square
feet, adjacent existing on-street parking within 400 feet from the property line may be
used to count toward the on-site parking requirement if needed.
3. Where on-street parking does not exist, additional on-street parking spaces meeting City
standards (see Appendix C) may be constructed to fulfill all or part of the on-site parking
requirement. This must be approved by the Technical Review Committee and any outside
agencies, as appropriate.
4. On a block face where formalized on-street parking is available, single-family and 2-family
dwellings, and nonresidential uses with less than 4,000 square feet of space, and any
structure listed as “Contributing” on the “1997 Beaufort County Above Ground Historic
Resources Survey,” or most recent historic survey, shall be exempt from these off-street
parking requirements.
C. Maximum Number of Parking Spaces: The maximum number of off-street parking spaces
shall be as follows:
1. For buildings with a footprint less than or equal to 60,000 gross square feet, no more than
140% of the required minimum number of parking spaces are permitted.
2. For buildings with a footprint greater than 60,000 gross square feet, no more than 125%
of the required minimum number of parking spaces are permitted.
3. Exceptions:
a. Parcels in the LI district are exempt from these requirements.
b. Parcels in the Boundary Street Redevelopment District are exempt from these
requirements. See Section 2.7.3.E for requirements in this overlay district.

1. Required parking may be provided in off-street parking facilities on another property
within 400 feet of the site proposed for development, as measured along street rightsof-
way. Parking further than 400 feet may be approved by the Administrator if it is in
conjunction with a plan to provide access to the lot (e.g., shuttle service).
2. In any transect-based district, required parking may not be located along a major
thoroughfare without being screened from the street by buildings.
3. Pedestrian access between the use or the site and the off-premise parking area shall be via a
sidewalk or walkway.
4. The owner shall provide a written parking agreement reflecting the arrangement with the
other site.
5.7.5 PARKING EXCEPTIONS
A. In the T5-DC District, all nonresidential uses, except for motels/hotels/extended stay guest

5.7.6 SHARED PARKING AND PARKING REDUCTIONS
A. Shared Parking - 2 Uses: When 2 use types share common parking facilities, the minimum
amount of required parking may be reduced. The minimum amount of required parking shall
be calculated as the sum of the required parking for the 2 uses separately, divided by the factor
listed in the table below.
SHARED PARKING FACTOR FOR TWO USES
Residential Lodging Office Retail / Restaurant
Residential 1.0 1.1 1.4 1.2
Lodging 1.1 1.0 1.7 1.3
Office 1.4 1.7 1.0 1.2
Retail / Restaurant 1.2 1.3 1.2 1.0
EXAMPLE: A mixed-use building that typically requires 10 residential spots and 20 retail
spots may be reduced as follows: (10+20) / 1.2 = 25 spots. This is a 5-spot reduction due to
the shared parking factor.
B. Shared Parking - 3 or More Uses: When 3 or more use types share common parking facilities,
or if a use type is not listed in Table 5.7.4.A, the amount of required parking may be reduced
as appropriate in accordance with Section 5.7.6.C below.
C. Parking Reductions
1. The Administrator may grant a reduction in the parking requirements set forth in this
section in the following cases:
a. Where uses in the same or adjoining development, having different peak hour
demand, seek to share parking, the applicant must submit to the administrator an
analysis and substantiated projections of peak parking demand — based on historic
data from other locations or a similar use — for the entire development to justify the
shared use of parking spaces for separate uses.
b. Where the special nature of a certain development (e.g., special types of housing
projects inhabited by persons with low or no automobile ownership) does not
require the amount of parking listed in Section 5.7.4.
c. Where fewer parking spaces are needed due to location and use — e.g., if there is a
high concentration of residential units adjacent to a neighborhood-serving use, a
parking reduction may be warranted.
2. The Administrator shall consider the following in determining whether a reduction is
warranted:
a. The likelihood that the reduced number of parking spaces can satisfy demand
b. The amount of time during the year when the number of spaces provided may be
insufficient and the amount of resulting parking overflow
c. The impact of periodic overflows upon the public streets and other parking facilities
d. The nature of surrounding land uses, character of surrounding road system, and
nearby circulation pattern

and off-street loading areas, shall include painted lines, wheel stops, or other methods of
identifying individual parking spaces and loading areas and distinguishing such spaces
from aisle and other circulation features.
5. Parking Space Marking: The individual parking spaces in a lot shall be delineated in all
parking lots except those utilizing road bond, gravel, grass, or other vegetative surfacing.
Such parking lots shall delineate parking spaces with a wheel stop or vegetative buffer.
6. Front Yard Parking: Where Section 7.2.3 (Lot Access Standards)permits driveways, they
may be used for front yard parking areas, but the width of such front yard parking areas
shall be limited to the driveway width specified in that section.
7. Shopping Cart Storage: Up to 4 spaces for shopping cart storage may be provided.
Any additional spaces shall count towards the maximum number of parking spaces, if
applicable.
B. Pedestrian Corridors in Parking Lots: Parking lots with 40 spaces or greater shall be
designed to separate pedestrian travel from vehicles. They shall include designated pedestrian
walkways to provide safe access to building entries for pedestrians.
1. Perimeter sidewalks — typically located on public rights-of-way— and/or interior
parking lot pedestrian corridors may be utilized to provide the required pedestrian access.
2. Pedestrian pathways (if provided) shall be a minimum 5 feet in width.
3. Where parking is located between a public entrance and the fronting sidewalk, a pedestrian
pathway shall be provided, following the shortest practical route across the parking lot
between at least 1 such entrance on each side of the building facing a public street.
4. Pedestrian pathways shall be clearly delineated. This may be accomplished with the use of
paving materials that differ from that of vehicular areas, striping or other similar methods.

6.1: PURPOSE
6.1.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this section is to regulate the time, place and
manner in which signs shall be permitted. In furtherance of
these purposes, standards are provided that are designed to
protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare,
and to enhance the physical appearance, natural beauty, and
historical significance of the city.
It is the desire of the city to allow business owners the
opportunity to post adequate signage that contributes to the
public realm, while preventing distractions and obstructions
to motor vehicle operators and pedestrians that might lead to
accidents or traffic congestion, removing obstructions to light,
air and open space, and reducing the accumulation of clutter.

6.2.2 MASTER SIGN PLANS
A. Applicability: Master Sign Plans are required for the following development types:
1. New multi-tenant or multi-building development with 5 or more occupiable spaces.
2. Existing multi-tenant or multi-building development when the primary tenant proposes
signage changes —
the owner/manager of the multi-tenant/multi-building center shall be
responsible for preparing the Master Sign Plan. For existing multi-tenant/multi-building
centers where there is no clear primary tenant (for example, when there are several tenant
spaces of equal size,) a Master Sign Plan shall not be required, but is highly encouraged.
B. Approval Required: No permit shall be issued for an individual sign requiring a permit unless
and until a Master Sign Plan for the lot has been reviewed and approved by the appropriate body.
C. Conformance with Plan: After approval of a Master Sign Plan, no sign shall be erected,
placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan.
D. Amending a Master Sign Plan: A Master Sign Plan may be amended by filing a new plan that
conforms with all requirements of the Code then in effect.
E. Voluntary Restrictions: The Master Sign Plan may contain such other restrictions as the
owners of the parcels may reasonably determine.
F. Design: The design, material, color, location, and illumination of signage shall be compatible
with the overall design of the development.
G. Size: The size of all signs must be equal to or less than the amount indicated in Sections 6.5
and 6.6 with the exception of monument signs; however in no monument sign shall exceed
125SF regardless of the additional increase permitted in this Section. Sizes for monument
signs are as follows:
1. Where 5-10 occupiable spaces are located on one parcel, a 125% increase in monument
sign area is permitted.
2. Where 11-20 occupiable spaces are located on one parcel, a 150% increase in monument
sign area is permitted.
3. Where 21 or more occupiable spaces are located on one parcel, a 200% increase in
monument sign area is permitted.
4. Contiguous Parcels: When the owners of 2 or more contiguous parcels (disregarding
intervening streets and alleys) file for a Master Sign Plan, 1 freestanding sign shared
between all parcels shall be permitted an increased area based on the number of
occupiable spaces listed above.
H. Sign Types: All sign types listed in Sections 6.5 and 6.6 may be included in a Master
Sign Plan. In addition, other types of signage may be permitted at the discretion of the
administrator, provided that it is compatible with the overall design of the development and
does not result in signage in excess of the overall allowances listed in this Article.
6.3: GENERAL PROVISIONS
6.3.1 PLACEMENT AND DESIGN
A. Placement: Except as permitted specifically in this article, signs shall not be posted in the
public right-of-way, on trees, or utility poles, except where encroachments are specifically
permitted by this article.

considered to include all lettering, wording, and accompanying designs and symbols. Sign area
shall also include any background material, panel, trim, color, and direct or self-illumination used
that differentiates the sign from the building, structure, backdrop surface, or object upon which
or against which it is placed. The sign structure shall not be included as a portion of the sign face,
provided that no message, symbol, or any of the aforementioned sign face criteria are displayed
on, or designed as part of, the sign structure.

6.4.4 SIGN MATERIALS
A. Inappropriate materials and finishes generally include: interior-grade wood, unfaced plywood,
plastic and plastic substrates, and unfinished wood.
B. Sign materials shall complement but not necessarily match the building’s materials — for

but not appropriate for a clapboard frame structure.
C. Sign brackets shall be constructed of painted wood or prefinished, prepainted metal.
Guywires, if needed, shall be as inconspicuous as possible.
D. Signs shall be mounted in a way that minimizes damage to historic materials. On masonry

the provisions in Section 6.5. If a freestanding sign is present on a street frontage, only one
additional fixed sign per business shall be permitted on that street frontage. A third sign will
be allowed if it is a window sign and in keeping with Section 6.5.
B. If it is more compatible with the architecture, a tenant space may be permitted multiple wall
signs, at the discretion of the administrator, provided that the total square footage does not
exceed the maximum square footage permitted.
C. A building with more than 1 storefront shall have similar sign and mounting treatments so as
to provide balance and unity to the building.

7.1.5 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES
A. Types Allowed: Prior to approval of a Final Subdivision Plat (Section 9.9.4), the applicant
shall provide a performance guarantee to ensure the completion of required improvements
within a period of time as agreed upon by the Administrator and the applicant, and expressed
in the guarantee. Such guarantee may be in the form of a performance bond, a surety bond, a
cash deposit, or a letter of credit. A performance guarantee shall be posted in the amount of
125% of the total cost of improvements.
1. Performance / Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit: The performance or surety bond,
or letter of credit, shall be in a form acceptable to the city. It shall include a pledge by the
bank, insurance company or other bonding/lending institution that the funds necessary
to carry out the terms of the agreement are guaranteed for payment, and will be released
only upon receipt of written instruction from the city.
2. Cash Deposits: If surety is in the form of a cash deposit with the City of Beaufort,
proportional parts thereof shall be refundable in relation to progress payments less
retainage, subject to approval of the city and subject to a minimum deposit balance of
25% of the project cost.
3. Maintenance Guarantees: If the applicant completes all required improvements and
complies with all conditions of the subdivision agreement as determined by the city, the
remainder of monies retained by a financial institution or by the city may be released to
the applicant or his successor in title. Prior to release, the applicant shall provide the city,
prior to the issuance of any building permit, a performance bond, a surety bond, or a cash
deposit equal to the amount determined by the city that would ensure the repair of any
damage to the existing improvements during the course of any construction, but in no
case will the amount of the security be less than $1,000 for each individual building lot.
Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy, the city shall determine whether or
not any breakage or damage has occurred. If no damage to any off-site improvements has
occurred, then the city may release the security to the applicant or his successor in title. If
damages have occurred, they shall be repaired, or the city may draw on the security before
it is released.

7.2 STREET NETWORK AND DESIGN STANDARDS
7.2.1 STREET INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS
A. Purpose and Intent: The Street Infrastructure Plans (in Appendix C) provide diagrams of the
city’s street network and establishes the ideal alignment, heirarchy and design characteristics
– including total right-of-way width, sidewalk and streetscape amenities, parking lanes, travel
lanes and other geometric and urban design details – for all existing streets, proposed streets
that have been adopted as part of an Official Map, and new potential streets in the City of
Beaufort.
B. Official Street Network Plan: Pursuant to the authority of South Carolina Code Section 6-7-
1210, et seq (1976), as amended, the City has previously adopted several Official Maps. An
Official Street Network Plan is incorporated into this code in order to represent a composite
of these previously-adopted Official Maps.
1. Purpose: This plan represents a composite of all Official Maps, to date, in the City. The
map designates existing or proposed streets or ways within the City that are targeted
for creation, expansion or other improvements. The Official Street Network Plan shall
initially consist of a series of four (4) separate maps, included in Appendix C, which shall
be deemed a part of the Beaufort Code.
2. Modification: The Official Street Network Plan may be modified or supplemented
per the procedure for Amendments and Rezonings (Section 9.16). The Metropolitan
Planning Commission (MPC ) will review the Official Street Network Plan on a
regular basis at intervals of every 6 months, or thereabouts. In addition, the maps will
be automatically updated as additional Official Maps are approved per the appropriate
process required by state law.
C. Specific Street Sections: The street sections noted in Appendix C show specific street designs
for the purposes of identifying future improvements by both the city and fronting property
owners. These sections depict the ideal arrangement and design of street elements.
1. Applicability: For any project that is considered Major Subdivision (Section 9.8.3),
Major Development Design Review (Section 9.8.2), or requires a Certificate of
Appropriateness, Major (9.10.2.A.2) and affects one whole block face, the fronting
property owner shall install all prescribed streetscape improvements as part of the
development project.
a. Exception: If similar elements as prescribed in the street section exist — e.g., onstreet
parking, sidewalk, tree plantings — the requirement to install the streetscape
element(s)shall be waived if those items meet the intent of the prescribed street
section, even if the existing items do not meet the exact requirements of that street
section. Example Scenarios: if a street section prescribes an 5 foot sidewalk, but a 4
foot sidewalk already exists, the existing sidewalk will satisfy the sidewalk requirement.
However, if the street section requires a 5 foot planting strip between the curb and the
sidewalk, and the 4 foot sidewalk is directly adjacent to the curb, this would not satisfy
the intent of the street section and would need to be reconstructed per the prescribed
standards.
2. Insufficient Right-of-Way Width
a. In the case of a street section adopted as part of an Official Map, where the width
of the existing right-of-way is insufficient to install the prescribed street section, the
fronting property owner may be required to reserve the appropriate amount of right7:
Land Development I 7.2 Street Network and Design Standards
A d o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | Ame n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8 T h e B e a u fo r t , S C Co d e 153
of-way (as measured from the centerline of the existing street). If the owner chooses
to dedicate and install the complete right-of-way, the cost of the improvements may
be compensated - see Section 7.2.1.E.
b. In the case of a street section that is not part of an Official Map, where the width of
the existing right-of-way is insufficient to install the prescribed street section, the
property owner is encouraged to reserve the appropriate amount of right-of-way
to complete the desired street section. If the owner chooses to dedicate and install
the complete right-of-way, the cost of the improvements may be compensated - see
Section 7.2.1.E.
c. Exceptions and Alternatives
i. Where available right-of-way — due to existing structures and topographic
conditions — do not permit the full section to be constructed, the
Administrator may adjust the required section.
ii. A different street section may be approved which accomplishes the same intent
in a smaller dimension.
D. Creation of New Right-of-Way
1. Where a future right-of-way is identified on an Official Map, and thus represented on
the Official Street Network Plan— these are indicated as “New Adopted Streets” — new
development shall reserve this area for the new street in the future. If access is needed to
the site in that location, the street shall be constructed in the general location shown.
a. Alternative Paths: The administrator may approve a different street configuration
if it the proposed development plan provides a similar amount and quality of
connectivity through the site. This is determined by evaluating one or more of the
following: number of connections, connections of specific site elements, and required
access to existing and proposed structures. For modification of the Official Street
Network Plan, See Section 7.2.1.B.2.
b. Street Standards: The future right-of-way shall conform to all of the street network
requirements of Section 7.2.2 below.
2. Where a new right-of-way that is not shown in the street regulating plan, is required as
part of a new development, it shall be designed with appropriate elements based on its
proposed location and zoning district. (See Appendix C).
E. Compensation: When a project is required to make off-site improvements within the existing
right-of-way, dedicate and/or improve a street with insufficient right-of-way, or install a
new street (be it public or private) per the requirements in Section C above, compensation
may be available. To the extent that the City has the authority and the ability, the Traffic
Impact fee for the project shall be reduced by the assessed value of the dedicated land and/
or construction cost of the right-of-way improvement. This may be done either as a direct
reduction, rebate, or reimbursement of fees.
7.2.2 STREET NETWORK REQUIREMENTS
A. Continuation of Adjoining Street System: The proposed street layout shall be coordinated
with the street system of the surrounding area to form an interconnected street pattern,
formalized by a platted public access easement. Adequate street connectivity shall be assessed
by the TRC, based on the ability of the proposed alignments to
1. permit multiple routes between origin and destination points,

154 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
2. diffuse traffic, and
3. shorten walking distances.
B. Block Sizes: Blocks shall be compact so that they are comfortably walkable and appropriate
for their context.
a. In T3-S zones, block sizes are flexible, but the perimeter shall not exceed 2,640 linear
feet (1/2 mile). An average block perimeter less than 2,000 feet is preferred.
b. In T3-N zones, block sizes are flexible, but the perimeter shall not exceed 1,700 linear
feet (1/3 mile). An average block perimeter less than 1,500 feet is preferred.
c. In T4, and T5 zones, blocks shall be no more than 400 feet on any side. An average
block length of 250-300 feet is preferred. The block perimeter shall not exceed 1,320
linear feet (¼-mile).
d. Exceptions may be made for natural elements such as wetlands, trees, topography,
and cultural resources, to be incorporated into the site design.
C. Street Stubs: New developments shall if practicable, connect to any existing street stubs from
adjacent properties and stub to all adjacent properties.
1. Exemptions: Street stubs shall not be required where the conditions listed below would
prevent connections:
a. Topographical conditions (pre-development slopes of 18% or greater)
b. Environmental conditions (marshes, floodplains, etc.)
c. Property shape
d. Property accessibility (existing platted subdivision with no stubs)
e. Incompatible adjacent land uses
2. Location: Where multiple connection opportunities exist, street stub connections shall
be prioritized in the site design as follows:
a. Adjacent parcels 20 acres or greater in size
b. Adjacent parcels that abut or are traversed by existing or proposed streets
c. Where the Street Network Diagram recommends a street connection (indicated as a
proposed street).
3. Design
a. Stub streets and streets intended for extension during future phases shall be
constructed to extend to the property line or as close to the line as practical.
b. It shall be the responsibility of the second development to construct the connection
to an existing stub street.
c. Stub streets shall not exceed 150 feet in length without a paved turnaround
(permanent or temporary).
d. Disclosure: The Final Subdivision Plan shall be recorded stating that future
connection is possible at any sub streets and streets intended for extension during
future phases. A clearly visible street sign may be erected at the end of the stub street
stating that the street is planned to connect to a future street.
D. Cul-de-sacs and Dead-end Streets: Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs are prohibited, unless
specifically approved by the TRC. In T3 and LI zones only, cul-de-sacs or other turn-arounds

turn,-around such as a cul-de-sac or close.
2. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround area which
shall be designed considering traffic usage, maintenance, and removal.
3. Alternative design solutions, such as a close (first preference), or a loop road cul-de-sac
(second preference) are preferable to a typical cul-de-sac.
4. Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and minimum paved
radius of 40 feet. When ample radii exist, cul-de-sacs shall contain a central planted
median.
5. Whenever cul-de-sac roads are created, at least one pedestrian access easement shall be
provided, to the extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head or road turnaround
and the sidewalk system of the closest adjacent road or pedestrian pathway. The access
easement shall be direct with a minimum width of 12 feet.
E. Gated Streets: New gated streets are not encouraged. However they may be permitted, at
the discretion of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, in T3-S zoning districts where
connection to the existing street grid is not practicable due to topography or existing
surrounding conditions. They may be permitted by the applicable Design Review Authority
when the access proposed to be gated is an alley or rear lane and is not the primary building
frontage.
F. Street Naming and Renaming: Proposed street names and number systems will be reviewed
by the administrator and the Beaufort County Emergency Management Department. No
duplicate/similar names are allowed, as determined by these agencies.
G. Reserved Strips Prohibited: Reserved strips at the terminus of a new street shall be
prohibited.
7.2.3 LOT ACCESS STANDARDS
A. Applicability: Any development that requires an access point (rear alley/lane or driveway)
for purposes of ingress and/or egress shall be subject to the provisions of this section. All new
accesses must be approved by the appropriate permitting authority. Access points may not be
installed on undeveloped property less than 2 acres.
B. Maximum Number: For single-family and two- and three-family dwellings, only one

2 - Additional driveways (in excess of 2) shall be permitted only after the applicant successfully demonstrates the
necessity for such additional driveways, as determined by the appropriate Design Review Body. Along arterial
roads and thoroughfares, such additional driveways shall be “right-in, right-out” driveways only.
C. Location and Spacing
1. Street Intersection: No curb or other access point shall be located closer than
a. 20 feet from the intersecting point of the 2 street right-of-way property lines involved
(or such lines extended in case of a rounded corner),

3. Corner Lots: Access points on corner lots shall be from the side (or secondary) street,
unless a shared curb cut on the main thoroughfare is existing or proposed.
4. Access to Lots from Major Thoroughfares: Driveways serving individual residential
lots shall not have direct access onto streets identified as Major Thoroughfares —as
identified on the second row of the chart in Section 7.2.3.C.2 — unless no alternative
means of access, such as alleys or parallel access roads, exists, and it is unreasonable or
impractical to require an alternative means of access.

a. In new subdivisions greater than 1 acre, alleys shall be provided for newly created lots
that meet any of the following criteria:
i. The lots are part of a block face with an average lot width of 60 feet or less at the
building setback line (excluding lots on cul-de-sacs).
ii. The lots are arranged around a Common Open Space.
iii. The lots front a collector or arterial road, regardless of the average lot width.
iv. The lots are intended for multi-family dwellings and/or mixed-use buildings.
b. In infill situations, the same standards apply as specified above, but only for
developments that include 4 or more contiguous lots, where one lot is a corner lot. In
the Historic District, the standards apply only to the Beaufort Conservation District;
the requirement may be waived at the discretion of the Historic Review Board.
F. Specific to Commercial Developments and Subdivisions
1. Out-parcels: Out-parcels for shopping, office, or industrial centers shall be limited to
internal access to the center, unless otherwise approved as part of a master development
plan. All driveways shall be paved from the road to the property line.
2. Abandoned Driveways: Abandoned driveways (i.e., curb cuts that are no longer used for
vehicular access and are physically blocked by structures) shall be closed, and the area shall
be restored to the typical cross section of the right-of-way.
7.2.4 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS
A. Street Section Design: The elements and widths of all proposed streets shall be in conformity
with the appropriate street Section designated in the Street Regulating Plan (Section 7.2.1 and
Appendix C).
B. Traffic Control and Signs: Traffic control and street name signs shall be installed at all street
intersections and other appropriate areas as determined by the applicant and street owner.
C. Sidewalks/Multi-use Paths: Where required per the Street Section in Appendix C, all
sidewalks or multi-use paths must be constructed concurrently with the street, or, if the street
is already constructed, prior to acceptance of any improvements. Exceptions to, or partial
waiver of, the requirement to install a sidewalk may be granted by the Planning Commission if

158 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
1. alternative pedestrian paths/bikeways have been or will be provided outside of the normal
right- of-way.
2. there are unusual topographic, vegetative, or other natural conditions to the extent that
strict adherence to said requirements would be unreasonable and not consistent with the
purposes and goals of this code.
D. Utility Easements: Utility easements which require a width of 8 feet or larger shall be located
in rear alleys or along the side or rear lot lines. Special permission to install utility easements
in other locations may be requested by the utility companies and is subject to approval by the
appropriate Design Review Body.
E. Special Consideration to Protect Protected Resources and other Natural Features: Street
layout and design shall give additional consideration to preserving protected resources and
enabling natural areas to be protected or minimally disturbed. Where streets are built in areas
that have protected resources or natural features, all utilities shall be placed within the street
right-of-way and under the street in order to avoid additional destruction of the natural features.
7.2.5 STREET TREE PLANTING REQUIREMENTS
A. Planting Areas: Planting strips and tree wells shall be established in accordance with the
width and plantings designated in the appropriate Street Section of the Street Regulating Plan
(7.2.1 and Appendix C).
B. Location and Number: Street trees should be planted in the location and per the spacing
specified for the corresponding street classification in Appendix C. However, where it is not
practical due, to the location of utilities or other site constraints, street trees may be planted on
private property adjacent to the right-of-way.
C. Tree Species: Overstory and understory trees as prescribed in this section reference Appendix
A.2 (Recommended Trees and Shrubs).
D. Minimum Tree Size: At the time of planting, young trees should be 2.5 inch caliper, with the
lower side of the crown a minimum of 6 feet above grade to avoid hazards to pedestrians.
7.3: STREET ENGINEERING STANDARDS
7.3.1 STREET DESIGN, CERTIFICATION, AND CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
A. Design Drawings and Certification: Professional engineers, registered in the state, shall
prepare plans, profiles, cross sections, and specifications for all subdivision roads and streets.
The engineers shall certify roads/streets are built to comply with the approved plans and
specifications. Cross sections shall be developed every 100 feet at intersections and break
points in grade. Cross sections shall show the complete rights-of-way including travel lanes,
shoulders, ditches, curb and gutter, and sidewalks and utility locations, as applicable.
B. Construction Specifications for Paved Streets: Street construction specifications for paved
streets shall be in compliance with the South Carolina Department of Transportation Standards.
7.3.2 TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
A. Applicability: A “traffic impact analysis” (TIA) shall be required for any development that
is shown — in the most recent Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual or any alternative approved by the engineering department — to generate more than
50 trips during the peak hour on the adjacent street(s).
1. A second phase, second subdivision, or addition that generates traffic beyond this
7: Land Development I 7.3: Street Engineering Standards
A d o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | Ame n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8 T h e B e a u fo r t , S C Co d e 159
threshold when taken as a whole shall also require a TIA, even though that development
does not qualify on its own.
2. A use shall not be changed without conducting a new TIA if the new use would generate
traffic beyond the 50 trips during peak hour threshold above. The administrator or TRC
may waive this requirement in unusual circumstances.
3. Exception: Development — except for Educational Facilities with greater than 100
students — on lots included in the Boundary Street Master Plan, adopted on August
28, 2006, and lots in the area bounded by Calhoun Street, Carteret Street, Bay Street,
and Ribaut Road, and lots zoned Limited Industrial (LI) , shall not be subject to the
requirements of this section.
B. Traffic Access Management Analysis: As part of the TIA process, the proposed development
shall have an “access analysis” undertaken by the administrator to ensure that sufficient access
to all proposed developments and subdivisions is achieved.
1. The standards in the South Carolina Department of Transportation’s “Access and
Roadside Management Standards Manual” (a.k.a. ARMS Manual) shall serve as a guide
for this analysis, which shall include identification of the following:
a. Access improvements that the applicant must install at his or her expense, such as
deceleration lanes,
b. The location of any curb cuts based on, but not limited to, sight distances, existing
roadway infrastructure, opposing driveways locations, and shared access,
c. Requirements for adequate driveway design, including, but not limited to, turning
radius and stacking distance.
2. The access requirements approved by the administrator shall be incorporated on
development or subdivision plans prior to their approval.
3. If an applicant is required to provide site-related traffic improvements, the cost of
implementing such improvements shall be borne by the applicant, and no such costs shall
be eligible for a credit or offset from any transportation impact fees unless specifically
permitted by the Development Fee Procedures - Beaufort County Code of Ordinances,
Chapter 82, Article VII or most recent version.
C. Traffic Impact Analysis Plan Preparation
1. The TIA shall be conducted by an engineer registered in South Carolina who is
experienced in the conduct of traffic analysis.
2. Prior to beginning the TIA, the applicant shall supply the city with the following:
a. A written narrative describing the proposed land use(s), size, and projected opening
date of the project and all subsequent phases
b. A site location map showing surrounding development within a one-half mile of the
property under development consideration
c. A proposed site plan or preliminary subdivision plat illustrating access to public or
private roads and connectivity to other contiguous developments
3. Prior to beginning the TIA, the applicant shall receive, in writing, the parameters to be
followed in the study, including the directional split of driveway traffic, trip distribution,
background traffic growth rate, previously approved but not completed projects, and the
intersections to be analyzed, along with any associated turning movement counts that are
available or discussed and approved by the TRC.

4. To review the TIA, the TRC will utilize updated trip generation information, available information
on land use, travel patterns, and traffic conditions, and shall consult with the SCDOT.
D. Plan Contents
1. Phased Developments: All phases of a development are subject to review, and all traffic
plans for the entire development shall be integrated with the overall traffic analysis. A
TIA for a specific phase of development shall be applicable to the phase of development
under immediate review. However, each phase of development shall expand and provide
detailed analysis at the development plan stage beyond the estimates provided for at the
concept plan or master plan stage.
2. Infrastructure Analysis: The adequacy of the roads that the development will be accessed
from shall be assessed in the TIA. Recommendations for improvements shall be made.
The relative share of the capacity created shall be broken down as follows: development
share, other developments’ share, any existing overcapacity, and capacity available for
future growth.
3. Required Elements of the TIA
a. A site plan or subdivision plat identifying accesses to and from existing or proposed
streets and intersections, along with all opposing intersections across adjacent streets
b. Description of the proposed development, including the type and intensity of
proposed land use(s) including, but not limited to: the number of residential units by
type, the number of existing and proposed lots, the type of proposed nonresidential
development and the amount of such development measured by gross floor area
or other appropriate unit of measurement, the general size and type of accessory
development or facilities, and, for nonresidential development, adequate information
to identify the appropriate land use category for trip generation.
c. Projected vehicular trips to and from the completed development during a.m. and
p.m. peak hour — trip rates shall be taken from ITE Manual or alternatively, an
applicant may elect to perform, at his own expense, a “trip generation study” which
may be submitted as part of the traffic impact analysis plan. Such trip generation
study shall be subject to the review and verification of the TRC and engineer.
For proposed uses not specifically listed in the ITE Manual, and for which a trip
generation study has not been performed, the designated engineer(s) shall determine
the most appropriate trip generation rate. The TRC shall make the determination
of the appropriate trip generation rate, from whatever the source. The percentage
of pass-by trips, if used in the plan, shall be included, as well as the source of this
information.
d. A written narrative setting forth the assumptions upon which any projection was
made in developing the traffic impact analysis plan shall be included in the analysis. If
the assumptions are derived from the ITE Manual, the materials shall be referenced
and properly cited. If the assumptions are not from the ITE Manual, appropriate
excerpts from other reliable transportation planning resources shall be included in
the study, and reasons underlying the assumptions shall be stated in the narrative.
e. The TIA shall review access to the site. The adequacy of the entrance design shall
be evaluated and recommendations made on acceleration and deceleration lanes,
left-turn lanes, or signalizations shall be part of the TIA. Educational facilities shall
include pick-up and drop-off plans and analysis of the impact on the surrounding
streets and intersections.

f. The TIA shall review the number and types of curb cuts that are permitted.
In particular, the TIA shall assess the connection of the property to adjoining
properties. Where the use, scale of development, or size of adjoining properties
is such that trips would be anticipated between the proposed use and the other
properties, the TIA shall make recommendation on interconnections. The TIA shall
recommend interconnections to provide a smooth flow of traffic between uses along
arterials and collector roads to ensure that as much traffic as possible uses secondary
roads, rather than major roads, for short trips.
g. The TIA shall be based on intersection analysis procedures for signalized
intersections as identified in the most current edition transportation research board’s
highway capacity manual, and/or the last update that analyses and emulates these
procedures by means of computer software, if available. The results of any required
analysis/computer analysis shall, at a minimum, indicate compliance or variance from
the Traffic Goals (Section 7.3.3.M).
h. The intersections that must be analyzed in the study are identified as:
i. any intersection that serves as a development’s point of access. This will include
intersections of public and/or private roads with major arterials, and driveways
offering direct access.
ii. the first major intersection as identified by the city engineer on both side of the
development’s point of access.
iii. other intersections on major arterials if development generates more than 50
a.m. or p.m. peak hour trips to that intersection, or if the intersection’s level of
service or demand is significantly impacted by site related traffic.
iv. unsignalized intersections and access drives — these shall be considered if
development impacts are anticipated. The plan must include the results of
an analysis of the operating conditions of critical intersections and/or all
intersections identified in the concept plan. The analysis shall reflect the
projected condition of these intersections and movements, based on the
scheduled opening date of the development. Other phases of the development, if
they can be reasonably determined, shall be considered as well.
E. Mitigation Plan Required: If the initial analysis indicates that the city’s adopted Traffic
Service Level Goals (Section 7.3.2.M) will be not be met, a mitigation plan must be prepared,
based on additional analysis. The mitigation plan must show how the city’s Traffic Service
Level Goals are addressed as mitigated. Applicants will be responsible for mitigating the traffic
impacts at any intersection affected by a proposed development.
1. If a traffic signal is recommended, the TIA shall provide information that:
a. clearly indicates the need for a traffic signal.
b. assesses the ability of other existing, planned, or proposed public roads to
accommodate the new traffic at a location other than the main highway in the
vicinity of the proposed development.
c. describes in detail how a specific development will affect the study area
transportation system.
d. provides documentation of appropriate South Carolina Manual of Uniform Traffic
Control Devices signal warrant satisfaction.
e. gives design geometry of the private road that is consistent with that of public road
7: Land Development I 7.3: Street Engineering Standards
162 Th e B e a u fo r t , S C Code Ad o p t e d - J u n e 2 7 , 2 0 1 7 | A m e n d e d J u l y 1 0 , 2 0 1 8
intersections, including curbs, appropriate lane widths, pavement markings, and vertical alignment.
Other roadway factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, speed, type of highway, grades,
sight distance, existing level of service, conflicting accesses, and the effect of future traffic signal systems.
f. provides an approach-throat length for the road to ensure the movement of vehicles entering the
site will not be impeded by conditions within the development, and ensure that all signal-spacing
requirements are adequately met.
2. The desirable spacing of signalized intersections on principal arterials is the SCDOT, county, or city
standards. The TRC may recommend to SCDOT the installation of a traffic signal at locations where,
using SCDOT standards, spacing is inappropriate due to topography, existing or proposed road layout,
documented accident history, unique physical constraints, existing or proposed land use patterns, or
requirements to achieve specific objectives for highway segment designations, as shown in any locally
adopted land use or transportation plan, approved city or county transportation plan, or approved
transportation policy.
3. Signal spacing concerns may be ameliorated in the following ways:
a. A proposed private road that may otherwise be considered for the installation of a traffic signal may be
replaced by an on-site route or a frontage road that directs traffic to or from a nearby public road.
b. A private road that is being considered for traffic signal installation may be required to connect to the
existing or planned local road system to allow uses of surrounding properties.
c. An existing or proposed intersection may be relocated.
d. A shared private road may be required to serve the needs of the multiple properties.
4. A traffic signal progression analysis is required if the proposed location is closer than the SCDOT
standards, given the presence of existing signals or the possible existence of identified future signals
proposed as part of a highway signal system. A traffic signal progression analysis for all new, revised, or
planned traffic signal systems on state highways shall be performed using methods, models, computer
software, data sources, roadway segment length, and assumptions approved by the TRC. The roadway
segment, analyzed to the extent possible, shall include all traffic signals in the existing or future traffic signal
system. The progression analysis shall
a. demonstrate acceptable existing and future traffic signal systems operation that may include the
morning peak, evening peak, midday period, and other appropriate time period during any day of the
week, adjusted for peak season, for cycle lengths and travel speeds approved by the TRC.
b. provide for a progressed traffic band speed no more than 5 mph (8 km/h) below the existing posted
speed for both directions of travel during the off-peak periods, nor more than 10 mph (16 km/h) below
the existing posted speed during peak periods. Approval by the TRC is required where speeds deviate
more than the above.
c. demonstrate that sufficient vehicle storage is available at all locations within the traffic signal system
without encroaching on the functional boundaries of adjacent lanes and signalized intersections. The
functional boundary of an intersection shall be determined in discussion with the TRC, based on
existing or projected conditions.
d. provide a common cycle length with adequate pedestrian crossing times at all signalized intersections.
e. provide a progression bandwidth as large as that required, or as presently exists, for through traffic on
the federal or state highway at the most critical intersection within the roadway segment. The most
critical intersection is the intersection carrying the highest through volume per lane.
5. The traffic signal progression analysis shall be supplemented by a traffic engineering report that also considers
highway capacity and safety of the roadway segment under consideration. Traffic volumes, intersection

geometry, and lane balance, considered at all locations, shall be appropriate for the present and identified
future conditions, which are usually considered to include the year of completion, and 5 years into the future.
F. Summary: A clear and concise summary of recommended improvements that can serve as an executive
summary is required.
G. TIA Review: The TRC shall review all TIAs as part of the applicable Design Review phase— see Section 9.8
and 9.9 for appropriate process. Final TIAs shall be approved prior to the applicant submitting a Project Permit
application (Section 9.5).
H. Application: A TIA shall be submitted to the TRC. Coordination with other entities in the county
government or South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) shall be the responsibility of the city.
I. Completeness: The TRC shall determine whether a TIA is complete. Thorough and complete TIAs are the
responsibility of the applicant. Failure by the applicant to provide a complete TIA may result in review delays
for their plat or plan.
J. Action on TIA: The TRC must first approve the TIA in regard to completeness and accuracy. Following review
of the required impact analysis plan, TRC shall recommend action as follows:
1. Approval of the TIA as submitted,
2. Approval of the TIA with conditions or modifications as part of the development review and approval
process. An acceptable TIA with traffic mitigation measures may include the reduction of the density or
intensity of the proposed development, phasing of the proposed development to coincide with state and/or
county-programmed transportation improvements, applicant-provided transportation improvements, fees
in lieu of construction, or any other reasonable measures to ensure that the adopted traffic service-level goals
are met. If mitigation is required, it shall be required as a condition of any approval from the city.
K. Timing of Implementation: If a traffic mitigation program is part of an approved TIA, the developer may be
required to place a performance bond on all traffic mitigation improvements required as a result of his project.
This requirement may arise if the timing of the improvements needs to be synchronized with other scheduled
improvements anticipated for the area.
L. Responsibility for Costs of Improvements: The costs of implementation of an approved mitigation program
shall be the responsibility of the applicant. No certificates of zoning compliance or building permits shall be
issued unless provisions of the TIA are met.
M. Traffic Service Level Goals: The average stop time delay in seconds per vehicle for each intersection determined
to be critical to the TIA for the proposed development shall be compared to the city’s adopted traffic service level
goal of “D” for the average delay for all vehicles at any signalized intersection during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
7.4: COMMUNITY GREEN SPACE AND OPEN SPACE

7.4.4 DESIGN OF COMMUNITY GREEN SPACE AND OPEN SPACES
A. Design Standards for Community Green Space and Open Space: Land used as Community
Green Space and Open Space shall meet the following design standards:
1. Location
a. Where relevant and appropriate, the land shall be located so as to be readily
accessible and usable by residents and users of the development. To the maximum
extent practicable, a portion of the open space shall provide focal points for the
development.
b. Common space set aside for children’s play areas and other recreational activities shall
be clearly visible from the dwelling units on the site.
c. The land shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be located to adjoin, extend, and
enlarge any open areas, trails, parks, or other open space resources that exist or are
planned within or adjacent to the development.
2. Provision in Multi-Phase Developments: In multi-phase developments, open space
Manuals may be calculated either by phases, or by collectively looking at the development
as a whole.
B. Accessory Structure Standards: All accessory structures within parks and open spaces —
including, but not limited to, restrooms, open-air pavilions, gazebos, picnic shelters, and
outdoor theaters — shall not be subject to the physical requirements of the building form or
siting standards in Article 2 (Map and Districts). They shall be designed to be consistent with
the character of the district in which they are located. Such consistency may require accessory
structures to maintain building setbacks, frontage, massing, disposition, and character similar
to adjacent development as determined by the administrator.
7.4.5 OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF COMMUNITY GREEN SPACE AND OPEN SPACE SPACE
A. Open space areas or other community facilities shall be preserved and maintained in
accordance with the approved
1. Development Design, in accordance with Section 9.8,
2. Special Exception, in accordance with Section 9.13, or
3. Subdivision, in accordance with Section 9.9, whichever is appropriate.
B. Provision must be made by the property owner to ensure preservation and long term
maintenance and management of Community Green Space and Open Spaces through one of
the following mechanisms:
1. Conveyance of the land to a property owners’ or homeowners’ association that holds the
land in common ownership and will be responsible for managing and maintaining it for
its intended purposes
2. Conveyance of the land to a third-party beneficiary, such as a nonprofit environmental or
civic organization, that is organized for, capable of, and willing to accept responsibility for
managing and maintaining the land for its intended purpose
3. Dedication of the land to the city or other appropriate public agency that is organized for,
capable of, and willing to accept responsibility for managing and maintaining the land for
its intended purposes

B. Conventional districts: 50 feet minimum
8.2.3 DEVELOPMENT AND REMOVAL OF VEGETATION PROHIBITED
The entire buffer shall be undisturbed. Indigenous vegetation removal in the tidal area buffer is
limited to that necessary to provide for a structure/activity permitted by this subsection and to
provide for reasonable sight lines, with the following exceptions:
A. Paths, steps, decks, open-air structures (up to 80 square feet), yard sculpture and furniture,
docks, playground equipment, paths and streets and sidewalks accessible to the public, erosion
control devices (not stormwater ponds), and any other elements linked to the critical area that
are permitted by OCRM are permitted in the Critical Area Buffer.
B. Lots in a Transect-based zoning district, with bulkheads existing at the time of adoption of
this ordinance, are exempt from the provisions of this section.
8.3: STORMWATER
8.3.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of these standards is to control the adverse effects of post-development stormwater
runoff, and non-point and point source pollution associated with new development and
redevelopment by fulfilling the following objectives:
A. Calibrate these controls based on the context of the site to ensure that walkable, urban
patterns of development are favored as the primary Best Management Practices (BMPs).
B. Design BMPs to be shared between multiple parcels and considered at a block or regional
level where possible.
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from new development or redevelopment to the
maximum extent practical for the applicable design storms in order to reduce flooding, siltation,
and erosion, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels, marshes and aquatic habitats.
D. Minimize increases in non-point and point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff
from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality.
E. Minimize the total volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during and
following development in order to replicate pre development hydrology to the maximum extent
practicable through the use of structural and nonstructural stormwater management BMPs.
F. Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria
for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality so as to meet local,
state and federal water quality standards in affected watershed areas.

5. Agricultural and Silviculture activity
6. Work by agencies or property owners required to mitigate emergency flooding
conditions — if possible, emergency work should be approved by the duly appointed
officials in charge of emergency preparedness or emergency relief. Property owners
performing emergency work will be responsible for any damage or injury to persons or
property caused by their unauthorized actions. Property owners will restore the site of
the emergency work to its approximate pre-emergency condition as soon as practicable
following the end of the emergency period.
C. Specific to Golf Courses: New golf courses are required to comply with the latest version of
the county’s “Manual for Stormwater BMPs,” or the current version of the city’s “Stormwater
Manual”, and all site runoff volume and water quality control and drainage planning and design
requirements. However, both golf courses and private lagoons shall be exempt from the flood
control requirements of BMP manual concerning control design, subject to clear demonstration
by the design engineer that no damaging flooding will occur during the 100-year/24-hour storm.
D. Private Drainage Systems Not City Responsibility: Where private drainage systems and
easements have been previously approved as private facilities, prior to the adoption of this code,
as well as all new development and redevelopment, and have not been accepted by the City, such
facilities shall not become the city’s responsibility. Such systems shall be denoted as “private”
on any subdivision plat or land development plan, as well as in the respective covenants and
agreements that control or follow the property.
E. Irrigation: Irrigation, as required per Section 5.6.1.B, should use rainwater to irrigate when possible.
8.3.3 STANDARDS
A. Applicable Stormwater Manual: Where required, all development shall provide adequate
drainage, peak rate, volume and stormwater pollution control in accordance with Sections 2
and 5 of the version of the county’s BMPs manual in effect at the adoption of this code, or the
current version of the city’s “Stormwater Manual” which is incorporated herein by reference.
When adopted, the city’s “Stormwater Manual” will replace the County’s BMPs manual. If an
standard is specified in Section 8.3 of this Code, this Code takes precedence over the applicable
Stormwater Manual.
B. Stormwater Quality and Volume Control: In an effort to achieve compliance with the
percentages listed in the table below, all development will control Volume by retention and
other methods to the maximum extent technically feasible (METF) so that post-development
stormwater runoff levels will not exceed pre-development runoff levels for the 95th percentile
storm event, which is currently 1.95 inches. Standards for volume and runoff pollution load
control are based on anti-degradation requirements tied to the “effective impervious area”
values as noted in the table below:
LOADS EFFECTIVE IMPERVIOUS AREA
Runoff Volume Control 10%
Phosphorus and Nitrogen Levels 10%
Bacteria 5%
C. Stormwater Quantity Control: The design storm criteria to be used in calculations for the
sizing of peak attenuation and volume control BMPs is to limit the post-development runoff
for multiple storm events including the 2-, 10-, and 25-year/24-hour storms to the predevelopment
rates.
D. All development and redevelopment shall utilize and integrate stormwater BMPs that are

appropriate to the site context and contribute to the overall character of a proposal. BMPs
implemented at the development scale shall be integrated into civic and open space networks
to the maximum extent possible.
1. Stormwater BMPs shall be selected in keeping with the applicable district as established
in Article 2 of this code.
2. Stormwater BMPs shall be selected to respond to the soil conditions - soil type and
infiltration rate - found on site.
3. Where possible, stormwater BMPs should be shared between multiple parcels and
considered at a block or regional level.
8.3.4 BMP PLANNING AND SELECTION
A. Planning: Review of stormwater management for development and redevelopment is a
vital portion of the overall site design, therefore planning for stormwater management, in
accordance with this section shall commence at the time of initial project inception and
presentation to the Technical Review Committee (TRC). Review of stormwater management
will continue to be undertaken during all phases of the development review process.
B. BMP Selection: Stormwater BMPs shall be selected in keeping with the applicable district, as
indicated in the table below. Additionally, stormwater BMPs shall be selected to respond to
the site’s location within a volume-sensitive watershed, according to the worksheets provided
in the applicable stormwater manual.

4. Comply with Other City Policies: Water collected from rainwater cisterns shall be used
in a manner that complies with city policies and regulations on rainwater harvesting.
8.4: ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
8.4.1 ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
A. Intent of District: It is the intent of this section to protect the many significant archeological
resources of the City of Beaufort.
B. General Requirements: The following requirements shall be adhered to:
1. All proposed developments, other than single-family and 2-3 family units, along with
major subdivisions, shall be required to have a determination from the Administrator
indicating whether or not the location of the proposed development contains any
archeological resources. These resources shall be identified — by the city through existing
surveys, historic maps and papers, and other information available from the South
Carolina Department of Archives and History and the South Carolina Institute of
Archeology and Anthropology — as being listed in, or having been determined eligible,
or potentially eligible, for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, as well as
those areas identified in the document entitled “Cartographic Survey of Historic Sites in
Beaufort County, South Carolina”, dated June 30, 1992 (and amended from time to time)
as having the potential to yield significant archeological information.
2. If the Administrator determines that the proposed development contains, or is likely
to contain archeological resources, then a professional archeological survey shall be
completed by qualified personnel to determine the existence of the resource and to
evaluate the significance of the resource. The survey shall then be submitted to the
Administrator for review.
3. If the area of the proposed development has been previously surveyed for archeological
resources, and the survey report is available and meets the standards set out in this section,
the applicant will not be required to perform another survey, but merely submit or
reference that report to the Administrator.
4. If the Administrator determines that the proposed development parcel contains
a potential resource, a professional archaeologist approved by the South Carolina
State Historic Preservation Office (SC SHPO), shall complete and submit to the
Administrator the documentation as outlined in this section. Identified resources shall
be preserved and/or the effects of the proposed project mitigated in accordance with
the applicable federal and state laws and guidelines. Further, for any contemplated
construction that would significantly affect the setting or vista of any archeological
resource in a manner that would compromise the resource’s eligibility to the National
Register of Historic Places, the Historic Review Board shall review the project and may
require that the development plans be altered to mitigate or avoid such effects.
5. All requests to the applicant by the Administrator for surveys, documentation, and
mitigation shall include a letter outlining the justification for such requests.

C. Prohibited Acts: No person may excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or deface, or
attempt to excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or deface any archeological or historic
resource located in the City of Beaufort unless such activity is pursuant to a permit issued by
the Administrator. Any person violating the article shall be subject to penalties prescribed in
this Code and additional penalties prescribed by the South Carolina Code of Laws.
D. Accidental Findings: If, during the course of a construction project, any historic artifacts
or structures are encountered, work must stop immediately and the Administrator must be
notified.
E. Intensive Level Archeological Survey
1. The Administrator will officially notify, in writing, the applicant of the need for an
Intensive Level Survey. This survey must meet the criteria set forth by theSC SHPO’s
“Guidelines and Standards for Archeological Investigation.”
2. The applicant will notify the Administrator who will be authorized to undertake the
survey. The survey will be executed by qualified personnel, as required by the SC SHPO’s
Standards.
3. The findings of the intensive level survey will be submitted to the Administrator.
4. Upon receipt of the intensive level survey final report, and any necessary visual records,
the Administrator will either issue a permit of approval for the proposed development
project or deny approval of the project until the development plans can be altered to
mitigate or avoid any negative impact.
F. Mitigation
1. Determination of Adverse Effects: Upon receipt of an Intensive Level Archeological
Survey final report, documenting archeological resources, and/or the South Carolina
statewide survey forms documenting historic resources, the Administrator will determine
whether the proposed project will have an adverse effect on archeological resources listed
in, or eligible for listing in, the National Register of Historic Places. The Administrator
may choose to bring the project to the Historic Review Board to make the determination
as to whether or not adverse effects exists.
a. There is No Adverse Effect: If the Administrator determines that the project will not
have an adverse effect on archeological resources listed in, or eligible for listing in, the
National Register of Historic Places, he/she will issue a permit of approval for the
proposed project.
b. There is an Adverse Effect: If the Administrator determines that the project will
have an adverse effect on archeological resources, listed in, or eligible for listing in,
the National Register of Historic Places, he/she will deny a permit of approval for
the proposed project until the development plans can be altered to mitigate or avoid
adverse effects.
2. Mitigation of Adverse Effects: The applicant shall enter into a Memorandum of
Agreement with the City of Beaufort that describes mitigation measures that will be
required prior to the issuance of a permit of approval. The Administrator shall stress
to the applicant that preservation-in-place of a significant resource is the preferred
mitigation method. Mitigation may include
a. Preservation-In-Place: Preservation-in-place of an archeological resource means
avoiding the resource, which protects it from drainage, destruction, vandalism,
or deterioration and may include measures such as covenants and easements, the

8.5.1 SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS
WIND ENERGY TYPES DIAGRAM SPECIFICS ZONING
DISTRICT
1. Wind Farm: A series of wind turbines that are ground mounted. This
is considered an accessory use Care should be taken installing wind turbines
near inhabited areas, as they tend to generate a steady white noise.
Setbacks: Turbines must be set back
a minimum of 50 feet from any T3,
T4 or T5 zoning district. They must
be located behind the site’s primary
structure.
T1, LI
2. Horizontal Access Wind Turbine: A wind turbine with its
rotor on the horizontal axis, similar to an airplane propeller. These turbines
are suited for the more rural T-zones because they generally require a large
(20 foot) radius for the rotating blades. In addition, the head must rotate in
order to receive wind from any direction.
Quantity: 1 per 4,000 square feet of
lot area
T3-S: Power output limited to 10kw
All other zones: Power output
limited to 100kw
T1, T3-S,RMX,
IC, LI
3. Vertical Access Wind Turbine: A wind turbine with its rotor
on the vertical axis. Blades are usually helical and the device is usually more
compact than the horizontal axis wind turbine. It does not have to rotate
to face the prevailing wind. It is suited for the more urban T-zones because
it is significantly smaller than the horizontal axis type — sometimes only
4-5 feet in diameter — and less noisy. These are designed to operate with
non-directional wind current, which makes them easier to accommodate and
more attractive in urban areas when in proximity to buildings. For further
information, see www.quietrevolution.com.
Quantity: 1 per1,000 square
feet of roof area
T3: Power output limited
to 10kw
All other zones: Power
output limited to 100kw
T3,T4, T5,
RMX, IC,, LI
4. Public Furniture: Applications where wind turbines may be
located within a public right-of-way.
Location: Must be
incorporated into approved
street section (see Appendix
C).
T4, T5, RMX, IC
A. Applicability: Wind turbines are considered accessory uses and are permitted in the zoning districts stated
in the above chart. Any structure in the historic district that is visible from the street must be approved by the
Historic District Review Board (Section 10.7).
B. Location and Setback:
1. No small wind energy facilities shall be located between a principal building and any adjacent streets.
2. Setbacks shall be the same as the primary structure unless noted otherwise in the chart above. This includes
setbacks for guy wires and other support devices if needed.
3. Wind Farms shall not be permitted in T1 districts adjacent to the historic district.
C. Height: The system shall comply with the maximum height standards for the zone in which it is located. Units
may be angled but shall not be elevated above the roofline of the structure on which it is mounted.
D. Sound: Sound produced by the wind turbine under normal operating conditions, as measured at a lot line, shall

not exceed 55 dBA. The 55 dBA sound level, however, may be exceeded during short-term
events that occur beyond the property owner’s control, such as utility outages and/or severe
wind storms.
E. Appearance: The wind turbine and tower shall be painted or finished in the color originally
applied by the manufacturer, or a matte neutral color (e.g., gray, white, or galvanized steel).
F. Blade Clearance: The blade tip or vane of any small wind energy facility shall have a
minimum ground clearance of 15 feet above grade, as measured at the lowest point of the arc
of the blades.
G. Lighting: No illumination of the turbine or tower shall be allowed, unless required by the FAA.
H. Access to Tower: Any climbing rungs shall be removed to a height of 12 feet above grade.
I. Signage Prohibited: Signage visible from any public street is prohibited, except for
manufacturer’s or installer’s identification, appropriate warning signs, or owner identification
not to exceed 40 square feet.
J. Abandonment: On determining that a small wind energy facility has been inoperable for 180
days or more, the Administrator shall send the property owner notice requiring restoration of
the system to operating order within 180 days after receiving the notice. If the owner fails to
restore the system to operating condition within the authorized time frame, the owner shall be
required, at the owner’s expense, to remove the wind turbine from the tower for safety reasons.
If the owner fails to remove the wind turbine from the tower, the city may pursue legal action
to have the wind turbine removed at the owner’s expense.

A. Applicability: Solar energy systems are considered accessory uses and are permitted in the
Zoning Districts stated in the above chart. Any structure in the Historic District that is visible
from the street must be approved by the Historic District Review Board (Section 10.7).
B. Height: The system shall comply with the maximum height standards for the zone in which it
is located. Units may be angled but shall not be elevated above the roofline of the structure on
which it is mounted.
C. Nonconforming Structure-Height: Where an existing structure exceeds the applicable height

provided the system extends no more than 5 feet above the roof surface.
D. Easements: The property owner shall be responsible for negotiating with other landowners in the vicinity to
establish any solar easement designed to protect solar access for the solar energy collection system.
8.5.3 FOOD PRODUCTION
FOOD PRODUCTION TYPES DIAGRAM SPECIFICS ZONING
DISTRICT
1. Farm: A primary or secondary use for a property. See Section 3.2
for primary use applications. Typically, a farm is a parcel of land where
the majority of the acreage is devoted to crop production. T1, T3, LI, IC
2. Vegetable Garden: S small portion of a residential parcel
devoted to growing food.
Location: These are typically
situated behind the primary
structure. In T3 zones, they may
also be in the front, provided that
they are well-maintained.
T3,T4, IC
3. Community Garden (a.k.a. Allotment Garden):
A mid-block area, typically divided into plots for the surrounding
residents to grow food. These gardens provide a locus of recreation
and sociability greater than that of the private yard, being one of the
so-called third places.
Management: These are not
privately owned, and are typically
managed by a municipality, nonprofit,
or association. T3, T4, T5,
RMX, IC
4. Urban Farm: An area fronted by houses used for growing crops.
It may be leased to one farmer, or split into plots for use by the residents.
These may be temporarily created on vacant lots, or planned as part of
block redevelopments or new neighborhoods.
Management: These are not
privately owned, and are typically
managed by a municipality, nonprofit,
or association. T4, T5, RMX, IC
5. Green Roofs & Container Gardens: Areas within and
on a building/parking area, utilized for growing spaces. Green roofs
consist of areas on tops of flat roofs that are used for gardens. They also
mitigate carbon emissions and reduce storm water runoff. Container
gardens, such as window boxes or balcony gardens, create small places
for food production while enhancing the urban realm.
T4, T5, RMX,
IC, LI
This table shows ways of incorporating types of local food production in different zoning districts. Cities are increasingly allowing
urban agriculture for household use, to encourage lower-cost food supplies and reduction in the energy consumption for
food transport.
A. Applicability: Food production is considered an accessory uses, except as noted above in “Farms,” and is
permitted in the zoning districts stated in the above chart.
B. Open Space Requirement: These food production areas may be counted toward the Civic/Open Space
allocation if they are open to the neighborhood at predictable hours or are visible from an adjacent Civic/Open
Space in a way that contributes to the enjoyment of that Civic/Open Space (Section 7.4.3)

C. Location and Setback: These may encroach into any side and rear setbacks. They may
encroach into front setbacks in T3 districts, and in other districts, at the discretion of the
Administrator. Associated structures must meet the setback requirements for accessory
structures per the zoning district (Sections 2.4.1.C and 2.4.2.D).

9.3.1 APPLICATION ELEMENTS
A. Site Analysis: A site analysis is intended to identify forest stands or trees of a uniform size
and species, specimen trees of varying sizes and species, particularly free standing or opengrown
or field grown trees, a distinctive tree line or forest edge, existing watercourses and
floodplains, previously documented federal- or state-recognized endangered species habitats,
and areas of historic, cultural, or archeological significance. (See Section 8.3 as applicable.)
This requirement provides the city and the applicant the ability to evaluate the proposed
development in order to preserve existing resources and to improve the appearance of the
development proposed. It is the expectation that readily available spatial data, including GIS
information, will be sufficient for this survey.
B. Sketch Plan: The sketch plan shall show in simple line drawing form the proposed layout
of streets, lots, buildings, civic spaces, tree coverage, and other features in relation to existing
conditions, based upon the size of the tract proposed for development. Sketch Plans shall be
reviewed as binding documents for Certificates of Compliance, and for any other permits
or approvals for which the Administrator requires only a Sketch Plan to be submitted with
the application. Sketch Plans shall be used for non-binding review for all other development
application processes in which they are required.
C. Site Plan (syn. Preliminary Plat): The site plan is intended to provide a detailed twodimensional
drawing that illustrates all of the required site features, including buildings*,
parking areas*, street locations, street sections, rights-of-way, property lines and setbacks,
required or proposed Critical Area buffers, trees proposed to remain and to be removed and
tree protection zones, site landscaping and lighting* (in conceptual form), and all related
development calculations (e.g., density, proposed building areas, number of parking spaces,
estimated impervious surface, proposed tree coverage, percentage of open space) in sufficient
detail to show compliance with this Code. When Specimen or Landmark Trees are proposed
to be preserved or removed, an Arborist Report is required per Section 5.3.2.B. Detailed
engineering drawings such as subsurface utilities (e.g., water and sewer) and calculations for
on-site stormwater facilities are not required for Site Plans. *When a Site Plan is being used as
a Preliminary Plat for a Subdivision, these elements are not required to be shown.
D. Construction Documents: The construction documents for development design review
and subdivision plans shall constitute a full and complete set of engineered drawings
necessary for final permitting and horizontal and vertical construction. This includes detailed
landscaping plans, lighting plans, grading and drainage plans, and stormwater calculations.
E. As-Built Drawings: The as-built drawings shall show the final installed conditions and
specifications for all public infrastructure. The designer of the infrastructure shall certify,
under seal, that the installed infrastructure is in compliance with the approved plans and
designs and with the requirements of this Code. A final inspection and approval by the
Administrator shall occur before the release of any performance securities.
F. Final Plat: The final plat shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor licensed to practice in
the State of South Carolina, and shall meet the requirements of the Beaufort County Register
of Deeds Office. The Final Plat shall constitute an accurate survey of the entire phase as shown
on the approved site plan and shall include all the relevant notes and certifications.
G. Building Elevations for Design Review: For certain applications, it may be necessary
to submit scaled drawings of each elevation visible from a public street or civic space. These
drawings shall be in color and shall accurately represent the building heights, floor levels, and
building materials, and shall include written identification of building materials. In addition,
the Administrator may require a physical model or up to three drawings from different
perspectives that show how the building fits into the context of the block.

9.4: ZONING PERMIT
9.4.1 APPLICABILITY
Only Required Permit: A zoning permit certifying compliance with this Code shall be the only type of approval
required for the following activities:
A. Home Occupations as regulated by Section 3.4.3 (Home Occupations — Major and Minor)
B. Temporary uses that do not materially affect the area’s natural environment, parking requirements,
transportation patterns, public health, or economic values. (See Section 3.11.3 Temporary Uses)
C. Conditional uses not requiring a building permit
D. Special events
E. Changes of use, and any uses permitted with additional standards per Article 3 (Land Use Provisions)
F. Removal of trees as regulated in Section 5.4 (Tree Removal)
9.4.2 PROCESS AND APPROVAL
A. Process Type: Administrative
B. Pre-Application Procedure: None
C. Required Application Information: See Administrator
D. Public Notification: None
E. Determination of Compliance: Once an application is deemed complete by the
Administrator, the Administrator shall review the application and approve or deny it based
on compliance with the standards contained in this Code.
F. Appeals: Appeals of zoning permit applications denied by the Administrator shall be taken
to the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the decision, in accordance with the
procedures found in Section 9.15 (Administrative Appeals).
G. Permit Validity: Upon the approval of the zoning permit, the applicant shall have 6
months take action on the approval. If no action is taken, the permit becomes null and void,
and the applicant shall resubmit.
1. Exception: Tree Removal Permits have no expiration.
H. Permit Extension: The Administrator may grant a single extension of up to 6 months
upon submittal by the applicant of sufficient justification for the extension. Permits issued
for temporary uses may be renewed only if it is determined that said use is clearly of a
temporary nature, will cause no traffic congestion, and would not create a nuisance to
surrounding uses.

J. Licensed Specialty Contractor(s) May Be Required: Where any local ordinances or any provision of
the SCCL require that work be done by a licensed specialty contractor of any kind, no Project Permit for such
work shall be issued unless it is to be performed by such licensed specialty contractor. It shall further be the
contractor’s responsibility to conform to all local ordinances and state building codes for all installations or
repairs of a building or utility system.
K. Permit Validity: Any Project Permit shall become null and void unless the work approved by the permit is
commenced within 180 days after the date of issuance. No work shall be considered to have commenced for the
purposes of this paragraph until an inspection has been made and recorded. If after commencement the work
is discontinued for a period of 180 days, the permit shall immediately expire. Extensions of up to 180 days per
request may be granted by the Administrator, but shall be requested in writing prior to expiration of the permit.

2. Major: Discretionary review by the HRB shall apply to all other applications for Certificates of
Appropriateness.
3. Design Exception: Design Exceptions shall be
used to modify any dimensional standards or design
requirements, found in Articles 2 and 4, for development
projects that have unique characteristics that justify a
deviation from the underlying standards. Such deviations
are intended to provide flexibility from the underlying
standards to permit compatible development patterns
which are indicative of the surrounding area and/or
use an innovative approach or technique. The process
is intended to provide the minimum relief necessary
to create a more innovative and context-sensitive
development consistent with the City’s adopted
plans. This tool is not intended to circumvent the map
amendment (rezoning) procedure where that tool would
provide a similar modification of standards.
a. Applicability: The HRB shall have the authority
to authorize a variance of up to 35 percent from
any numerical standard set forth in Article 2 (Maps
and Districts) —except for Section 2.6, Height and
Section 2.7.4, Air Installation Compatibility Use
Zone (AICUZ) overlay district standards — and
Article 4 (Building Design and Infill Standards).
b. Review Criteria: The HRB may approve an
application for a Design Exception where it
reasonably determines that there will be no
significant negative impact upon residents of
surrounding property, or upon the general public.
The board shall consider the following criteria in its
review:
i. Compatibility: The proposed exception is
appropriate for its location. It is compatible
with the character of surrounding properties and the development permitted by the zoning of the
surrounding properties, and will not reduce property values of surrounding properties.
ii. No Adverse Impact: The design of the proposed exception minimizes adverse effects including
visual impacts of the proposed use on surrounding properties; furthermore, the proposed
exception does not create a nuisance for surrounding properties .
iii. Consistency with Adopted Plans: The proposed development is in general conformity with the
City’s Comprehensive Plan, Civic Master Plan and other plans officially adopted by the City
B. Guidance Standards, Maintenance of Consistent Policies: In order to provide guidance and insight into
desirable goals and objectives for the Beaufort Historic District, the documents described in this section are
hereby adopted for use by the HRB in the exercise of its authority granted under Section 10.7 of this Code.
1. The “Beaufort Preservation Manual,” August 1979, and the “Beaufort Preservation Manual, Supplement,”
August 1990, shall be utilized by the HRB for review of projects located within the Beaufort Preservation
Neighborhood.

2. The “Northwest Quadrant Design Principles,” May 1999 shall be utilized by the HRB for the review of
projects located within the Beaufort Conservation Neighborhood.
3. The Secretary of Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation” shall be utilized for review of all projects that
modify a contributing structure.
4. The Building Design Standards, in Article 4 of this code, shall be utilized for review of all new construction.
5. The Historic District Infill Design Guidelines, in Section 4.7 of this Code, shall be utilized for review of all
new construction.
6. Any special area policies adopted by the HRB
C. Approval of Certificate of Appropriateness: In reviewing an application, the HRB shall conduct a public
meeting and consider, among other things, the historic, architectural and aesthetic features of such structure,
the nature and character of the surrounding area, the use of such structure and its importance to the city,
the character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, texture, materials and color of
the structure in question, and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate
surroundings. The HRB shall not consider the interior arrangement or interior design unless the interior
arrangement or design affect the exterior appearance, nor shall it make requirements except for the purpose of
preventing developments that are not in harmony with the prevailing character of the Beaufort Historic District,
or that are obviously incongruous with this character.
D. Demolitions
1. In all applications involving the demolition of a contributing primary structure or contributing accessory
structure, provisions shall be made for a public hearing as set forth in Section 9.1.5. Demolition of noncontributing
structures are approved by the Administrator.
2. In any case involving the demolition or partial demolition of a structure, before granting approval or
requiring a postponement, the HRB may call on the Administrator to provide them with a report on the
state of repair and structural stability of the structure under consideration.
3. Upon receiving an application for demolition or partial demolition of a structure that is listed in the “1997
Beaufort County Historic Sites Survey” and lies within the limits of the city but outside the Beaufort
Historic District, the Administrator, within 30 days of receiving the application, shall either approve it,
or find that the preservation and protection of historic places and the public interest will be best served
by postponing the demolition for a designated period — this shall not exceed 60 days from the receipt
of the application, and notify the applicant of such postponement. The application will be announced to
the public in accordance with the notification standards set forth in Section 9.1.3. Within the period of
postponement of demolition or alteration of any building, the Administrator shall take steps to ascertain
what may be done to preserve the building, including consultation with private civic groups, interested
private citizens and other public boards or agencies, including investigation of the potential use of the
power of eminent domain when the preservation of a given building is clearly in the interest of the general
welfare of the community and of certain historic and architectural significance.
E. Denial of Certificate of Appropriateness: The HRB may refuse any application that, in the opinion of
the HRB, does not comply with the standards and guidelines listed in Section 9.10.2.B and thus would be
detrimental to the interests of the city. In case of disapproval, the HRB shall state the reasons therefore in a
written statement to the applicant, and may give verbal advice to the applicant and make recommendations in
regard to appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material, color, etc. of the property involved.
Among other grounds for considering a design inappropriate and requiring disapproval and resubmission are
the following defects:
1. Arresting and spectacular effects
2. Violent contrasts of materials or colors and intense or lurid colors

3. A multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance
4. The absence of unity and coherence in composition, that is not in consonance with the dignity and
character of the present structure, in the case of repair
5. Construction of, remodeling, or enlargement of an existing building in a manner not consistent with the
prevailing character of the neighborhood
F. Issuance of Certificate of Appropriateness: When a Certificate of Appropriateness and Building Permit
have been issued, the Administrator shall, from time to time, inspect the alteration or construction approved by
such certificate and may report such inspection to the HRB listing all work inspected and reporting any work
that is not in accordance with such certificate, or that violates any ordinances of the city.
G. Resubmittal: After disapproval of an application, the applicant may make modifications to the plans and
resubmit. The applicant may not resubmit the same proposal, without modifying it based on HRB comments,
for 12 months from the date of the original submission. Reconsideration of an application for demolition that
has been denied by the HRB may not be heard until 12 months from the date of the original public hearing,
unless a major change has occurred in the property condition that is attributable natural causes.
H. Appeal - Minor: Appeals of the decisions of the Administrator shall be heard by the HRB. The application for
appeal shall be made within 30 days of the decision.
I. Appeal - Major: Any party aggrieved by the decisions of the HRB may appeal to the circuit court within 30
days of the decision.

9.12: ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENT
9.12.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
A. Purpose: Administrative Adjustments are specified deviations from otherwise applicable development
standards where development is proposed that would be
1. compatible with surrounding land uses,
2. harmonious with the public interest,and
3. consistent with the purposes of this Code.
B. Adjustment of Numerical Standard: The Administrator shall have the authority to authorize modification
of up to 10% from any numerical standard set forth in Article 2 (Map & Districts) and Article 4 (Building
Design and Infill Standards) of this Code. Any request greater than 10% shall be treated as a variance handled by
the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBOA), and subject to the requirements of Section 9.14.
1. Specific to Landscaping and Tree Conservation: The following applies to landscaping and tree
conservation requirements in Article 5 (Landscaping, Parking & Lighting) with regard to the criteria in
Section 9.12.2.E:
a. In unusual cases, where there are few existing trees on a site and the planned development is small in
size relative to the size of the parcel, then the Administrator may adjust the tree planting requirements
(Section 5.3) downward in order not to require excessive planting out of proportion to the scale of the
development.
b. In the case of multi-phase developments on one parcel, the tree planting requirements (Section 5.3)
may be adjusted according to the size of each phase of the development.
c. Any particular planting requirement shall be proportionately reduced where existing plant materials are
of sufficient sizes and forms to satisfy the requirement.
C. Adjustment of Building Design Standards: Where an existing condition (e.g., utility easement, restrictive
covenant, tree or natural feature) prohibits strict compliance with the building design standards in Article 4, the
Administrator may waive or adjust the standard as appropriate to assure compliance to the
extent practical. This adjustment shall be as small possible in order to accommodate the
existing conditions.
D. Permission of Flag Lot: Where conditions set forth in Section 2.5.5.C are met, the
Administrator may permit a flag lot. When a flag lot is proposed in conjunction with a
Major Subdivision, it shall be incorporated into the process laid out in Section 9.9.3.

1. Granting the Administrative Adjustment will ensure the same general level of land use compatibility as the
otherwise applicable standards.
2. Granting the Administrative Adjustment will not materially and adversely affect adjacent land uses and the
physical character of uses in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development because of inadequate
buffering, screening, setbacks, and other land use considerations.
3. Granting the Administrative Adjustment will not adversely affect property values in any material way.
4. Granting the Administrative Adjustment will be generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this
Code.

permit application consistent with this Code.
F. Special Exception Review Criteria: The ZBOA may approve an application for a Special Exception where it
reasonably determines that there will be no significant negative impact upon residents of surrounding property
or upon the general public. The ZBOA shall consider the following criteria in its review:
1. The proposed uses compatibility with existing land uses in the surrounding area
2. The harmony of the proposed site plan, circulation plan, and schematic architectural designs with the
character of the surrounding area
3. The likely impact on public infrastructure — such as roads, parking facilities, and water and sewer systems
—and on public services — such as police and fire protection and solid waste collection— and the ability
of existing infrastructure and services to adequately service the proposed use without negatively impacting
existing uses in the area and in the City (a traffic impact analysis shall be required per Section 7.3.2.)
4. The general conformity of the proposed use and designs with the city’s Civic Master Plan, Comprehensive
Plan, and any other plans officially adopted by the City;
5. The likely impact on public health and safety
6. The potential creation of noise, lights, fumes, dust, smoke, vibration, fire hazard, or other injurious or
obnoxious impacts

1. After review of the variance application and the public hearing, the ZBOA shall approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the application
2. If approval or approval with conditions is granted,
the decision shall be communicated in writing to
the applicant within 15 days, and the applicant
shall be authorized to submit a development permit
application.
F. Criteria for Approval of Variances
1. Required Findings: A variance may be granted by
the ZBOA if it concludes that the strict enforcement
of any design and performance standard set forth in
this Code would result in unnecessary hardship to the
applicant, and that by granting the variance, the spirit
of this Code will be observed, public welfare and safety
will not be diminished, and substantial justice will be
done. A variance may be granted in an individual case
of unnecessary hardship only when the ZBOA makes,
and explains in writing, all of the following findings:
a. There are extraordinary and exceptional
conditions pertaining to the particular piece of
property. For example, the variance is justified
because of topographic or other special conditions
unique to the property and development involved,
in contradistinction to the mere inconvenience or
financial disadvantage.
b. These conditions do not generally apply to other
property in the vicinity.
c. The conditions are not the result of the applicant’s
own actions.
d. Granting of the variance would not substantially
conflict with the Comprehensive Plan, the Civic Master Plan and the purposes and intent of this Code.
e. Because of these conditions, the application of this Code to the particular piece of property would
effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property.
f. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or the public
good, and the character of the zone will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
2. Limitations: The ZBOA may not grant a variance if it would do any of the following:
a. Allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in the applicable district
b. Increase the density of a use above which is permitted in the applicable district
c. Physically extend a nonconforming use of land
d. Change the zone boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map
3. Profitability Not to Be Considered: Profitability shall not be considered grounds for a variance.
4. Conditions: In granting a variance, the ZBOA may attach to it conditions regarding the location, character,
or other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as the ZBOA considers advisable to protect
established property values in the surrounding area, or to promote public health, safety, or general welfare.

11.2: GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES
11.2.1 MODIFICATIONS TO NONCONFORMITIES
A. Applicability: The Administrator (Section 10.5) shall hear and decide changes of use from
any landowner to
1. make a change in use of a nonconforming use to a different, less-intense nonconforming use.
2. make a change in location of a nonconforming use of land to another location on the
same property.
3. allow the replacement of a structure with a nonconforming use.
B. Criteria for Approval: The Administrator may only grant a change for a nonconforming use
or replacement of a nonconforming structure that has been destroyed after determining that
1. the proposed change will be more suitable and appropriate for the lot(s) on which it is
located than the existing situation is.
2. the proposed change will have a less harmful effect than the existing situation on the
properties surrounding the lot(s) in question.
3. the decision to grant the change will be consistent with the general purpose and intent of
this Code, and will not adversely effect the neighborhood or otherwise be detrimental to
the public welfare.
C. Conditions of Approval: The Administrator, in granting such changes, may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms upon which the change was
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Code, and shall be subject to enforcement
provisions as prescribed per Article 12 (Violations and Enforcement).
11.3: NONCONFORMING USES
11.3.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICABILITY
A nonconforming use is a use of land, buildings, or structures that was lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this Code, or a subsequent amendment thereto, but does not conform to
the use regulations of Article 3 (Land Use Provisions) for the district in which it is located. This
definition includes open uses of land (e.g., storage yards and parking lots), as well as the structures
that contain nonconforming uses. The nonconformity may result from the adoption of this Code
or any subsequent amendment.
11.3.2 CONTINUATION OF EXISTING USE
A. Any use existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter which does not conform with
the provisions of this Code for the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a
nonconforming use and is subject to the standards of this Article. Once a nonconforming
use is discontinued as per Section 11.3.4, it may not later be reestablished or converted to any
other nonconforming use.
B. When mobile home parks are located in districts other than the Mobile Home Park (MHP)
District, the park may remain active, with units being brought in and replacing older units.
However, the density shall not exceed the originally approved density without the property
being rezoned to MHP.

11.3.3 EXPANSION OF USE
A nonconforming use of land or building shall not be enlarged, intensified, or expanded except
as follows: A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Code,
but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
11.3.4 ABANDONMENT / DISCONTINUANCE
A nonconforming use of a building or premises which has been discontinued shall not thereafter
be returned to the same or any other that use.
A. Determination of Discontinuance: A nonconforming use shall be deemed discontinued
when any of the following has occurred within a continuous period of 180 days:
1. The owner has, in writing or by public statement, indicated intent to abandon the use.
2. A conforming use has replaced the preceding nonconforming use.
3. All of the buildings or structures on the subject property housing the nonconforming use
have been removed.
4. Any basic utilities including water, electric and sewer service are disconnected by the
utility provider.
5. Business license has not been renewed.
6. The property, structure or use has been vacant or inactive
a. This may be implied from acts — or the failure to act — including, but not limited
to the removal of and failure to replace the characteristic equipment and furnishings,
lack of utility consumption necessary to maintain the use at an operable level,
documented vacancy, or other circumstances.
b. If operations have ceased for more than 180 consecutive days, the presence of
characteristic equipment and furnishings is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish
the continuity/operation of the use.
c. The mere vacancy of a structure for a period exceeding 180 consecutive days that was
initially constructed as a single-family dwelling and whose most recent use was as a
single-family dwelling shall not constitute a discontinuance of the use.
11.3.5 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION
When a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, flood,
explosions, wind, earthquake, war, riot or other act, to the extent of more than 100% of the
property’s Fair Market Value — as shown on the county tax records — at the time of such damage,
such a building, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses.
11.4: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
11.4.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICABILITY
A nonconforming structure is a physical feature or characteristic of a use, building, structure, or
other development of land that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Code, but
does not conform to dimensional, design, locational, or other requirements of this Code.

11.4.2 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING STRUCTURE
Any building existing at the time of the enactment of this Code that does not conform with
the provisions of this Code for the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a
nonconforming structure and is subject to the standards of this article.
A. Repairs, Alterations, and Maintenance: Any nonconforming building or structure that is
renovated, repaired, altered, or otherwise improved by more than100% of the Fair Market
Value of the structure at the time of renovation, repair, or alteration shall be brought into
conformance with landscaping, screening, sign, lighting, access, and parking requirements.
1. In transect zones, the building must also be brought into compliance with setback,
frontage, and architectural standards of this Code. If full compliance can not be achieved
due to the scope of work (e.g., mostly interior) the building must be brought into
compliance as much as possible.
2. In conventional zones, architectural design changes required to bring the site into
conformity with the requirements of this Code shall be in proportion to the alterations
proposed by the applicant.
B. Damage or Destruction
1. When a nonconforming building or structure damaged by fire, flood, explosions, wind,
earthquake, war, riot or other act, to the extent of more than 75% of the Fair Market
Value of the structure — as shown on the county tax records — at the time of such
damage, such a building, if restored, shall conform to the requirements of this Code.
C. Applicability: The provisions of this section shall not apply to any detached single-family
dwelling used for residential purposes. In the case of a significant calamity, such properties
may be repaired or rebuilt, regardless of the cost in relationship to the Fair Market Value of the
structure, within the original (pre-disaster) building footprint.
11.4.3 EXPANSION OF STRUCTURE
A nonconforming structure shall not be expanded in any way, except in conformity with this
Code, except in cases where the primary building on a lot is nonconforming solely as a result of a
setback encroachment, additions to the structure can be allowed, provided the new addition does
not project into the setback. If a proposed addition would encroach into the same setback that
already had been encroached upon, the addition can be allowed, provided it projects no further
into the setback than the existing structure.

11.4.4 RECONSTRUCTION
A nonconforming structure shall not be demolished and rebuilt as a nonconforming structure,
A. Exceptions: A nonconforming structure listed as contributing in the “Beaufort County
Above Ground Historic Resources Survey Beaufort County, South Carolina” may be allowed
to be rebuilt within the original (pre-demolition) footprint.
11.5: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
11.5.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICABILITY
A nonconforming lot is a lot that was lawfully created prior to the effective date of this Code, but
that does not meet the dimensional requirements of Article 2 (Map & Districts) for the district in
which it is located.
11.5.2 STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT
A. Any existing platted lot, described above, is buildable.
B. When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other
respects, but the applicable setback requirements set forth in Article 2 cannot practicably be
complied with, then the Administrator may allow deviations from the setback requirements if
(s)he finds that
1. the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such
deviations.
2. these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot.
3. the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on
surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
C. For purposes of this section, compliance with applicable building setback requirements
is not reasonably possible if a building serving the minimal needs of the proposed use
cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback
requirements; however, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that
compliance is not reasonably possible.
11.6: NONCONFORMING SIGN
11.6.1 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
A. Determination of Nonconformity: Any sign that does not meet the standards of this Code
will be considered a legal nonconforming sign, provided that it received a permit prior to the
adoption of this Code.
B. Loss of Legal Nonconforming Status: A legal nonconforming sign shall lose this designation if:
1. the sign is relocated or replaced.
2. the structure, design, or size of the sign is altered in any way. This does not refer to normal
maintenance or lettering changes on changeable copy signs.
3. a tenant vacates a building, in which case all existing signs shall be removed within 30 days.
C. Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Signs: An existing nonconforming sign
cannot be modified in any way except for routine maintenance (e.g., rot repair, painting,
fading, electrical) without bringing the sign into conformity with this section subject to
the requirements of Section 11.6.1.D.1 and 11.6.1.D.2. Routine maintenance will include

replacement of individual’s names listed on signs. It will not include rebranding or changing
business name or logo.
D. Mandatory Compliance: All signs must comply with the standards of this Code with the
following provisions:

compliance with this Code before a business license will be issued for a new resident
business, or before a business name can be changed.
2. Temporary nonconforming signs that obtained a sign permit before the adoption date of
this Code shall be permitted to remain for the life of the permit.
3. Nonconforming monuments, supports and brackets, and unused signs must be
completely removed before a new sign is installed. Any holes in the building must be
appropriately patched.
4. Nonconforming multi-tenant signs may continue to update individual business plaques;
however, the size and design of the monument structure may not change without
bringing the sign into compliance with this Code.
11.7: OTHER NONCONFORMITIES
11.7.1 PARKING NONCONFORMITIES
Specific to Conventional Zones Only: In cases of nonconformance due to insufficient
automobile parking, buildings may not be enlarged or expanded until/unless parking
accommodations satisfy the requirements for the new construction as described in Section 5.7
(Parking). The Administrator may waive or provide relief from this requirement if it is determined
that doing so will have no material adverse impact on the property or surrounding community.
Parcels located in Transect Zones are not subject to this requirement.
11.7.2 LANDSCAPING NONCONFORMITIES
When modifications are made to developed nonconforming property, a certain percentage of the
value of those modifications shall be expended toward landscaping on the overall site in order to
incrementally bring the site closer to compliance as follows:
A. When improvements to existing buildings or sites exceed $25,000 in value, 5% of the value
of these improvements shall be expended towards bringing the site and landscaping into
compliance with this Code.
1. These improvements include additions to existing buildings, interior or exterior building
renovations or improvement, addition of communications towers and antennae , and/
or modifications made to the ground other than to structures, such as grading, paving,
repaving, or re-striping of parking lots.
2. These improvements do not include signage or landscaping, or routine maintenance items
such as mechanical system updates, rot repair, painting, etc.
B. Upon construction of new freestanding buildings, whether in greenfield or infill/
redevelopment situations, all landscaping requirements for that zoning district shall apply (see
Sections 5.5 and 5.6).
C. The Administrator shall review and approve the proposed landscaping plan to assure
optimal effectiveness in bringing the site closer to compliance. The priority for installation of
landscaping is as follows:
1. Creating or completing the streetscape based on the street regulating plan in Appendix C

2. Perimeter screening of parking areas
3. Planting of overstory trees in the interior of parking areas — the work may include
removing portions of pavement in order to install landscaping peninsulas, perimeter
buffers, and other landscaping areas. Where the overall circulation and parking pattern
will be disrupted, the developer shall not be required to remove paving.
D. Once the property is brought into compliance to the extent practicable, no further
landscaping expenditures shall be required.
E. Where parking spaces are removed in order to provide landscaping as required in this section,
the required number of parking spaces specified in Section 5.7 shall be automatically reduced
accordingly, but it may not go below 67% of the requirements in that section without a
variance.
11.7.3 LIGHTING NONCONFORMITIES
Any lighting that does not meet the standards set out in Section 5.8 and trespasses onto a
neighboring property must be brought into compliance within 3 months of the date of adoption
of this Code.
11.8: RELIEF
11.8.1 APPEALS
Appeals of the decision of the Administrator may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals as
stated out in Section 9.15.2.

Where timeframes for action are given in this Section, property owners may be granted up to two
extensions of the given timeframe. Extensions requests be received in writing a minimum of one
week prior to the time expiration.
Example: a non-conforming use is considered abandoned if it has been inactive for 180 days. The
property owner may request up to two 180-day extensions to restart this non-conforming use.

A.1: CERTIFIED ARBORIST REPORT
A.1.1 REQUIREMENTS
A Certified Arborist report is a document which provides visual
assessment information based on a Level 2, Basic Tree Risk
Assessment following the standards outlined in ANSI A300 – Part
9: Tree, Shrub and Other Woody Plant Management – Standard
Practices. The report shall include:
A. An outline of the individual health and condition of required
tree(s) to be removed or saved;
B. Root flare measurement for all specimen and landmark trees.
C. Recommendations regarding performance and timing of
pre-disturbance maintenance procedures using arboricultural
practices for the promotion of individual tree health as required
(eg. crown pruning, root pruning and root fertilization) for all
trees to be preserved; and
D. Recommendations for follow-up procedures such as root
invigoration and/or fertilization at conclusion of construction
phase to be listed.
E. Any special conditions required where development is required
to encroach into a tree protection zone (eg. special curbing,
pervious paving, tree wells).
A.1.2 FORMAT
The report format for specimen and landmark trees that are
requested for removal should be placed into four categories based on
structural and physical health factors, with each category highlighted
with a specific color on the site plan:
Category A: Slight defects with a low risk of failure – Green
Category B: Moderate defects with a reasonable risk of failure –
Yellow
Category C: Severe defects with a high risk of failure – Orange
Category D: Critical defects with an imminent risk of failure – Red

B.2: SPECIFIC TO THE BLADEN STREET REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
B.2.1 HISTORY AND PURPOSE
In 2001, the city created a master plan for the Bladen Street Redevelopment District through a design charrette
process involving the community and a team of design professionals. Thee regulations are form-based and
reflect the existing character of Beaufort and the surrounding region. The code enables a mixed-use physical
environment to further enhance the economic and cultural success of Bladen Street and contiguous areas.
Traditional urban design conventions have been applied to set design parameters for how buildings and other
elements relate to those streets. Applications for development in the Bladen Street Redevelopment District
do not have to comply with the design specifics of the recommended texts as listed in Appendix D.1; the texts
are for reference and guidance only and are not to be seen as regulatory. Where approvals, interpretations,
and judgments are subject to reasonable application by city officials, these officials should use this section for
guidance as to best practices.
B.2.2 BLADEN STREET IMPORTANCE
The street serves as a central roadway in the regional transportation network, extending downtown Beaufort.
While serving the important function of moving motor vehicles in and out of town, Bladen Street is also multimodal
and is envisioned as a pedestrian friendly street. Buildings along the street should be mixed-use and have
doors and windows facing the street.
B.2.3 MASTER PLAN
The Bladen Street master plan was created during a community design charrette that took place in 2001 and
involved input from major stakeholders, consultants, city staff, and the general public. A $1.2 million public
investment into streetscape improvements was completed in 2013. The plan synthesizes community ideas and
depicts the idealized build-out for the Bladen Street Redevelopment District. The Bladen Street master plan
identifies key opportunity parcels for potential development, redevelopment, parking locations, and preservation.

B.3: SPECIFIC TO THE BOUNDARY STREET REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
B.3.1 HISTORY AND PURPOSE
In September 2005, the city created a master plan for the Boundary Street Redevelopment District through
a design charrette process involving the community and a team of design professionals. These regulations
are form-based and reflect the existing character of Beaufort and the surrounding region. The code enables
a mixed-use physical environment to further enhance the economic and cultural success of Boundary Street
and contiguous areas. Traditional urban design conventions have been applied to create a palette of street
types that form the framework for the Boundary Street Redevelopment District by setting design parameters
for how buildings and other elements relate to those streets. These street standards are found in Appendix C.
Applications for development in the Boundary Street Redevelopment District do not have to comply with the
design specifics of the recommended texts as listed in Appendix D.1; the texts are for reference and guidance
only and are not to be seen as regulatory. Where approvals, interpretations, and judgments are subject to
reasonable application by city officials, these officials shall use the applicable sections for guidance as to best
practices.
B.3.2 MASTER PLAN
The Boundary Street master plan was created during a community design charrette which took place
September 23-29, 2005 and involved input from major stakeholders, consultants, city staff, and the general
public. The plan synthesizes community ideas and depicts the idealized build-out for the Boundary Street
Redevelopment District. The Boundary Street master plan identifies key opportunity parcels for potential
development, redevelopment, parking locations, and preservation. A large version of the Boundary Street
master plan is available at the Department of Planning and Development Services. The illustrative master
plan in this section, and the Street Sections in Appendix C, shall serve as guidance to the city architect with
respect to the city’s intent for land development in the Boundary Street Redevelopment District. The illustrative
master plan is meant to demonstrate the character intended for the Redevelopment District, but is for
illustrative purposes only. The accompanying text and numbers are rules that govern permitted development.

C.1: GENERAL
The primary goal of the Street Infrastructure Plans is to create a connected street
network which offers safe and convenient access for all users (pedestrians, bicyclists,
drivers and transit riders) of all ages and abilities.
The following pages outline street standards that promote a complete street system
by tailoring street design to its intended users and development context. This is
done via the following diagrams:
C.1.1 OFFICIAL STREET NETWORK PLAN - EXISTING, ADOPTED AND PROPOSED
The Official Street Network Plan, divided into different segments of the
city, depicts the existing street network in the city, proposed streets that
have been adopted as part of an existing Official Map [hereby referred
to as “new adopted streets”], and new streets that are proposed as part
of the Civic Master Plan process. New proposed streets that are not
part of an existing Official Map, as indicated in blue on the diagrams,
are non-binding and for recommendation only. See Section 7.2.1.B for
establishment and implementation details.
C.1.2 STREET HIERARCHY DIAGRAM
This diagram, showing both existing streets and new adopted streets, indicates
the most significant streets and intersections in the city. The code refers to
Primary and Secondary streets and Significant Intersections particularly in the
District Standards (Article 2), Land Use Provisions (Article 3) and Building
Design Standards (Article 4). For further definitions and applicability of
Primary Streets, see the definition in Article 13.
C.1.3 STREET REGULATING PLAN
This diagram, showing both existing streets and new adopted streets,
indicates the prescribed street section for each street, based on existing
conditions, future development potential and existing right-of-way
dimension. New proposed streets that are not part of an existing Official
Map are indicated on the second page of the diagrams for each area of the
city. These are included as a guide for how development could potentially
occur; they are non-binding and for recommendation only. See Section
7.2.1 for information on applicability and implementation.
C.1.4 TYPICAL STREET SECTIONS
Beaufort has a number of typical street designs that capture the unique
vernacular of of the area. The Street Regulating Plan applies specific
expectations for streetscape characteristics to every street segment in
the city. Each street type identified on the Street Regulating Plan maps
corresponds to a street section diagram on the following pages that
establishes the specific standards for that street.

C.1.5 SPECIFIC STREET SECTIONS
In certain instances, portions of streets have been marked as “Other” on the Street Regulating Plan diagrams. These
street segments have been specifically designed with details that deviate from the typical street sections to respond
to the context: specific environmental, neighborhood, or development opportunities. Each of these specific street
sections are included in this chapter following the typical street sections that apply to most streets throughout
Beaufort.
In some cases, a specific street section may apply only to a portion of a single street. In other cases, a specific street section
may apply to multiple streets. The applicability of each specific street section is detailed in a corresponding table.
A. Military Roads
Some streets have been identified as “Military Roads” in the Street Infrastructure Plan. These streets have been
left to the discretion of their associated military authority.
B. Overhead Utilities
It is the intention of this plan to continue the city’s pursuit of the burying of overhead utilities as a part of each
street improvement project where funding permits. Where lines cannot be buried, the city will continue to work
with the utility providers to replace or eliminate dead lines, unused equipment, and aging poles to improve the
overall aesthetics of the entire city.
C.1.6 TREE PLANTING STANDARDS
The following standards shall be used in conjunction with the appropriate street section.
A. Minimum Quantities: Street trees shall be installed according to the the street sections in C.4 and C.5.
B. Minimum Spacing: Arrangement of and distance between hardwood trees should correspond to the expected
mature spread of the trees and shall in no instance be less than
1. 40 feet between overstory trees
2. 25 feet between overstory trees and understory trees
3. 15 feet between understory trees and palms
C. Conflict with Street Lighting: Street trees shall be located and planted so as not to diminish the effectiveness
of required street lighting, and in no instance shall street lights be located closer than
1. 15 feet to overstory trees
2. 8 feet to understory trees
D. Tree Wells
1. In commercial areas where there is no planting strip, trees shall be provided with grates, hard surface tree
wells, or other approved methods of root protection.
2. Tree wells for overstory trees shall be as specified per street section. The ideal tree well size is 5 feet by 10
feet ; however tree wells may be reduced to 5 feet by 5 feet if structural soils or silva cells are provided. Root
barrier fabric is required.
3. Tree wells for understory or palm trees shall be a minimum of 5 feet by 5 feet.

C.5.6 Parkway
(PW: 52 ft - 68ft)
Description
Parkways are intended to be fronted on at least one side by a park,
square, plaza, river or marsh. If such park/natural spaces front only
one side of the street, Parkways are suitable to support a broad range
of development types on the opposite side, including residential,
commercial, mixed-use and civic buildings. Parkways accommodate
pedestrians and bicyclists through a multi-use path located on any
one side of the street which is fronted by a park/natural space. Where
right-of-way is sufficient, Parkways provide parallel parking on both
sides of the street. If the right-of-way is constrained, parallel parking
is required on one side of the street only, preferably on the side of
the street with fronting development. A sidewalk/multi-use path may
not be required on the park side.

C.5.8 Neighborhood St. 2 - Yield
(NS2: 40 ft - 50 ft)
Description
Type 2 Neighborhood Streets are primarily intended to serve singlefamily
structures in residential neighborhoods. The traveled way for
cars is slightly narrower than a Type 1 Neighborhood Street, calming
traffic and allowing for a yield flow of cars between vehicles parked
on the street.

C.5.7 Neighborhood St. 1 - General
(NS1: 50 ft - 62 ft)
Description
Type 1 Neighborhood Streets are the most common urban street
type in Beaufort. These versatile streets are typically unmarked in
residential neighborhoods to allow for informal parking, but can be
striped with bike lanes and/or a lane of on-street parking as necessary
in more urban situations. As Beaufort’s neighborhoods begin to fill
in and intensify over time, this street type with its formal curbs and
sidewalks may be applied as the logical next step in urbanization
from Low Impact Development roads with their open swale drainage.
Curb Type Curb
Right-of-Way Width 50 to 62 feet

C.5.9 Neighborhood St. 3 - Lane
(NS3: 38 ft - 46 ft)
Description
Type 3 Neighborhood Streets are small residential lanes intended to
provide direct access to the front of a limited number of single-family
structures. This street type should be used in situations where the
right-of-way is too constrained for other typical street types, and
is ideally paired with a Rear Lane that provides off-street parking
access to the rear of lots.

Specific Applicability See Street Regulating Plan
C.5.10 Low Impact Development Rd.
(LID: 38 ft +)
Description
In areas where a formal curb and sidewalk treatment is not needed
to support adjacent development, this street type provides adequate
infrastructure while allowing for the passive infiltration of stormwater at
the street edge. In addition to providing drainage, the planting strip area
may be reinforced to allow for on-street “parkway parking” between
required street trees. Sidewalks should be provided as necessary
where the right-of-way is wide enough to accommodate them.

Street Regulating Plan - Other Streets with Specific Street Sections
All of the street segments marked as “Other” in the Street Regulating Plan (illustrated in the map above) have been
assigned one of the specific street sections on the following pages. These street sections were carefully designed during
the Civic Master Plan process to address unique site-specific considerations. As such, these street sections are specifically
tailored to a unique development context and deviate from the standards enumerated in the typical street sections. In some
cases, a specific street section may apply only to a portion of a single street. In other cases, a specific street section may apply
to multiple streets. The applicability of each specific street section is enumerated in its corresponding table.
