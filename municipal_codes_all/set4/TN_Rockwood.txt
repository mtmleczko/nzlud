stands, patios, structures, and all site improvements, shall be harmoniously
and efficiently organized in relation to the topography, the shape, size, and
42
,.......
position of structures and common facilities. Full attention shall be paid to
use, appearance and livability.
(b) Protection from adverse influences. Adequate protection shall be provided
against undesirable on;.site and off"'site views or any adverse influence (such
as heavy commercial or industrial use, heavy traffic, or brightly lighted
activities, dumpsters, etc:).
(c) Design. The site plan shall provide for a desirable residential environment
for mobile homes, which is an asset to the community in which it is located.
Innovation and imaginative design shall be encouraged, monotony avoided.
(d) Pads. The mobile home stand (pad) shall provide for practical placement on
and removal from the lot and retention of the home in a stable condition and
in satisfactory relationship to its surroundings. Its size shall accommodate
the dimensions of the mobile homes anticipated and the location shall be at
such elevation, distance, and angle in relation to the access street and the
mobile home accessway that placement and removal is practical.
(e) Pad grades. Appropriate material, properly graded, placed and compacted
so as to be durable and adequate for the support of the maximum anticipated
loads during all seasons shall be used. There shall be a longitudinal gradient
of 0% to 5% and an adequate crown or cross gradient for surface drainage.
(f) Open space depth. Open space depth is the clear open space that lies in any
direction away from a mobile home stand at any point on the mobile home
stand. It is measured on a line which is perpendicular (at right angles) to the
stand line. This depth shall equal, at any point measured, no less than 4 feet
plus 10% of the length of the stand. For purposes of design, the cutline of
the actual mobile home proposed and the outline of the mobile home stand
are considered the same.
(g) Distance between mobile homes. The distance between mobile homes or
mobile home stands shall not be less that the sum of the open space depth
figured for each opposing mobile home stand. If structural additions to a
mobile home are anticipated in the planning program, design distances
between mobile homes must be computed on the assumption that the
addition is already a part of the mobile home.
(h) Alternate open space depth. Once a minimum lot width has been established
applying determination of distances as described in paragraph (g) above, a
limited number of stands in any one park may incorporate an alternate total
open space depth between two mobile homes of six (6) feet. In such
instances, the two mobile homes must be placed on their respective lots in
such a way as to maximize the open space available on the patio or outdoor
living area side of the mobile homes in question. Increased site livability is
43
.
the only objective for the application of this exception and in no case will
the clustering of two mobile homes near a common lot line result in a
reduction in lot size.
(i) Distance across streets. The distance from the line or comer side of the
mobile home stand to any stand on the opposite side of a street shall be 36
feet minimum.
G) Distance to common areas. The distance from the line or comer of the
mobile home stand to a street pavement, a common parking area, a common
walk or other common area shall be eight (8) feet minimum.
(k) Site buffers. The distance from the line or comer of any mobile home stand
to a boundary line of the development shall be adequate to protect the
residential use in the development and in any case shall not be less than 15
feet. The outer boundary of the site shall be buffered; preferably with live
planting or neatly maintained natural vegetation.
(1) Lot lines. The limits of each mobile home lot shall be clearly marked on the
ground by permanent flush stakes, markers or other suitable means.

(3) Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas .· with Established Base Flood
Elevations and With Floodways Designated
(4)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 14-703,
Subsection (2), are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion
potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow
for the discharge Qf the base flood without increased flood heights and velocities.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development within the
regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it
is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices that the cumulative effect
of the proposed encroachments or new development shall not result in any
increase in tht: water surface elevation of the Base Flood Elevation,
velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of a base flood
discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the
same methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City
of Rockwood, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Section 14-705, Sections (1) and (2).

Subsection (2), where streams exist with base flood data provided but where no
floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and substantial
improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1)
foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification
72
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic
engineering principles.
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where
permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of Section 14-705, Sections (1) and (2).
(5) Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and
Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 14-703,
Subsection (2), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and
where a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall ~pply:
(a) The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base
Flood Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or
other sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations (see
2 below), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development in approximate A Zones meet the
requirements of Section 14-705, Subsections (1) and (2).
(b) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and
subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include

established and where such data is not available from other sources, require
the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at
least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Section
14-702). All . applicable data including elevations or floodproofing
certifications shall be recorded as set forth in Section 14-704, Subsection
(2). Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of Section 14-705, Subsection (2).
(d) Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within
an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet (20), whichever is
greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within
the City of Rockwood, Tennessee. The engineering certification should be
supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.

Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 14-703,
Subsection (2), are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to
those set forth in Section 14-705, Subsections (1) and (2), apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential
buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to at lea8t one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number
specified on the FIR.M's, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no
flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including
(b)
·. basement, shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above the highest
adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to faCilitate automatic equalization of
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance
with standards of 14-705, Subsection (2). ·
All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and
designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot
above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three
(3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods
of construction are in acoordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide such certification
to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in accordance with

Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 14-703,
Subsection (2), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Sections 14-704 and 14-705 shall apply.
74
(8) Standards for Unmapped Streams
Located within the City of Rockwood, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where
areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated ne>r identified. Adjacent to such
streams, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) No encroachments including fill material or other development including
structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width
of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1)
foot at any point within the locality.
(b) When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and floodway
data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet
