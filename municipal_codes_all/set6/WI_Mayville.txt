Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.

§ 355-27. Basis for sewer service charges.
Sewer users served by Water Utility water meters. There is hereby levied and assessed uponeach lot, parcel of land, building or premises having a connection with the wastewater system andbeing served with water solely by the Water Utility a wastewater treatment service charge based,in part, on the quantity of water used, as measured by the Water Utility water meter used upon thepremises.
Sewer users served by private wells.
If any person discharging sewage into the public sanitary sewer system procures any part orall of his water from sources other than the Water Utility, all or part of which is discharged intothe public sanitary sewer system, the person shall be required to have water meters installedfor the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these sources. Wheresewer meters are already installed, water meters will not be required. The water meters shallbe furnished by the Water Utility and installed under its supervision, all costs being at theexpense of the person requiring the meter.
The user shall be responsible for the purchase of a water meter that meets the specificationsof the Water Utility. The Utility will maintain, repair and test the meter. Costs attributable to themeter maintenance, repair and testing will be assessed to the user.
Noncontact meters.
If a user feels that a significant amount of metered water does not reach the sanitary sewer,he can, at his own expense, through the approving authority, install a second water meter oran additional metered service that would monitor this flow. Charges for sewer use would bemade based on the difference between the two meter readings if only a second meter isinstalled and on actual water metered for sewer use if an additional metered service isinstalled.
Requests for a second meter or metered service must be made in writing to the approvingauthority.
The approving authority may make exceptions to the requirements of noncontact meters forresidential users if the amount of City water used and not discharged to the sanitary sewercan be estimated by the approving authority.

Editor's Note: This chapter was adopted as Ch. 300, but was renumbered to fit into the organizationalstructure of the Code.
§ 357-1. Findings and intent.
Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders whoprey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexualoffenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and mostsexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and areprosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimizationto society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is the intent of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the City'scompelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizensof the City by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentratednumbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishingtemporary or permanent residence.
§ 357-2. Definitions.

The flood-fringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits andthe floodway.
The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered byfloodwater during the regional flood.
§ 410-8. Locating floodplain boundaries.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditionsshall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection A or B below. If a significant difference exists, themap shall be amended according to Article
VIII
. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundaryderived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment isrequired. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment fieldconditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any mapamendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicantover the district boundary line shall be settled according to §

§ 420-1. Statutory authorization.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 281.31, Wis.Stats.
§ 420-2. Finding of fact and purpose.
Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipalitywould adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the taxbase. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands;
Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments,nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands andother aquatic habitat;
Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover andcontrolling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities.
§ 420-3. Compliance required.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shallbe in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federalregulations. (However, see §
420-12
of this chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforminguses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwiseexpressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
§ 420-4. Municipalities and state agencies regulated.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to complywith this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if§ 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of statehighways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when § 30.2022,Wis. Stats., applies.
§ 420-5. Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under§ 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except thatwhere another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinanceshall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenantsor easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of thischapter shall prevail.
§ 420-6. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimumrequirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed alimitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of thischapter is required by a standard in Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the provision of thischapter is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Ch. NR 117 standards in effect onthe date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment tothis chapter.
§ 420-7. Annexed areas.
The county shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect and shallbe administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982, unlessany of the changes as allowed by § 59.692(7)(a)1 to 3, Wis.

The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which are five acresor more and are shown on the Final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made apart of this chapter and which are:
Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages.Lakes, ponds or flowages in the municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they areshown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base mapswhich have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter.
Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to thelandward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall bepresumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittentwaterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning basemaps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplainzoning maps adopted in §
420-8
shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas.
Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by theZoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact theappropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinaryhigh-water mark.
When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown onthe official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the ZoningAdministrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if theshoreland-wetland district boundary, as mapped, is in error. If Department staff concur with theZoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the ZoningAdministrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordancewith the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mappingerrors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in Subsections
D
and
E
, the ZoningAdministrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.
Filled wetlands. Wetlands which are filled prior to the date on which the municipality received finalwetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent thatthe area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this chapter.
Wetlands landward of a bulkhead line. Wetlands located between the original ordinary high-watermark and a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982, under § 30.11, Wis. Stats., are notsubject to this chapter.

Collector streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of trafficfrom residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system andshall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators, such asschools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population, and to the majorstreets to which they connect.
Minor streets. Minor streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use bythrough traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems and torequire the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abuttingproperty.
Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract beingsubdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinionof the Council, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout ofthe subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts.
Major street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacentto a major street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access andseparation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage with screen plantingor an earth berm contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear or side property line, or bythe use of frontage streets.

Minor streets shall not necessarily continue across major or collector streets, but if the center linesof such local streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within 300 feet of each other,measured along the center line of the major or collector street, then the location shall be soadjusted that the adjoinment across the major or collector street is continuous and a jog isavoided.
§ 425-49. Blocks.
The widths, lengths and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, zoningrequirements, need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the limitations andopportunities of topography. In addition:
The length of blocks in residential areas shall not, as a general rule, be less than 400 feet normore than 1,200 feet in length unless otherwise dictated by exceptional topography or otherlimiting factors of good design.
Pedestrianways are generally not desired and should be avoided; however, pedestrianways of notless than 10 feet in width may be required near the center and entirely across any block over 900feet in length where deemed essential by the Plan Commission to provide adequate pedestriancirculation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities.

]
The Planned Unit Development Overlay District (hereinafter referred to as "PUD") is established toprovide a voluntary regulatory framework designed to encourage and promote improved environmentaland aesthetic design in the City by allowing for greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in thedevelopment of land while ensuring substantial compliance to the basic intent of this chapter and theComprehensive Plan for community development. A PUD provides for the superimposing of anapproved plan for development on property already designated as a basic zoning district identified inthis chapter. PUD districts are approved specifically for the development being proposed. If thedevelopment is not implemented within 24 months of approval of the specific implementation plan, theproperty shall revert to its original zoning. The amount of implementation progress required to preventreversion to the original zoning shall be included as part of the specific implementation plan approval.Some specific purposes of developments in the PUD are:
Residential planned developments. To offer recreational opportunities close to home, to enhancethe appearance of neighborhoods by conservation of streams and local spots of natural beauty, toadd to the sense of spaciousness through the preservation of natural spaces, to counteract theeffects or urban monotony and congestion in the streets, to encourage cooperative relationshipsbetween neighbors and participation by all age groups in the use and care of local open spacetracts in new residential subdivisions, to promote harmonious architecture between adjacentdwellings or institutional buildings, and to encourage the placement of structures in properrelationship to the natural characteristics of the site.
Business or commercial planned development. To promote the cooperative development ofbusiness or commercial centers each with adequate off-street parking, to control access points onthoroughfares, to separate pedestrians and automobile traffic, to aid in stabilizing property values,to develop centers of size and location compatible with marked potential green spaces and to

Suchrequirements which are made a part of an approved recorded specific implementation plan agreedupon by the owner and the City shall be construed, with the recorded plan itself, as a part of thisarticle.
§ 430-52. Criteria for approval.
As a basis for determining the acceptability of a planned unit development district application, thefollowing criteria shall be applied with specific consideration as to whether or not it is consistent withthe spirit and intent of this article and has the potential for producing significant community benefits interms of environmental and aesthetic design:
Character and intensity of land use. In a planned unit development district the uses and theirintensity, appearance and arrangement shall be of a visual and operational character which:
Is compatible with the physical nature of the site or area;
Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic desirability, economic stabilityand functional practicality compatible with the general development plan;
Would not adversely affect the anticipated provision for school or other municipal serviceunless jointly resolved; and
Would not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with existing or proposed facilities.
Economic impact. A planned unit development shall not adversely affect the economic prosperityof the City or of surrounding properties.

§ 430-55. Intent; findings.
The Special Exception Overlay District is established to provide a procedure to regulate structuralmodifications and additions within the district. The Special Exception Overlay District boundaries havebeen established by locating residential lots that were platted for the most part prior to the 1960's. Itwas common at that time to have lots 66 feet wide or less. Home construction often incorporated atwo-story structure on a relatively narrow lot, frequently without a garage.
As uses of these homes today often involve the need for additional garage space and otheradditions to the home itself, property owners found that the limited lot area in the older areas ofthe City necessitated that variances be granted for many of their proposed projects.
In order to address these needs the special exception procedure will eliminate many of thevariance requests. This process will incorporate flexibility into this chapter for the areas described,encourage neighborhood-sensitive decisions, and encourage input from neighbors.

Nontypical adjacency to abutting property, e.g.:
Side or rear yard adjacent to a public right-of-way.
Side yard adjacent to the rear yard of another parcel.
Significant vegetation or topography that makes compliance with setback requirements difficult,e.g.:
Mature trees limit buildable lot area; and
