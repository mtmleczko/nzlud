Preface
The Village of Holmen has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the Village, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the Village. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the Village Board ordered the following codification of the Village's legislation.

Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Village Board of the Village of Holmen, including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the Village Board in the course of the codification.

Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters
The various items of legislation are organized into chapters, their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus, for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in Part II, in the chapter entitled "Streets and Sidewalks." In such chapters, use of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation.

Table of Contents
The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation.

Reserved Chapters
Unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the Table of Contents but are available for assignment to new enactments. In this manner, new subject matter can be included alphabetically.

Pagination
A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral "1." Thus, Chapter 6 would begin on page 6:1. By the use of this system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages.

Numbering of Sections
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 would be § 6-1, while the fourth section of Chapter 53 would be § 53-4.

Scheme
The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.

Histories
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number, resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of each part or article is indicated in the text, under its title. Amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.

Codification Amendments and Revisions
New chapters adopted during the process of codification are specifically enumerated in chapter Histories with reference to "Ch. 1, General Provisions," where the legislation adopting this Code and making such revisions will appear after final enactment. Sections amended or revised are indicated in the text by means of Editor's Notes referring to the chapter cited above.

General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's Notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information and cross-references to related provisions in other chapters.

Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include.

Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication of the Code, indicating its inclusion in the Code or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement.

Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this Code will be used by persons without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The Index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the Code.

Instructions for Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or complete new additions, should be adopted as amending the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered.

Adding new sections. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at the end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between §§ 65-5 and 65-6 should be designated § 65-5.1).

Adding new chapters. New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in the appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation), utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles, Abandoned" under "V" in the table of contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under "A" in the table of contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 166 and 167 should be designated Chapter 166A).

Adding new articles. New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g., adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA). The section numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA contains six sections and existing Article XVI ends with § 166-30 and Article XVII begins with § 166-31, Article XVIA should contain §§ 166-30.1 through 166-30.6). NOTE: In chapters where articles appear on the Table of Contents, simply add new articles to the end of the chapter since they are not arranged by subject matter.

Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation or amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old pages removed, in accordance with the Instruction Page which accompanies each supplement.

Acknowledgment
The assistance of the Village officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The codification of the legislation of the Village of Holmen reflects an appreciation of the needs of a progressive and expanding community. As in many other municipalities, officials are faced with fundamental changes involving nearly every facet of community life. Problems increase in number and complexity and range in importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning. It is the profound conviction of General Code that this Code will contribute significantly to the efficient administration of local government. As Samuel Johnson observed, "The law is the last result of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the benefit of the public."

If the owner obtains the dog or cat or brings the dog or cat into the Village of Holmen after the dog or cat has reached five months of age, the owner shall have the dog or cat vaccinated against rabies within 30 days after the dog or cat is brought into the village unless the dog or cat has been vaccinated as evidenced by a current certificate of rabies vaccination.

The certificate of vaccination shall meet the requirements of Section 95.21(2), Wis. Stats.[4] 

B.     Issuance of certificate of rabies vaccination.

The owner shall attach the rabies vaccination tag or a substitute tag to a collar and a collar with the tag attached shall be kept on the dog or cat at all times, but this requirement does not apply to a dog or cat during competition.

The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to a dog or cat which is not required to be vaccinated under Subsection A. 

F.      Duplicate tag. The veterinarian may furnish a new rabies vaccination tag with a new serial number to an owner in place of the original tag upon presentation of the certificate of rabies vaccination.

(1)    It shall be unlawful for any person in the Village of Holmen to own, harbor or keep any dog more than five months of age without complying with the provisions of Section 174.05 through Section 174.10, Wisconsin Statutes, relating to the listing, licensing and tagging of the same. 

(2)    The owner of any dog more than five months of age on January 1 of any year, or five months of age within the license year, shall annually, or on or before the date the dog becomes five months of age, pay a license tax and obtain a license. 

(3)    The minimum license tax under this section shall be the license fee charged by La Crosse County plus a $1 village administrative fee for spayed female or neutered male dogs. The minimum fee for unspayed or unneutered dogs shall be the license fee charged by La Crosse County plus a $1 village administrative fee. 

(4)    Upon payment of the required license tax and upon presentation of evidence that the dog is currently immunized against rabies, as required by § 14-8 of this chapter, the Village Clerk shall complete and issue to the owner a license for such dog containing all information required by state law. The Village Clerk shall also deliver to the owner, at the time of issuance of the license, a tag of durable material bearing the same serial number as the license, the name of the county in which issued and the license year. 

(5)    The owner shall securely attach the tag to a collar and the collar with the tag attached shall be kept on the dog for which the license is issued at all times, except as provided in § 14-8E. 

(6)    The fact that a dog is without a tag attached to the dog by means of a collar shall be presumptive evidence that the dog is unlicensed. Any village police or humane officer shall seize, impound or restrain any dog for which a dog license is required which is found without such tag attached. 

(7)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, every dog specifically trained to lead blind or deaf persons is exempt from the dog license tax, and every person owning such a dog shall receive annually a free dog license from Village Clerk upon application therefor.   

B.     Kennel licenses. 

(1)    Any person who keeps or operates a kennel shall, instead of the license tax for each dog required by this chapter, apply for a kennel license for the keeping or operating of the kennel. Such person shall pay for the license year a license tax of $30 for a kennel of 12 or fewer dogs and an additional $3 for each dog in excess of 12. Upon payment of the required kennel license tax and, if required by the village, upon presentation of evidence that all dogs over five months of age are currently immunized against rabies, the Village Clerk shall issue the kennel license and a number of tags equal to the number of dogs authorized to be kept in the kennel. Kennels may only be located in agricultural areas after a conditional use permit has been issued pursuant to Chapter 195, Zoning. 

(2)    The owner or keeper of a kennel shall keep at all times a kennel license tag attached to the collar of each dog over five months old kept by the owner or keeper under a kennel license, but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition. These tags may be transferred from one dog to another within the kennel whenever any dog is removed from the kennel. The rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag shall remain attached to the dog for which it is issued at all times, but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition. No dog bearing a kennel tag shall be permitted to stray or to be taken anywhere outside the limits of the kennel unless the dog is on a leash or is temporarily used for the purposes of hunting, breeding, trial, training or competition.     

§ 14-10.  Late fees.

The Village Clerk or County Clerk shall assess and collect a late fee as established by La Crosse County from every owner of a dog five months of age or over if the owner failed to obtain a license prior to April 1 of each year, or within 30 days of acquiring ownership of a licensable dog or if the owner failed to obtain a license on or before the dog reached licensable age. Said late fee shall be charged in addition to the required license fee.[5] 

§ 14-11.  Rabies quarantine. 

A.     Dogs and cats confined. If a district is quarantined for rabies, all dogs and cats within the village shall be kept securely confined, tied, leashed or muzzled.

The Village Clerk shall promptly post in at least three public places in the village notices of quarantine.[6] 

B.     Exemption of vaccinated dog or cat from city quarantine. A dog or cat which is immunized currently against rabies, as evidenced by a valid certificate of rabies vaccination or other evidence, is exempt from the village quarantine provisions of Subsection A if a rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag is attached to the dog's or cat's collar. 

C.     Quarantine or sacrifice of an animal suspected of biting a person or being infected or exposed to rabies. 

(1)    Quarantine or sacrifice of dog or cat. An officer shall order a dog or cat quarantined if the officer has reason to believe that the animal bit a person, is infected with rabies or has been in contact with a rabid animal. If a quarantine cannot be imposed because the dog or cat cannot be captured, the officer may kill the animal only as a last resort. The officer shall attempt to kill the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's head. 

(2)    Health risk to humans. If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal under strict isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at least 10 days after the incident occurred.   

D.     Quarantine of dog or cat. 

(1)    Delivery to isolation facility or quarantine on premises of owner. An officer who orders a dog or cat to be quarantined shall deliver the animal or shall order the animal delivered to an isolation facility as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the original order is issued or the officer may order the animal to be quarantined on the premises of the owner if the animal is immunized currently against rabies as evidenced by a valid certificate of rabies vaccination or other evidence. 

(2)    Health risk to humans. If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal under strict isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at least 10 days after the incident occurred. In this paragraph, "supervision of a veterinarian" includes, at a minimum, examination of the animal on the first day of isolation, on the last day of isolation and on one intervening day. If the observation period is not extended and if the veterinarian certifies that the dog or cat has not exhibited any signs of rabies, the animal may be released from quarantine at the end of the observation period. 

(3)    Risk to animal health.  

(a)     If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal and if the dog or cat is not currently immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for 180 days. The owner shall have the animal vaccinated against rabies between 155 and 165 days after the exposure to a rabid animal.  

(b)     If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal but if the dog or cat is immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for 60 days. The owner shall have the animal revaccinated against rabies as soon as possible after exposure to a rabid animal.   

(4)    Sacrifice of a dog or cat exhibiting symptoms of rabies. If a veterinarian determines that a dog or cat exhibits symptoms of rabies during the original or extended observation period, the veterinarian shall notify the owner and the officer who ordered the animal quarantined, and the officer or veterinarian shall kill the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's head.

Chapter 25 Brush, Grass and Weeds

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Village Board of the Village of Holmen 1-8-1998. Amendments noted where applicable.]

§ 25-1.  Purpose.
This chapter is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow excessive length in the Village.

§ 25-2.  Public nuisance declared.
The Village Board finds that lawns, grasses and noxious weeds, on lots or parcels of land, which exceed eight inches in length adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to admit pollen and other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interfere with the public convenience and adversely affect property values of other land within the Village. For that reason any lawn, grass or weeds, on a lot or parcel of land, which exceed eight inches in length are hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designated floodplain and/or a designated wetland area or where, in the opinion of the Village, is an acceptable natural area.

§ 25-3.  Nuisances prohibited; persons responsible for prevention; exemption. [Amended 1-14-2010 by Ord. No. 2.09]
No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as defined in § 25-2 above to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him or her within the Village.
Any street, road or highway right-of-way fronting upon a parcel of land is considered for the purposes of this chapter to be controlled by the owner of such parcel of land, and the owner of such parcel of land is therefore responsible for cutting grasses and weeds within such right-of-way so as to prevent any public nuisance as defined in § 25-2 above from remaining.
Parcels zoned as A - Agricultural District are exempt from the requirements of this chapter.   
§ 25-4.  Inspection.
The Weed Commissioner or his/her designee shall inspect or cause to be inspected all premises and places within the Village to determine whether any public nuisance as defined in § 25-2 above exists. If the Weed Commissioner is denied entry to the premises, he/she may seek an inspection warrant pursuant to Sec. 66.122, Wis. Statutes.

§ 25-5.  Abatement of nuisance. [Amended 11-9-2000 by Ord. No. 2.00; 1-14-2010 by Ord. No. 2.09]
If the Weed Commissioner or his/her designee shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance as defined in § 25-2 above exists, he/she shall immediately cause notice to be given to the owner of the parcel responsible for preventing any such nuisance from remaining that the owner has five days after the notice is given to have the grasses or weeds cut so as to conform with this chapter. The first time that a public nuisance is determined to exist on a parcel of land, notice to the owner of the parcel shall be in written form, and confirmation of receipt of the notice by the intended recipient shall be verified. Whenever a change of ownership of a parcel of land occurs, the first determination of the existence of a public nuisance to occur after the date the change in ownership occurs shall be considered the first determination for that parcel of land. Any subsequent notices may be given verbally or via telephone, e-mail or any other manner in which receipt of the notice by the intended recipient is reasonably expected to occur.
In any case where the owner of a property shall fail to cut any grasses or weeds that constitute a public nuisance on any property owned or controlled by him/her within the required five days as set forth above, the Village may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
The Village shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject's property and shall charge the fee of $200 or actual cost, whichever is greater, to the property owner. If said statement is not paid in full within 30 days thereafter, the Village Clerk shall enter the charge in the tax roll as a special tax against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate, or as provided under Sec. 66.60(16), Wis. Statutes.

The licensee further agrees to pay such reasonable fees for such tests and for installation inspections as the Village Board may establish. The licensee's distribution systems shall conform to the requirements of the FCC, particularly with respect to freedom from spurious radiation.

The licensee shall maintain a La Crosse County business office where the licensee shall provide for a reasonable method of processing and resolving complaints of subscribers and shall keep a record of each subscriber complaint lodged and the resolution, if any, of the problem. This record shall be open to inspection by the Village Board or the Village Clerk at reasonable times during business hours. Complaints shall be handled by the licensee in a courteous and efficient manner at all times.

Any discrepancy between the previous year's franchise fee paid and the amount verified in the annual report shall be reflected in the June payment.

The cable system shall pay the village 1 1/2% interest per month on all due but unpaid franchise fees.
The village shall have the right to inspect the licensee's records showing the average number of active subscribers the first of each month and the gross subscriber revenues from service in the area governed by the village based upon which its license payments are computed and shall have the right to audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under the license.  
§ 38-20.  Subscriber rights.
No monitoring of any terminal connected to the system shall take place without, on each occasion, except sweeps for the purpose of system integrity, specific written authorization by the user at the terminal in question.

§ 56-3.  Legislative findings.
The Village Board of the Village of Holmen finds that construction site erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land-disturbing and land development activities have significant adverse impacts upon regional water resources and the health, safety, property and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically soil erosion and stormwater runoff can:
Carry sediment, nutrients, pathogens, organic matter, heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants to regional lakes, streams and wetlands.
Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life.
Clog existing drainage systems, increasing maintenance problems and costs.
Cause bank and channel erosion.
Increase downstream flooding.
Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in regional lakes, ponds and wetlands.
Contaminate drinking water supplies.
Increase risk of property damage and personal injury.
Cause damage to agricultural fields and crops.
The Village Board of the Village of Holmen also finds that effective sediment and stormwater management depends on proper planning, design and timely installation of conservation and management practices and their continuing maintenance.  
§ 56-4.  Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management that will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the Village of Holmen.
This chapter is intended to regulate construction site erosion and stormwater runoff, to accomplish the following objectives:
Promote regional stormwater management by watershed.
Minimize sedimentation, water pollutions from nutrients, heavy metals, chemical and petroleum products and other contaminants, flooding and thermal impacts to the water resources of the Village of Holmen.
Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge.
Protect functional values of natural watercourses and wetlands.
Provide a set of performance standards that are consistent with the standards set forth by La Crosse County.
Achieve a reduction of 80% in sediment load rates to La Crosse County waters compared to no controls for all new development, a reduction of 40% in sediment load rates compared to no controls for all redevelopment and street reconstruction, and a reduction of 20% in sediment load rates compared to no controls for existing developments.
Ensure no increase in temperature of stormwater post-construction in order to protect cold water communities.
Ensure no increase in the rate of surface water drainage from sites during or after construction.
Protect public and private property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion.    
§ 56-5.  Applicability of requirement for erosion control permits.

If the owner or person performing the work is not readily available, that person refuses to voluntarily comply immediately or the noncompliance presents an imminent danger or will cause or threatens to cause bodily injury or damage to off-site property, including, but not limited to, off-site runoff, the local approval authority shall post in a conspicuous place on the premises, a stop-work order which shall cause all activity not necessary to correct the noncompliance to cease until noncompliance is corrected.
The stop-work order shall provide the following information: date of issuance, identifying information, reason for posting and the signature of the inspector posting the card.
It shall be a violation of the chapter for the unauthorized removal of the stop-work order from the premises.
In addition to posting a stop-work order, the local approval authority shall provide notification to the owner or contractor by personal service, written notice by certified mail or facsimile transmission.
The permittee, landowner and contractor shall have 24 hours from the time and date of notification by the local approval authority to correct any noncompliance with the plan, when notification is by either personal communication of noncompliance to the owner or contractor or their respective agents or written notice sent by certified mail to the owner or contractor.
If notice is not provided under Subsection H(5), the permittee and landowner shall have 72 hours to correct any noncompliance with the plan when notification is by posting notice in a conspicuous place on the site or sending notice by facsimile transmission to the owner or contractor.
If any noncompliance is not corrected within the time periods specified in Subsection H(5) or (6), the permittee and landowner authorize the local approval authority to take any action, to perform any work or to commence any operations necessary to correct conditions upon the subject property where notice of noncompliance has been issued to bring the property into conformance with plan requirements. The permittee and landowner further consent to reimburse the authority for the total costs and expenses of the aforementioned actions, said reimbursement may be collected as a special charge upon the property for current services rendered as provided by law.
If the permittee has filed an appeal under § 56-14A(1) prior to the expiration of the time for compliance under Subsection H(6), the local approval authority may take action, perform work or correct conditions only to the extent necessary to protect against or correct an imminent hazard or a condition that will cause or threatens to cause personal injury or damage to off-site property.
Penalties.
Any person or persons, firm, company or corporation, owner, occupant or other user of the premises who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100 nor more than $500 and costs. Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
Any person who has the ability to pay any forfeiture entered against him or her under this chapter, but refuses to do so, may be confined in the county jail until such forfeiture is paid, but in no event to exceed 30 days. In determining whether an individual has the ability to pay a forfeiture, all items of income and all assets may be considered regardless of whether or not such income or assets are subject to garnishment, lien or attachment by creditors.
As a substitute for or as an addition to forfeiture actions under Subsection I(1) or corrective action under Subsection H(7), the Village Attorney is authorized to seek enforcement of any part of this chapter by court action seeking injunctive relief. It shall not be necessary for the Village to take corrective action or prosecute for forfeiture before resorting to injunctive relief.
Fees. The permit fee shall be payable at the time an application for either an erosion control or a stormwater management permit, or both, is submitted.  
§ 56-10.  Erosion control plan requirements.

If required under Subsection B(7)(a) a description and plans to control temperature of runoff.
A maintenance plan and schedule for all permanent stormwater management practices as recorded on the affidavit required in § 56-9.
Stormwater management performance standards. Proposed design, suggested location and phased implementation of effective, practicable stormwater management measures for plans shall be designed, engineered and implemented to achieve the following results:
Sediment control.
For new construction, design practices to retain soil particles greater than five microns on the site (reduction of 80%) resulting from a one-year twenty-four-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension.
For redevelopment resulting in exposed surface parking lots and associated traffic areas, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns on the entire site (reduction of 40%) resulting from a one-year twenty-four-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. Under no circumstances shall the site's existing sediment control level or trapping efficiency be reduced as a result of the redevelopment.
Oil and grease control. For all stormwater plans for commercial or industrial developments and all other uses where the potential for pollution by oil or grease, or both, exists, the first 0.5 inch of runoff will be treated using the best oil and grease removal technology available. This requirement may be waived by the plan reviewer only when the applicant can demonstrate that installation of such practices is not necessary.
Runoff rate control: hydrologic calculations. All runoff calculations shall be according to methodology described in the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" (commonly known as "TR-55"), or other methodology approved by the La Crosse County Conservationist. For agricultural land subject to this section, the maximum runoff curve number (RCN) used in such calculations shall be 51 for HSG A, 68 for Hydrolic Soil Group B, 79 for HSG C, and 84 for HSG D. The TR-55 specified curve numbers for other land uses shall be used for heavily disturbed sites and will be lowered one permeability class for hydrologic calculations. Lightly disturbed areas require no modification. Where practices have been implemented to restore soil structure to predeveloped conditions, no permeability class modification is required.
Runoff rate control: design standards. All stormwater facilities shall be designed, installed and maintained to effectively accomplish the following:
Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the two-year, twenty-four-hour storm event (2.9 inches over 24 hours' duration).
Maintain predevelopment peak runoff rates for the ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm event (4.2 inches over 24 hours' duration).
Safely pass the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm event (6.0 inches over twenty-four-hour duration).
Outlets. Discharges from new construction sites must have a stable outlet capable of carrying designed flow as required in Subsection B(4), at a nonerosive velocity. Outlet design must consider flow capacity and flow duration. This requirement applies to both the site outlet and the ultimate outlet to stormwater conveyance or water body.
Infiltration. All downspouts, driveways and other impervious areas shall be directed to pervious surfaces, where feasible, or unless the applicant can demonstrate that the practice is likely to result in groundwater contamination.
Thermal control.
The stormwater management plan shall include provisions and practices to reduce the temperature of runoff for sites located within the watershed of a river or stream identified by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as:
A cold water community as identified through NR 102.04(3)(a), NR 104, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and Class I, Class II and Class III Trout Streams identified in "Wisconsin Trout Streams," DNR publication 6-3600(80) or its successor.
Rivers or streams proposed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as cold water communities and Class I, II and III Trout Streams.
Thermal control, continued. The stormwater management plan does not have to meet the requirements in Subsection B(7)(a) if the applicant can justify by use of a model approved by the La Crosse County Conservationist that practices are not necessary because the temperature increase of runoff from the site postdevelopment will be zero.
Thermal control, continued. A current list and maps of affected watersheds shall be available for reference at the office of the local approval authority and the plan review agency.
Stormwater management goals. The following standards shall be met whenever possible, and proposed design, suggested location and implementation of practices to meet these goals shall be included in plans:
For existing development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 40 microns on the site (reduction of 20%) resulting from a one-year, twenty-four-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension.
For street reconstruction, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns on the site (reduction of 40%) resulting from a one-year, twenty-four-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension.      
§ 56-12.  Off-site stormwater management.
Off-site stormwater management is allowed, provided that all of the following conditions for the off-site facility are met:
The facility is in place.
The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that at least meets the chapter standards.
The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance.  
§ 56-13.  Technical standards and specifications.
The design of all best management practices designed to meet the requirements of this chapter shall comply with the following technical standards:
Natural Resources Conservation Service's "Field Office Technical Guide, Chapter 4," or its successor.
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' "Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook," or its successor.
Any other technical methodology approved by the La Crosse County Conservationist.  
§ 56-14.  Appeals and variances.
Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the local approval authority pursuant to this chapter may appeal to the Village Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be taken within 45 days after the challenged decision. Notice of appeal setting forth the specific grounds for the appeal shall be filed with the local approval authority and the Board of Appeals. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit the record upon which the action was taken.
The Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and publish a Class 2 notice thereof under Chapter 985, Wisconsin Statutes, as well as give due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
The Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of four members of the Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse the decision of the local approval authority.
Variances.
An applicant may include in the application a request for a variance from the requirements of §§ 56-10 and 56-11. No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates and the local approval authority, after consultation with the County Conservationist, finds that all of the following conditions are present:
Enforcement of the standards set forth in this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship to the landowner.
The hardship is due to exceptional physical conditions unique to the property.
Granting the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, nor be contrary to the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter.
The project will have no impact upon any of the stated purposes of this chapter as set forth in § 56-4.
The applicant has proposed an alternative to the requirement from which the variance is sought that will provide equivalent protection to the public health, safety and welfare, the environment and public and private property.
The net cumulative effect of the variance will not impact downstream conditions.
Existing regional facilities are shown to meet the performance standards of this chapter.
If all of the conditions set forth in Subsection B(1) are met, a variance may only be granted to the minimum extent necessary to afford relief from the unnecessary hardship, with primary consideration to water quality.
A variance from the provisions of § 56-11B(1), (2), and (7)(a) may only be granted if:
The applicant has met the requirements of § 56-14B(1).
The applicant will be denied all reasonable and beneficial use of the property if the variance is denied.
A person aggrieved by a variance determination by the local approval authority may appeal the decision to the Board of Appeals pursuant to Subsection A.
A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Appeals regarding a variance may appeal that decision to the La Crosse County Circuit Court.    
§ 56-15.  Permit fees.
The Village Board shall establish a fee schedule for erosion control and stormwater management permits.

ARTICLE I Statutory Authority; Finding of Fact; Purpose; Title; General Provisions

§ 71-1.  Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23, Wis. Stats., for villages and cities; §§ 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694, Wis. Stats., for counties; and the requirements in § 87.30, Wis. Stats.

§ 71-2.  Finding of fact.
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.

§ 71-3.  Statement of purpose.
This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
Protect life, health and property
Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and
Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.   
§ 71-4.  Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Holmen, Wisconsin."

§ 71-5.  General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood.  ** Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Official maps and revisions.
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A Zones on the maps listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Village Clerk, Village of Holmen. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive approved information shall apply.
Official maps:
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Panel Numbers 55063C0020D, 55063C0133D, 55063C0134D, 55063C0135D, 55063C0142D, 55063C0151D, 55063C0153D, and 55063C0161D, and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) numbers 55063CV001B and 55063CV002B, all dated January 6, 2012.
Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection D(1) or (2) below. If a significant difference exists, the Map shall be amended according to Article VIII. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to § 71-28C, Subsection D(1) and (2) and the criteria in below.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department. ** Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to § 71-32F.
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Article VIII.  **Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC).
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2002, Wis. Stats., applies.
Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694, Wis. Stats., for counties; § 62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities; or § 61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages; or § 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.
Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.
Annexed areas for cities and villages. The La Crosse County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
General development standards. The Village shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standard. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured homes) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter.    
ARTICLE II General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain Districts

§ 71-6.  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.

Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or
Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot.
The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Subsection C are met.
Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are made to this chapter, the official Floodplain Zoning Maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with Article VIII. Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR.   
§ 71-7.  Watercourse alterations.
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The flood-carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, the Zoning Administrator shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting appropriate technical or scientific data in accordance with NFIP guidelines that shall be used to revise the FIRM, risk premium rates and floodplain management regulations as required.   
§ 71-8.  Development under Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats.
Development which requires a permit from the Department, under Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the floodway lines, water surface profiles, BFEs established in the FIS, or other data from the officially adopted FIRM, or other floodplain zoning maps or the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance are made according to Article VIII.

§ 71-9.  Public or private campgrounds.
Public or private campgrounds shall have a low flood damage potential and shall meet the following provisions:
The campground is approved by the Department of Health Services.
A land use permit for the campground is issued by the Zoning Administrator.
The character of the river system and the elevation of the campground are such that a seventy-two-hour warning of an impending flood can be given to all campground occupants.
There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground that offers the minimum notice required under this section to all persons in the campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator and the chief law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for conducting the evacuation.
This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated, by the officials identified in Subsection D, to remain in compliance with all applicable regulations, including those of the state Department of Health Services and all other applicable regulations.
Only easily removable tents and mobile recreational vehicles are allowed.
The camping units may not occupy any site in the campground for more than 180 consecutive days, at which time the camping unit must be removed from the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours.
All camping units that remain on site for more than 30 days shall be issued a limited authorization by the campground operator, a written copy of which is kept on file at the campground. Such authorization shall allow placement of a camping unit for a period not to exceed 180 days and shall ensure compliance with all the provisions of this section.
The municipality shall monitor the limited authorizations issued by the campground operator to assure compliance with the terms of this section.
All structures that do not meet the definition of a camping unit or mobile recreational vehicle, or that remain in place for more than 180 consecutive days, must meet the applicable requirements in either Article III or Article IV for the floodplain district in which the structure is located.
The campground shall have signs clearly posted at all entrances warning of the flood hazard and the procedures for evacuation when a flood warning is issued.
All service facilities, including but not limited to refuse collection, electrical service, natural gas lines, propane tanks, sewage systems and wells shall be properly anchored and placed at or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation.

Where the provisions of § 71-26A(3) apply, the applicant shall provide all required information and computations to delineate floodway boundaries and the effects of the project on flood elevations.    
ARTICLE VI Nonconforming Uses

§ 71-21.  Applicability; conditions for continuance.
Applicability. If these standards conform to § 59.69(10), Wis. Stats., for counties or § 62.23(7)(h), Wis. Stats., for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any amendment thereto.
The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue subject to the following conditions:
No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered modifications or additions; these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities.
If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted, and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter.
The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent.
No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with § 71-16A.
Destruction or damage of structures.
Except as provided in Subsection B(5)(b), if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meets the ordinance requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its predamaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the structure's present equalized assessed value.
For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA regulations (44 CFR Part 60), or the regulations promulgated thereunder.
A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, the alteration will comply with § 71-12A, flood-resistant materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that comply with § 71-30 are used.     
§ 71-22.  Floodway areas.
No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use in a floodway area, unless such modification or addition:
Has been granted a permit or variance which meets all ordinance requirements;
Meets the requirements of § 71-21;
Will not increase the obstruction to flood flows or regional flood height; and
Any addition to the existing structure shall be floodproofed, pursuant to § 71-30; by means other than the use of fill, to the flood protection elevation.
If any part of the foundation below the flood protection elevation is enclosed, the following standards shall apply:
The enclosed area shall be designed by a registered architect or engineer to allow for the efficient entry and exit of floodwaters without human intervention. A minimum of two openings must be provided with a minimum net area of at least one square inch for every one square foot of the enclosed area. The lowest part of the opening can be no more than 12 inches above the adjacent grade;
The parts of the foundation located below the flood protection elevation must be constructed of flood-resistant materials;
Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the flood protection elevation; and
The use must be limited to parking or limited storage.
No new on-site sewage disposal system, or addition to an existing on-site sewage disposal system, except where an addition has been ordered by a government agency to correct a hazard to public health, shall be allowed in a floodway area. Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an existing on-site sewage disposal system in a floodway area shall meet the applicable requirements of all municipal ordinances and Ch. Comm 83, Wis. Adm. Code.
No new well or modification to an existing well used to obtain potable water shall be allowed in a floodway area. Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an existing well in a floodway area shall meet the applicable requirements of all municipal ordinances and Chs. NR 811 and NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code.   
§ 71-23.  Flood-fringe areas.
No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use unless such modification or addition has been granted a permit or variance by the municipality, and the modification or addition shall be placed on fill or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in compliance with the standards for that particular use in § 71-16, except where § 71-23B is applicable.
Where compliance with the provisions of Subsection A would result in unnecessary hardship and only where the structure will not be used for human habitation or be associated with a high flood-damage potential, the Board of Adjustment/Appeals, using the procedures established in § 71-28, may grant a variance from those provisions of Subsection A for modifications or additions, using the criteria listed below. Modifications or additions which are protected to elevations lower than the flood protection elevation may be permitted if:
No floor is allowed below the regional flood elevation for residential or commercial structures;
Human lives are not endangered;
Public facilities, such as water or sewer, will not be installed;
Flood depths will not exceed two feet;
Flood velocities will not exceed two feet per second; and
The structure will not be used for storage of materials as described in § 71-16E.
If neither the provisions of Subsection A nor B above can be met, one addition to an existing room in a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use may be allowed in the flood-fringe, if the addition:
Meets all other regulations and will be granted by permit or variance;

§ 76-1.  Purpose; intent. 

The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community and to facilitate the adequate provision of parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities; storm and surface water collection and treatment facilities; water pumping, storage and distribution facilities; fire, police and emergency medical facilities; highways and transportation facilities; traffic control facilities; library facilities; sewage collection and treatment facilities; and solid waste and recycling facilities by imposing impact fees upon developers to pay for the capital costs of public facilities that are necessary to accommodate land development. 
This chapter is intended to impose impact fees in order to finance public utilities and facilities, the demand for which is generated by new residential development. The Village is responsible for and will meet, through the use of general Village revenues, all capital improvement needs associated with existing development. Only needs created by new development will be met by impact fees. Impact fees shall be spent on new or enlarged capital facilities improvements required by new developments that pay the fees.   
§ 76-2.  Statutory authority.

§ 76-5.  Public facilities needs assessment. [Amended 12-8-2016 by Ord. No. 10-2016]

The basis for the imposition of impact fees is the Public Facilities Needs Assessment prepared by MSA Professional Services, Inc., in October/November of 2016, which is on file in the office of the Village Clerk and available for inspection and/or copying in accordance with the State Public Records and Property Law, Subchapter II of Chapter 19, Wisconsin Statutes. The public facilities need assessment includes:  

An inventory of existing public facilities, including an identification of any existing deficiencies in the quantity or quality of those public facilities for which an impact fee is imposed. 
An identification of the new public facilities, or improvements or expansions of existing public facilities that will be required because of land development for which an impact fee is imposed. 
A detailed estimate of the capital costs of providing the new public facilities or the improvements or expansions in existing public facilities, including an estimate of the effect of recovering these capital costs through impact fees on the availability of affordable housing within the Village.   
§ 76-6.  Fees found to be reasonable and in compliance.

Impact fees imposed by this chapter are found by the Village Board of the Village to be reasonable and in compliance with § 66.55, Wis. Stats.,[1] in that they: 

Bear a rational relationship to the need for new, expanded or improved public facilities that are required to serve land development. 
Do not exceed the proportionate share of the capital costs that are required to serve land development, as compared to existing uses of land within the Village. 
Are based upon actual capital costs or reasonable estimates of capital costs for new, expanded or improved public facilities. 
Do not prohibit or deter the construction of affordable housing within the Village.   
§ 76-7.  Reduction of or exemption from fees. 

Impact fees imposed by this chapter shall be reduced to the extent necessary: 
(1)    To compensate for other capital costs imposed by the Village with respect to land development to provide or pay for public facilities, including special assessments, special charges, land dedications or fees in lieu of land dedications under Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes, or any other items of value. 

(2)    To compensate for monies received from federal or state government specifically to provide or pay for the public facilities for which the impact fees are imposed.   

The Village Board may, in its discretion, provide for an exemption from, or a reduction in the amount of impact fees imposed on a developer that provides low-cost housing in accordance with guidelines established by the Village Board, except no amount of any impact fee for which an exemption or reduction is provided under this section may be shifted to any other development in the land development in which the low-cost housing is located or to any other land development in the Village. 
New development in a tax incremental financing district, whether such district is now existing or created in the future, may be exempted from the imposition of impact fees for the reason that the Village desires to offer developers an incentive to create projects which will improve blighted neighborhoods and/or create opportunities for employment.   
§ 76-8.  Imposition of fees.

Impact fees shall be imposed by the Village Board on any land division, planned development, conditional use permit, site plan review or building permit for new construction on vacant land, the construction of additional buildings on developed land, and the expansion of existing buildings, at the time any approval or permit is granted which is located in an area on which an impact fee has been imposed. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein required shall provide for the payment of duplicate impact fees under circumstances where a land development is the subject of more than one approval or permit. 

§ 76-9.  Use of funds. 

Funds collected from impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the proportionate costs of providing public facilities that may become necessary due to land development. These costs may include the costs of debt service on bonds or similar debt instruments when the debt has been incurred for the purpose of proceeding with designated public facilities projects prior to the collection of all anticipated impact fees for the projects, to reimburse the Village or utility for advances of other funds or reserves, and such other purposes consistent with § 66.0617, Wis. Stats., which are recorded and approved by the Village Board. 
The Village may issue bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of indebtedness in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law in furtherance of the provision of capital improvement projects. Funds pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue certificates, or other obligations of indebtedness for such projects may include impact fees and other Village revenues as may be allowed by the Village Board. Impact fees paid pursuant to this chapter, however, shall be restricted to use solely and exclusively for financing directly or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of indebtedness for the cost of capital improvements as specified herein. 
These impact fees shall be collected until the capital costs associated with the projects specified in the Public Facilities Needs Assessment Report, as amended from time to time, have been incurred and satisfied. Said impact fees shall be used within the time periods specified in §§ 76-10C and 76-13 of this chapter. [Amended 12-8-2016 by Ord. No. 10-2016]   
§ 76-10.  Payment and collection of fees. 

Payment of fee. A developer shall pay an impact fee for any new development (as distinguished from any alteration or addition to existing development) in full, to the Village Clerk or Treasurer, where applicable, as follows: 
(1)    With respect to a land division, within the time provided in a subdividers agreement. 

(2)    With respect to conditional use permits, as provided in the permit. 

(3)    With respect to site plan review, prior to obtaining a building permit. 

(4)    With respect to a building permit, prior to issuance of the permit.   

Separate fund account required. Revenues collected as impact fees shall be placed by the Village of Holmen Treasurer in segregated interest-bearing accounts and shall be accounted for separately from other funds of the Village of Holmen. Impact fee revenues and interest earned on impact fee revenues may be expended by the Village of Holmen only for the capital costs for which the impact fees were imposed and shall be expended on a first-in first-out basis. 
Refund. Impact fees that are collected by the Village within seven years of the effective date of this chapter, for any facility described in the needs assessment, but are not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following 10 years after the effective date of this chapter, shall be returned to such landowner along with any interest that has accumulated in accordance with § 66.0617(9)(a), Wis. Stats. [Amended 12-8-2016 by Ord. No. 10-2016]   
§ 76-11.  Administration of fees. 

Upon receipt of impact fees, the Village Clerk, Treasurer or the utility manager, as applicable, shall be responsible for the placement of such funds into separate accounts as hereinafter specified. All such funds shall be deposited in interest-bearing accounts in a bank authorized to receive deposits of Village or utility funds, as applicable. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds of such account. 
The Village Clerk, Treasurer or utility manager shall maintain and keep accurate financial records for each such account that shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues; that shall account for all monies received; that shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used for projects in the capital improvements program for the particular development subarea or for Village-wide capital improvements, as specified in the program; and that shall provide an annual report for each impact fee account showing the source and amount of all funds collected and the projects that were funded. 
Review of development potential, capital improvements program and impact fees. 
(1)    The Village shall annually, in conjunction with the annual capital budget and capital improvements plan adoption processes, review the development potential of the Village and the capital improvements plan and make such modifications as are deemed necessary as a result of:  

(a)     Development occurring in the prior year.  

(b)     Capital improvements actually constructed.  

(c)     Changing facility needs.  

(d)     Inflation.  

(e)     Revised cost estimates for capital improvements.  

(f)     Changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to public facility projects.  

(g)     Such other factors as may be relevant.   

(2)    Modifications of the development potential, the capital improvements program, and the impact fees shall be recommended for adoption prior to December 1 of each year and shall be effective on January 1.

The notice of appeal shall state in detail the relief sought by the developer and any legal or factual basis for the relief requested; and shall include all supporting documentation upon which the developer relies in making the appeal. 
Appeal bond. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the Village Attorney in an amount equal to the impact fee due, as calculated by the Village Clerk or the Clerk's designee, and all other requirements have been satisfied, the plumbing or building permit may be issued or the final plan may be approved.

§ 76-16.  Fees requirement in addition to other requirements.

The impact fees are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the Village on the development of land or the issuance of building permits. It is intended to be consistent with and to further the objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, the capital improvements plan, and other Village policies, chapters, and resolutions by which the Village seeks to ensure the provision of public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. In no event shall a property owner be obligated to pay for capital improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this section; provided, however, that a property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to Village ordinances, regulations, or policies, other fees or for other capital improvements in addition to the impact fees for capital improvements as specified in this chapter.

Stats.   
§ 76-18.  Construal of provisions; severability. 

The provisions of this chapter are hereby found and declared to be in furtherance of the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience, and they shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out their purposes.

If the Administrator determines that the licensee is so operating, the Administrator shall authorize the approval of the economic development grant; provided, however, the grant shall not be paid until the licensed premises, which is the subject of the application, has paid all outstanding fees (including, but not limited to, fines, assessments or taxes) owed the Village of Holmen. If the Administrator determines that the licensee is not in compliance with the approved license, no economic development grant may be authorized and the Administrator shall make such finding in writing and cause to be delivered a copy of the findings to the licensee. If the licensee disagrees with the Administrator's determination, the licensee may file a written notice of appeal upon the Administrator within 10 calendar days of the delivery of the written notice of the Administrator's findings. Upon receiving such notice from the licensee, the Administrator shall relay said notice to the Village Board which shall hold a hearing thereon. The Village Board may affirm or reverse the Administrator's determination. If the Administrator's determination is reversed, the Village Board shall authorize the payment of the economic development grant. 

C.     The Village Administrator is directed to develop the necessary application form and shall monitor the appropriate distribution of the economic development grant funds.

This includes, but is not limited to, interpretation of this chapter.
The Village of Holmen expressly states that it has no responsibility whatsoever for assuring that land and/or buildings sold in the village are in compliance with any ordinances, regulations or rules.

Authority. These regulations are adopted under the authority granted by Section 236.45 of the Wisconsin State Statutes.
Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control the division of land within the corporate limits of the Village of Holmen in order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
Intent. The intent of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community. The regulations are designed to lessen congestion in the highways and streets; to foster the orderly layout and use of land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to discourage overcrowding of the land; to protect the community's agriculture base; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, public water and sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public necessities; and to facilitate the further division of large tracts of land into smaller parcels. The regulations are made with the reasonable consideration of, but not limited to, the present character of the village and its environs, with the objectives of conserving the value of the land and improvements placed thereon, providing the most appropriate environment for human habitation, protecting farming and open spaces, and providing for the most appropriate use of land in the Village of Holmen.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter shall not be construed to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to laws. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
Interpretation.

The rules of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation and the La Crosse County Department of Transportation relating to safety of access and the preservation of the public interest and investment in the highway system if the land owned or controlled by the subdivider abuts on a state or county trunk highway, respectively, or a connecting street, including, but not limited to, minimum width regulations.
All applicable village master plans, as adopted under Section 62.23 of the Wisconsin Statutes, zoning ordinances, official maps, and any other ordinances and regulations.
Improvements.
Development agreement. Before any final plat or certified survey map is approved, the subdivider shall enter into a development agreement with the village wherein the subdivider agrees to install all required improvements within 18 months of the date that the plat or certified survey map is recorded. The Village Board may allow phased construction of plats.
Security required. At the time the development agreement is executed, the subdivider shall file a bond, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit, or certified check, in such form as is acceptable to the Board and approved by the Village Attorney, with the village in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated cost of the required improvements as determined by the Village Engineer. Such deposit shall guarantee that such improvements will be completed according to village specifications by the subdivider or its contractors not later than 18 months from the date that the plat is recorded or, where staging is permitted, that each stage will be completed by the date specified in the installation and completion schedule. Such security shall be held by the village and either released or used in the manner specified in § 90-12. The provision of security by the subdivider shall not release the developer from its obligations under the development agreement nor prejudice the right of the village to recover the full cost of completion of the improvements if the subdivider fails to complete the same.
Governmental units. The State of Wisconsin or La Crosse County may file a resolution duly adopted by such governmental unit agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section.
Construction in phases. The subdivider may elect, with the approval of the Village Board, to install the improvements in phases, provided that:

Erosion control plans and measures submitted and approved shall address the erosion problems posed by the construction of the project in phases.
Reservation and dedication of land.
Public ways. Whenever a tract of land to be divided or subdivided abuts, includes or is adjacent to all or any part of a street, an arterial street, drainageway or other public way which has been designated in any applicable master plan or official map, said public way or street shall be incorporated into the plat and dedicated to the public or to the village by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or map.
Public sites and open spaces.
In designing a land division or subdivision, due consideration shall be given by the developer to the reservation of suitable sites of adequate area for future drainageways, parks, playgrounds, pedestrian and bike paths, and other public purposes. In the location of such facilities, consideration shall be given to the protection and preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of fine trees, marshes, lakes and ponds, water courses, watersheds, wetlands, wildlife habitat and ravines.
All land divisions and subdivision shall be required to dedicate developable land to the village for park, school or other public uses, other than streets or drainageways, at a rate of 0.04 acres (1,742 square feet) per dwelling unit. Whenever a proposed playground, park, or other public area, other than streets or drainageways, designated in the Master Plan or Master Plan component of the Village of Holmen is embraced, all or in part, in the tract of land to be subdivided, these lands shall be made part of the required land dedication. The Village Board, upon the recommendations of the Planning Commission, shall have sole authority to determine the suitability and adequacy of park lands proposed for dedication. Drainageways, wetlands or areas reserved for streets shall not be considered as satisfying land dedication requirements.
Development of parkland. [Amended 6-9-2005 by Ord. No. 3.05; 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 8.06]
When parklands are dedicated, the subdivider is required to:
Properly grade and contour for proper drainage.
Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of the area.
Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of six inches of quality topsoil, seed as specified by the Village Engineer, fertilized with 16-6-6 at a rate of seven pounds per 1,000 square feet and mulched. The topsoil furnished for the park site shall consist of the natural loam, silt loam, silty clay, loam or clay loam humus bearing soils adapted to the substance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one year following issuance of the first building permit within that land division unless otherwise authorized by the Village Engineer. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted until a uniform grass cover to a two-inch height has been established. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to maintain the area until the Village accepts the dedication.
Construct sidewalk on all frontage streets of dedicated parkland. The construction of all sidewalks shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Village Engineer.[4]
Parks.
A neighborhood park area shall be provided by the subdivider with a standard residential water service unless located directly adjacent to a fire hydrant. A neighborhood park area shall be provided by the subdivider with a minimum of one swingset (two regular swings, two infant swings, one handicap swing), one playscape, two slides of various design (may be included with playscape), one shelter (minimum size equal to 825 square feet) construction on concrete pad, one basketball court (minimum size of 40 feet by 40 feet, blacktop surface with markings), including pole, backboard, hoop and net.

The Village Board reserves the right to require additional amenities such as electrical service, lighting, water fountains, fencing, bleachers, benches, shade structures or other amenities as it may deem necessary. The Village Board reserves the right to waive any of the parkland development requirements as stated herein, applying the principle of proportionality where appropriate. The Village Board reserves the right to approve the design and specifications of all amenities prior to construction.
A community park area shall be provided by the developer with a minimum six-inch water service or at least one fire hydrant and at least one four-inch sanitary sewer lateral, all located at the street property line. A community park area shall be provided by the subdivider with a minimum of one swingset (four regular swings, two infant swings, one handicap swing), two playscapes, two slides of various design (may be included with playscape), one enclosed shelter (minimum size equal to 1,000 square feet) construction on concrete pad, one basketball court (minimum size of 70 feet by 40 feet, blacktop surface with markings), including pole, backboard, hoop and net at each end. A tennis court (minimum area of 120 feet by 60 feet), including surface, markings and nets, soccer field (including goals and markers), football field (including goals and markers), baseball field (including bases and backstop) or other park facility or amenity may be required in addition to the required items above. The Village Board reserves the right to require additional amenities such as electrical service, lighting, water fountains, fencing, bleachers, benches, shade structures or other amenities as it may deem necessary. The Village Board reserves the right to waive any of the parkland development requirements as stated herein, applying the principle of proportionality where appropriate. The Village Board reserves the right to approve the design and specifications of all amenities prior to construction.
The Village Board may require certification of compliance by Village officials. The cost of such report shall be paid by the subdivider.
Development of parkland is to be completed as soon as 20% of the planned lots in the subdivision are sold or developed, as determined by the Village Board.
Upon petition by the subdivider, should Village officials agree that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the Board may accept a cash contribution in lieu of parkland dedication in an amount negotiated with subdivider and documented in the subdivider's agreement. The Village Board reserves the right to deny any and all petitions for cash contribution in lieu of parkland dedication. [Amended 10-9-2003 by Ord. No. 6.03; 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 8.06]
The Village shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in a fund which may be used for any park purpose, including land acquisition and development of adequate park, playground, school, recreation and open space to meet the needs created by the land division, subdivision or other development. These funds would not fall under the restrictive provisions that would apply to any impact fees as imposed under Chapter 76, Impact Fees. [Amended 10-14-2004 by Ord. No. 7.04; 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 8.06[5]]
Survey monuments. Before final approval of any plat or certified survey map within the corporate limits of the village, the subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Section 236.15 of the Wisconsin Statutes and as may be required by the Village Engineer. The Village Board may allow deferral of installation of monuments otherwise required under Section 236.15(1)(b), (c) and (d), for a period not to exceed three years on condition that the subdivider execute a surety bond to ensure the placing of such monuments within the time required. [Amended 10-12-2000 by Ord. No. 1.00]
Land suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is deemed by the Village Board, with the advice of the Planning Commission, to be not readily developable. The Village may determine, subject to the provisions of Ch. 236, that lands should not be platted for the reason that the land is zoned improperly, has unsuitable soils, is located on slopes in excess of 12%, is located in a floodplain, shoreland or wetland, or is proposed to be used in a manner contrary to the land use plan of the Village. It is the intent of the Village that paramount consideration be given to the need to preserve prime agricultural land, particularly land which has been zoned exclusive agricultural. Consideration should also be given to adjacent land uses which will be affected by the proposed plat. [Amended 11-9-2006 by Ord. No. 8.06]
Violations. It shall be unlawful to build upon, divide, convey, record or monument or extract minerals from any land in violation of this chapter or of the Wisconsin Statutes; and no person, partnership, firm, corporation, or entity of any sort shall be issued a building permit by the Village of Holmen, authorizing the building on, or improvement of, any land division, subdivision or replat within the jurisdiction of this chapter not of record as of the effective date of this chapter until the provisions and requirements of this chapter have been fully met. The village may institute appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin violations of this chapter or the applicable Wisconsin Statutes. The village may issue citations for violations of the provisions of this chapter.
Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 plus all applicable assessments and the costs of prosecution of each violation. Each day a violation exists or continues shall constitute a separate offense.
Appeals.
If the Village Planning Commission was acting at the request of the Village Board, the following decisions of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Village Board:
Rejection of a preliminary plat;
Rejection of a final plat;
Rejection of a certified survey map;
Requirement of a preliminary plat in connection with a land division;
Determination that land is unsuitable for subdivision.
A written notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within 14 calendar days of the date when notice of the action of the Planning Commission appealed from is mailed to the subdivider.
The notice of appeal shall state the action of the Planning Commission appealed from, shall specify the reasons stated by the Planning Commission for taking such actions, shall specify the reasons why the subdivider believes said action was inappropriate, and shall state the names and addresses of the owners of all properties adjacent to the proposed land division or subdivision.
The Clerk shall file the notice of appeal with the Board and shall schedule the appeal for consideration by the Board at a meeting, open to the public, within 45 days of the filing of the notice of appeal. The Clerk shall send notice of the time scheduled for the consideration of the appeal to the subdivider and to all property owners adjacent to the proposed land division or subdivision at least 10 days prior to the hearing of the appeal.
Within 30 days of the appeal hearing, the Board shall affirm, modify, or reverse the action of the Planning Commission or shall refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further consideration. Notice of the decision of the Board shall be sent to the subdivider and the Planning Commission.
The provisions of Chapter 68 of the Wisconsin Statutes shall not be applicable to any determination made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
Any person aggrieved by an objection to a plat or a failure to approve a plat may, after review by the Board, appeal therefrom, as provided in Sections 236.13(5) and 62.23(7)(e)10 to 15 of the Wisconsin Statutes.     
§ 90-5.  Procedure.
Preapplication. It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a certified survey map or a preliminary plat, the subdivider consult with the Village Board and Planning Commission to obtain its advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, any applicable master plans and plan implementation devices and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning the development. No such consultations shall in any manner bind the Village Planning Commission or the Village Board to approve a plat, a subdivision or any other land use control. Further, no subdivider may rely upon or cite any advice or information provided by the Village Planning Commission or Village Board as evidence of the official actions of the village.
Preliminary plat review.
Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and a written application for approval. The preliminary plat shall include the entire area owned or controlled by the subdivider even though only a portion thereof is proposed for development at the time. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. The subdivider shall file 10 copies of the plat and the application with the Clerk at least 21 days prior to the meeting of the Village Planning Commission at which action is desired. The subdivider shall also submit 10 copies of the subdivision check list. The Village Planning Commission may waive the requirement that the preliminary plat include the entire area owned by the developer where it is unnecessary to fulfill the purpose of the ordinance and undue hardship would result from strict enforcement of this provision. Where a subdivider has control of lands which are equal to or in excess of 80 acres in area, or are smaller parcels separated only by existing public roads, in lieu of a preliminary plat on the entire area, the developer may elect to submit a comprehensive development plan.
The Clerk shall forward five copies of the preliminary plat to the Village Planning Commission which shall examine it for conformity with all ordinances, administrative rules and regulations and for compliance with any applicable village master plan.
The Village Planning Commission shall recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the proposed plat to the Village Board. If approval or conditional approval is recommended, the preliminary plat shall be referred to the Board for consideration. The Village Board shall then approve, conditionally approve, or reject the preliminary plat. One copy of the plat shall be returned to the subdivider, the developer's surveyor, or engineer with the date and action endorsed thereon. If the plat is approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the Board, failure to complete the action therein required within 90 days of filing of the preliminary plat constitutes an approval of the preliminary plat.
Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat entitles the final plat to approval provided the final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary plat, including any conditions of that approval, and conforms to any applicable village plans and applicable ordinances. If the final plat is not submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat, any approving authority may refuse to approve the final plat regardless of prior action taken on the preliminary plat.
Final plat review.
The subdivider shall prepare and file six copies of the final plat together with a written application for approval with the Clerk within six months of the approval of the preliminary plat and at least 14 days prior to the meeting of the Village Board at which action is desired.
The Clerk shall forward two copies of the plat to the Village Board and the Planning Commission. The Village Board and Planning Commission shall examine it for conformity with the preliminary plat and any conditions or approval, with the requirements of this chapter, and with the requirements of any other ordinances, statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or local plans which may be applicable to it. The Planning Commission shall recommend to the Village Board approval or rejection. The Planning Commission shall list the conditions or requirements of approval or reasons for rejection.
The Village Board shall approve or shall reject the plat. The Village Board shall indicate the reasons for any rejection of the plat. One copy of the plat shall then be returned to the subdivider, the surveyor, or engineer with the date and action endorsed thereon, and if approved or rejected, the conditions or requirements of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the Board, failure to complete the action required herein within 60 days of filing the final plat shall constitute an approval of the final plat.
The final plat may, if permitted by the Village Board, include only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record at this time.
The final plat shall be approved if it conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any conditions of that approval, and to any applicable village plans and ordinances. If the final plat is not submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission may reject the final plat regardless of any prior action on the preliminary plat.
After the final plat has been approved by the Board and the contract and security filed in accordance with § 90-4C(2) hereof, the subdivider shall submit the final plat to the Clerk. The Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to such approval to be duly executed. The plat shall be returned to the subdivider for recording.
The subdivider shall file a certified copy of the final plat with the Clerk within 10 days after it has been recorded.
Land division by certified survey.
A certified survey map which has been approved by the Village Planning Commission and the Village Board, and meets all of the requirements of Section 236.34 of the Wisconsin Statutes and of this chapter, may be utilized to create not more than one new parcel or building site. The Village Board may require a preliminary plat to be filed by a subdivider who is seeking approval of a certified survey map. When required, the preliminary plat must include all lands under the control of the applicant within a parcel up to a maximum area of 40 acres. The land included within the 40 acres shall be defined by quarter-quarter section lines unless indicated otherwise. When a preliminary plat is not required, the certified survey map shall include the entire parcel owned by the subdivider. The Board resolution approving the certified survey map shall be reproduced legibly on the face of the certified survey map. All unpaid or outstanding taxes, assessments and special assessments shall be paid prior to the approval unless determined otherwise by the Village Board.
An applicant for a land division shall file 10 copies of the certified survey map and a written application for approval with the Clerk. An applicant shall submit 10 copies of the certified survey checklist. The certified survey map must be prepared in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
The Village Board shall within 60 days approve, approve conditionally, or reject the certified survey map based on a determination of conformance with the provisions of this chapter. One copy of the certified survey map shall be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the Board, failure to complete the action required herein within 60 days of the filing of the map shall constitute an approval of the certified survey map.
After the certified survey map has been approved by the Village Board, the development agreement has been executed and recorded, the security filed in accordance with § 90-4C and any fee imposed pursuant to § 90-4D(2) has been paid, the subdivider shall submit the certified survey map to the Clerk. The Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the map attesting to such approval to be duly executed. The certified survey map shall be returned to the subdivider for recording.
The subdivider shall record the certified survey map with the Register of Deeds for La Crosse County after it has been approved, and shall file a certified copy of the recorded map with the Clerk within 10 days after the certified survey map is recorded.     
§ 90-6.  Preliminary plat.
General. A preliminary plat shall be required for all subdivisions and shall be based on a survey by a land surveyor registered in this state.

§ 90-9.  Design standards.
Street arrangement. In any new subdivision the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location indicated on any official map, master plan or component neighborhood development plan of the village. In areas for which plans have not been completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. Each lot of the subdivision or land division shall have access to a public street which is, at a minimum, sufficient to allow ingress and egress of motor vehicles.
Arterial streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they connect.
Collector streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches, shopping centers and other concentrations of population, and to the major streets into which they feed.
Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property.
Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. Temporary turnarounds shall be required where the street ends at the boundary of the subdivision. The road right-of-way shall continue to the adjacent lands and connect to roads constructed on such lands if approved by the Village Board.
Arterial and highway protection. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a major highway, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen plantings contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or by the use of frontage streets.
Reserve strips controlling access to roads or highways are prohibited except where control of such strips is placed with the village under conditions approved by the Village Board. 
Street names and numbering.
Street names shall be assigned in accordance with the provisions of village ordinances.
The following designations shall be used only in the situations indicated:
Lane: a street, one block long, not ending in a cul-de-sac.
Circle: a cul-de-sac of nine lots or more.
Court: a cul-de-sac of eight lots or less.
Limited access highway rights-of-way. Whenever the proposed subdivision or land division contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway the design shall provide the following treatment:
In residential districts a buffer strip at least 30 feet of depth, in addition to the normal lot depth required, shall be provided adjacent to a limited access arterial highway or restricted by the right-of-way plat or County Highway Department. As used in this section, the term "buffer strip" means an area of hedges, trees, tall grasses or other foliage which creates a visual screen between two areas. The lot depth required, including such buffer strip, shall not be less than 150 feet. The strip shall be a part of the platted lots, but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures hereon is prohibited, and the rear 30 feet of the strip shall not be counted as any required yard. Maintenance of this strip is a responsibility of the lot owner."
Commercial and manufacturing districts shall have, on each side of the limited access highway, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway for the appropriate use of the land between such highway and street, but not less than 150 feet.[6]
Streets parallel to a limited access highway shall, when intersecting a major street or highway which crosses said highway, be located at a minimum distance of 300 feet from said highway. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. No local streets intersecting a collector street from opposite direction shall be closer than 300 feet from the right-of-way line.
Location of local streets in residential areas immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways shall be avoided.
Street design standards.
Minimum right-of-way. The minimum right-of-way for all proposed streets and roads shall be 60 feet or such other width as is specified by the Village Master Plan, Official Map, Neighborhood Development Study or Appendix A.[7]
Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac street ends are prohibited unless authorized by a variance granted by the Village Board. No variance shall be granted unless the Village Board finds, after hearing, that use of cul-de-sac street ends is necessary to overcome limitations imposed by the physical characteristics of the land, so that development may occur which is consistent with the policies stated in this chapter. If the Village Board grants a variance, the cul-de-sac shall conform to the following standards:
Streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not exceed 600 feet in length.
Streets which are designed to have one end permanently closed shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way diameter of 110 feet, and a minimum paved diameter of 80 feet. The reverse curve on a cul-de-sac right-of-way shall have a thirty-foot minimum radius when the bulb is centered on the street and sixty-foot minimum radius when the bulb is offset.
In areas zoned B-1, B-2, Manufacturing or other commercial zones, all streets which are designed to have one end permanently closed, shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way of 175 feet, and a minimum paved diameter of 120 feet.
Street grades and radii of curvature. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography and subject to the approval of the Village Engineer, the street grades and radii of curvature shall conform to the Design Standard in Appendix A.[8]
Blocks.
The widths, lengths and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land; zoning requirements; stormwater management; need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic; and the limitations and opportunities of topography.
Blocks in residential areas shall not be less than 500 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length unless otherwise dictated by exceptional topography or other limiting design factors.[9]
Width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic. Width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area zoning restrictions for such use.
Lots.
The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the buildings contemplated.
No lot may have frontage on streets on two parallel sides nor may a lot be platted so that the building will face the reverse side of the lot. The Village Board may grant a variance from this requirement where necessary, the physical characteristics of the land so require in order to provide separation of residential development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
Residential lots to be served by private sewage disposal facilities shall comply with the rules of the Wisconsin Department of Commerce and La Crosse County Sanitary Code.
Lots must front on and have access to a state or county highway or approved village road. Every lot shall front or abut on a public street or road for a distance of at least 60 feet.
Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines.
Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them.
Corner lots shall have sufficient width to permit adequate building setbacks from side streets.
Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.
Whenever a tract is subdivided into large parcels, such parcels shall be arranged and dimensioned as to allow resubdivision of any such parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise unplantable lands which lie between proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots, or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream.
Easements.
Lines to be underground in newly platted areas.
All new electric distribution lines (excluding lines of 12,000 volts or more), all new telephone lines from which lots are individually served, all cable television and all other common carrier services installed within a newly platted area shall be underground unless the Village Board shall specifically find after study that:
The placing of such facilities under ground would not be compatible with the planned development;
Location, topography, soil, water table, solid rock, boulders, stands of trees, hedges or other physical conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impracticable; or
The lots to be served by said facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities.
Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric and communications systems, such as but not limited to substations, pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches and above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes may be located above ground.
Easement conditions. The subdivider shall include appropriate easements on the final plat. Easements shall be for the installation of gas, electric and communication lines. Such easements as shall be noted as "Utility Easements" on the final plat or certified survey map. Prior to approval of the final plat or certified survey map, the concurrence of the electric and communications companies serving the area as to the location and width of the utility easements shall be documented and given to the village.
Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, an adequate drainageway or easement shall be provided as required by the Village Board. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway or easement shall be subject to the approval of the Village Board. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. Wherever possible, the stormwater drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels or storm sewers of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow, these sizes and design details to be subject to review and approval by the Village Engineer and Village Board. Drainage easements shall substantially maintain existing water flow patterns onto neighboring lands.     
§ 90-10.  Required improvements.
Streets and street lights. Standard street improvements including street lights shall be installed in accordance with State of Wisconsin Electric Code.

The subdivider shall pay for the construction of a sidewalk on one side of all frontage streets and both sides of all other streets within the subdivision. Sidewalks will be installed within five years after the final plat is approved. The sidewalks shall be constructed when the principal building on the parcel is built, but not to exceed five years after the final plat is approved. Covenants with the subdivision shall include the requirements for the installation of sidewalks. The construction of all sidewalks shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Engineer.
Wider than standard sidewalks may be required by the Engineer in the vicinity of schools, commercial area and other places of public assemblage; and the Planning Commission may require the construction of sidewalks in locations other than required under the preceding provisions of this chapter if such walks are necessary, in its opinion, for safe and adequate pedestrian circulation.
A multi-use trail may be used in place of a sidewalk if indicated in an adopted master plan or neighborhood development plan.
Bike lanes are required if and as indicated in an adopted master plan or neighborhood development plan.
Central sanitary sewage and private sewage disposal systems.
The subdivider shall pay for the construction of sanitary sewers in such a manner as to make adequate sanitary sewerage service available to each lot within the subdivision. If central sewer facilities are not available, the subdivider shall make provision for adequate private sewage disposal systems as specified by the village, the Department of Commerce and the County Sanitarian. The sewage disposal systems shall be certified by the County Sanitarian prior to final plat approval. The specified private sewage disposal systems shall include systems utilizing a septic field and may include mound type systems. The Planning Commission shall require the installation of sewer laterals to the street lot line. If, at the time of final platting, sanitary sewer facilities are not available to the plat, but will become available within a period of five years from the date of plat recording, the subdivider shall cause to be installed sanitary sewers and sewer lateral to the street lot line in accordance with this section and shall cap all laterals as may be specified by the Engineer.
The size, type, and installation of all sanitary sewers proposed to be constructed shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the Engineer.
The subdivider shall assume the cost of installing all sanitary sewers eight inches in diameter or less in size. If greater than eight-inch-diameter sewers are required to handle the contemplated sewage flows, the cost of such larger sewers shall be prorated in proportion to the ratio which the total area of the proposed plat is to the total drainage area to be served by such larger sewer and the excess cost either borne by the community or assessed against the total tributary drainage area.
Stormwater drainage facilities. The subdivider shall pay for the cost to install stormwater drainage facilities, which may include catch basins and inlets, storm sewers, road ditches and open channels, and the cost to install curbs and gutters, as may be required. All such facilities are to be of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow; the type of facility required, the design criteria and the sizes and grades to be determined by the developer's engineer. Storm drainage facilities shall be so designed as to present no hazard to life or property; and the size, type and installation of all stormwater drains and sewers proposed to be constructed shall be in accordance with the plans and standard specifications approved by the Village Board.
Central water supply facilities. The subdivider shall pay for the construction of water mains in such a manner as to make adequate water service and fire protection available to each lot within the subdivision. Any additional oversizing required by the village will be borne by the community. If municipal water service is not available, the subdivider shall make provision for adequate private water systems as specified by the Village Board and the State Department of Natural Resources and the County Sanitarian.

[Amended 10-12-2000 by Ord. No. 1.00]
Plans indicating the proposed location of all gas, electrical power and telephone distribution and transmission lines required to service the plat shall be approved by the utility company.
Storm sewer and stormwater drainage facilities. [Amended 8-11-2011 by Ord. No. 4.11]
Storm sewers shall be constructed unless the requirement is waived by the Village Board. The Village Board may waive the requirement only:
If surface stormwater management methods are proposed in a master plan or neighborhood development plan of the Village; or
Upon a showing that the natural drainage pattern of the land being subdivided will be adequate to handle the water flow from the subdivision; and
Upon finding from the Hydraulic and Sedimentation Study for the appropriate watershed that no storm drainage facilities are required.
Ditches or swales shall be constructed whenever storm sewers are not required by the Village Board.
Roadside ditches or swales shall not exceed 12% of grade nor have less than a 1% grade.
Ditches shall be restored with four inches topsoil, fertilizing, seeding and mulching in accordance with the current Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, State of Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
Stormwater facilities intended to provide treatment or infiltration, including swales in the street right-of-way, shall be constructed in accordance with the appropriate State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Conservation Practice Standard.
Where ditches or swales are required, streets shall be constructed in accordance with village standard specifications. The thickness of the pavement shall be determined and prescribed by the Village Engineer in accordance with Appendix A.[10] Any soil subgrade data required by the Village Engineer shall be obtained by the developer's soils engineer and furnished to the Village Engineer without cost.    
Partition fences. When the land included in the plat or certified survey map abuts upon or is adjacent to land used for farming or grazing purposes, the Village Board may require the developer to erect, keep and maintain partition fences, satisfying the requirements of the Wisconsin Statutes for a legal and sufficient fence, between such land and the adjacent land. A covenant binding the developer, its grantees, heirs, successors, and assignees to erect and maintain such fences, without cost to the adjoining property owners, so long as the land is used for farming or grazing purposes shall be included upon the face of the final plat or certified survey map. [Amended 10-13-2005 by Ord. No. 7.05]
Driveways.
Approval required. No person shall establish or construct a private driveway, road or other access from a private property line to the traveled portion of any public village road without first filing an application and obtaining a driveway permit from the Village Clerk. In the case of a property fronting on a county or state trunk highway, said permit must be obtained through the La Crosse County Highway Department. All driveways shall be constructed at sidewalk grade.
Sign costs. The developer shall be responsible for the initial cost of the street/road name signs and traffic control for new streets. The village will order and install the signs after construction of the subdivision streets. The developer will be billed for the cost and installation. Payment will be required prior to issuing any building permits.
Waiver.
Where, in the judgment of the Village Board, it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of this § 90-10 to a land division because extraordinary or undue hardship resulting from the characteristics of the land would result, the Village Board may waive or modify any requirement, other than requirements of state law or the recording of the certified survey map or plat map, and only to the extent a waiver is found to be just and proper.
The Village Board shall grant such relief only where it will not be detrimental to the public good, impair the intent and purpose of this chapter, or impair the desirable general development of the community in accordance with the master plan.
Any subdivider who requests a waiver of a provision of this § 90-10 shall make a written application for a waiver and file the application with the Village Clerk. The Village Board shall hold a public hearing on the application not less than 40 days after it is filed. The Village Clerk shall mail a notice of the hearing to all adjacent landowners. The waiver application shall state the basis for the application and the specific hardship which is claimed to exist.
Any waiver, exception, or variance which is granted pursuant to this section shall be made in writing, shall state the reasons which justified its issuance and shall be filed with the Village Clerk.[11]     
§ 90-11.  Required improvements procedure.
Plans and construction specifications. Prior to commencing construction of any required improvement, the subdivider shall prepare construction plans and specifications and submit them to the Village Engineer or designee for review and approval. The Village Engineer may require the submission of the following plans and accompanying construction specifications before authorizing construction or installation of the improvements:
Street plans and profiles showing existing and proposed grades, elevations and cross sections of required improvements.
Stormwater and surface water drainage plans.
Such additional plans or information as may be required by the Village Engineer.
Plans and specification for all utilities and underground facilities.
Private contracts. The developer shall engage one general contractor whose qualifications have been approved by the Board for each major phase of construction (grading, utilities, streets) or one general contractor for a contract which includes more than one phase of construction.
Scheduling. All scheduling of the contemplated improvements shall be approved by the Village Engineer. Construction may not be commenced on any phase of construction until all approvals and conditional requirements are satisfied and a copy of the private contract has been filed with and approved by the Board. Construction shall not proceed until all State of Wisconsin approvals are granted.
Street grading.
The developer shall furnish standard drawings which indicate the existing and proposed grades of streets shown on the plat, and after review of design engineering work on the streets by the Village Engineer and approval of street grades by the Board, the subdivider shall grade or cause to be graded the full width of the right-of-way of the streets proposed to be dedicated, including the vision clearance triangle on corner lots. In those cases where existing street right-of-way is made a part of the subdivider's plat or abuts the plat, the subdivider shall grade or cause to be graded that portion of the right-of-way between the existing pavement and the property line. The bed for the roadways in the street right-of-way shall be graded to subgrade elevation. The Village Engineer shall inspect the proposed street before grading and approve all grading within the right-of-way. The street grading shall extend for a sufficient distance beyond the right-of-way to ensure that the established grade will be preserved. The grading of rights-of-way for principal and primary arterials shall only be required where necessary to provide access to the streets or lots in the plat.
The developer shall engage a licensed professional engineer to set subbase grade in accordance with approved center line grade and cross section; and to set grades necessary to comply with other grading requirements, including vision clearance on corner lots, center line and lot line grades for greenways, terrace grading for abutting streets and other required grades. The grading program shall consist of the following elements: 
The stripping and removal of all topsoil, debris and vegetation within the street right-of-way.
Grading of full street right-of-way to a tolerance of zero to 0.2 feet below proposed center line grade. Fill sections shall be constructed of approved materials, which do not include topsoil, debris, vegetation, etc.
Grading beyond right-of-way to ensure that the established grade will be preserved. 
Grading of vision triangles on corner lots shall be done such that no embankment within a vision triangle exists at a height greater than two feet above the highest proposed top of curb elevation adjacent to the lot. The limits of vision triangles shall be as established in code § 195-8F(4). Any objects proposed to be located within such vision triangles must conform with the requirements listed in § 195-8F(4). [Amended 7-13-2006 by Ord. No. 7.06]
Where the public greenway is included in the plat, the developer is responsible for an acceptable continuous drainageway in the greenway as determined by the Village Engineer.
All additional plat grading, where applicable, lot abutting greenways, terraces of streets abutting plats public easements for sanitary sewer and sidewalk, and other requirements of ordinances and special conditions of plat approval. There shall be a plan for disposal of any surplus soil or earth.
Utilities.
If the developer elects to install underground utilities and the standard street improvement in the same year, provision must be made for mechanical compaction of all ditches for underground utilities that fall within the street right-of-way.
Prior to commencing construction of any required utilities, the developer shall submit the proposed construction schedule, plans, specifications and contract to the Village Engineer.
Greenways. Greenways included within platted or replatted area shall receive the following prescribed treatment by the owner of the subdivision.
The subdivider shall be responsible for an acceptable continuous drainageway through the proposed plat as determined by the Village Engineer. The subdivider shall furnish the Village Engineer a plan outlining the greenway boundaries and location of existing drainageways, if any. In addition, the subdivider shall furnish to the Village Engineer a set of cross-sections (on 50 feet stations) of the greenway oriented upon a base line as prescribed by the Village Engineer. Where a natural drainageway exists which has acceptable hydraulic capacities including alignment and grade as determined by the Village Engineer, construction will not be required and the existing natural growth shall be preserved. When such natural growth is not preserved by action of the subdivider or an acting agent, the subdivider shall be responsible for repairing the disturbed areas by sodding. However, in certain locations, as determined by the Village Engineer, where the hydraulic capacities including alignment and grade are not acceptable, then such alignment, grade and slopes shall be improved by the subdivider to the interim minimum requirements of a ten-foot-wide ditch bottom with four to one side slopes, all to be seeded.
The subdivider shall install permanent pipes, culverts or bridge at a grade designated by the Village Engineer under all streets crossing a greenway or drainageway. Said installation shall be in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction of the Department of Transportation of the State of Wisconsin. All costs of the installation shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. The permanent pipe or culvert shall not be installed prior to the installation of a street crossing a greenway unless done pursuant to written agreement between the Engineer and the subdivider. Culverts required across intersections for temporary street drainage, shall be furnished and installed by the developer at the developer's expense. All temporary culverts installed by the developer shall be completely removed when the streets are constructed to standards and the area restored to as near to original condition as possible as determined by the Village Engineer.
The Village Engineer shall inspect the property prior to and after the installation of utilities.
All ditching and culvert installation shall be done in strict accordance with grades approved by the Engineer. The subdivider's engineer shall be responsible for setting all required grades in the field for construction purposes.
In order to assure proper drainage, the ground elevation along any lot line common with the boundary of a greenway shall not be less than four feet above the flowline of the greenway, or where designated to an elevation established by the Engineer, prior to the sale of affected properties. The flowline grade shall be established by the Engineer. All lot grading and building elevations shall provide for positive drainage. Grading or filling within the greenway limit is prohibited except as authorized by the Engineer. The Village Engineer shall inspect all work before it is certified as complete.
Street construction.
General. After completion of the underground utilities and approval thereof, the streets shall be constructed.
Standard street improvements.

The developer shall prepare final plans and specifications for the standard street improvements and submit them, together with all soil subgrade data obtained by its soils engineer, to the Village Engineer.
Upon written approval by the Village Engineer, the developer may proceed to construct the standard street improvements. Standard street improvements shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision unless the street culminates in a cul-de-sac, the topography or other physical conditions make it impossible to do so, or unless this requirement is waived, in writing, by the Village Board.
The street/road shall be constructed to village specifications as described in Appendix A.[12]
Inspection of street improvements. The Village Engineer shall inspect all street improvements before the same are accepted by the village.
Change orders. When extra work not specified in the contract is required to complete the project, the village will notify the developer or the engineering representative. No extra work shall proceed until the developer or the representative has entered into a written agreement for the additional work.
Erosion control. The subdivider shall take all steps necessary to prevent the erosion, siltation, sedimentation, washing and blowing of dirt and debris caused by grading, excavations, open cuts, side slopes, and other activities by the subdivider or the contractors. Reasonable methods of control shall include, but not be limited to, seeding and mulching, sodding, berm construction, pond construction, and watering as prescribed in the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Handbook. In such cases where the method of control has failed, the subdivider shall clean up the materials which have been displaced prior to construction of additional improvements. Plans for erosion control shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for review and approval before any land surface disturbances are made.
Floodplain/shoreland. All provisions of village ordinances relating to floodplain and shoreland zoning are incorporated herein and adopted by reference.
Inspection. Prior to commencing any work within the subdivision, the subdivider shall make arrangements with the Village Engineer to provide for adequate inspection. The Village Engineer shall inspect and approve all completed work prior to approval of the final plat or any release of the securities deposited pursuant to § 90-4C.   
§ 90-12.  Acceptance of improvements.
After the subdivider has installed all required improvements, the subdivider shall notify the Village Engineer in writing that the work is complete and ready for final inspection. The Village Engineer shall inspect the improvements and forward a letter to the subdivider indicating the Village Engineer's approval or disapproval. When the improvements have been approved by the Village Engineer, the Clerk will prepare a final billing for engineering, inspection and legal fees and submit it to the subdivider for payment. In addition, the subdivider and all general contractors shall file lien waivers or affidavits, in a form acceptable to the village and approved by the Village Attorney, evidencing that there are no claims, actions or demands for damages, based upon contract or tort arising out of or in any way related to the project and that no moneys are owed to any surveyor, mechanic, subcontractor, material supplier or laborer.
Resolution. When the engineering, inspection, and legal fees have been paid and when the necessary lien waivers and affidavits have been filed, a resolution accepting the project will be prepared and presented to the Village Board.
Security release. The security furnished pursuant to § 90-4C shall remain in full force for a minimum guarantee period of three years, or for a period as established in the developers agreement, whichever is greater, after the completion of the project and acceptance by the Board unless partially released as hereinafter provided. The security shall be held to guarantee the work performed pursuant to private contracts against defects in workmanship and materials. If any defect appears during the period of the guarantee, the subdivider or its contractor shall, at its expense, install replacements or perform acceptable repairs. In the event that the subdivider fails to install the replacement or perform the repairs, the Village may do so and deduct the cost thereof from the security deposit.

§ 90-15.  Fees.
General. The subdivider shall pay the village all fees as hereinafter required and at the times specified.
Preliminary plat and certified survey review fee. [Amended 1-13-2005 by Ord. No. 9.04]
The subdivider shall pay a flat fee plus a fee for each lot or parcel within the preliminary plat to the Treasurer at the time the application or reapplication is made for approval of any preliminary plat. The fees imposed shall be set annually by the Village Board.
The subdivider shall pay a flat fee plus a fee for each lot or parcel to the Treasurer at the time the application is made for a certified survey map. The fees imposed shall be set annually by the Village Board.
Engineering, inspection and attorney fees.
The subdivider shall pay all engineering, inspection, consulting and legal fees incurred by the village for services performed by or on behalf of the village in conjunction with the design, inspection and review of any preliminary plat, certified survey, final plat, comprehensive development plan, or contract, with the drafting of legal documents, and with such inspections as the Village Engineer deems necessary to assure that the construction of the required improvements is in compliance with the plans, specifications and ordinances of the village or any other governmental authority. Consulting, engineering, inspection and legal fees shall be the actual costs to the village on the basis of submitted invoices plus twice (2x) the actual payroll costs for time spent by any employees of the village. Such fees may be billed monthly, or upon completion of the project as determined by the Board.
To guarantee payment of the engineering, inspection and attorneys fees, the subdivider shall deposit the sum of $1,000 with the Village Clerk at the time that the application for approval is first filed. If such fees are paid timely, the deposit will be refunded at the time that the final plat is approved by the Village Board or 30 days after the preliminary plat or final plat is rejected. In the event that the subdivider fails to pay such fees within 14 days of the time when the village submits its bill therefor, the village may deduct the amount of such fees from the security deposit.     
§ 90-16.  Review, approval and denial of extraterritorial plats and certified survey maps. [Added 2-14-2008 by Ord. No. 2.08]
When it is proposed to divide lands located in the unincorporated area within 1 1/2 miles of the corporate limits of the Village of Holmen, the subdivider shall proceed as specified in § 90-5 through § 90-8 of this chapter, and entirely subject to the following: The Village of Holmen strongly advocates the preservation of agricultural lands, the rural character of large open spaces, natural resource preservation, bluffland preservation and restricted residential development, particularly where municipal sewer and water services are unlikely to be available. Land divisions proposed in the Village's extraterritorial planning area to accommodate new residential, commercial, and other nonagricultural uses, or that have the effect of destroying or limiting the economic viability of agricultural operations are prohibited, as they result in sprawling development patterns in rural spaces and farm areas surrounding the Village in conflict with the Village of Holmen Comprehensive Plan. Such uses unlikely to be served by public sanitary sewer and public water service pose severe restrictions on Village and County efforts to create and plan for orderly development and will contribute to a diminishment of water quality in the region. Exceptions may be considered for remnant lots when created for the benefit of any city, town, village, school district, or any agency or instrumentality of the state, for public use. Conditional exceptions may also be considered when a documented, factual hardship is found to exist for a property owner if a proposed land division were to be denied.
Specific criteria for review (approval/denial) of preliminary extraterritorial land divisions, as provided below, must be considered. The proposal may be denied if any of the following result:
Specific criteria -agricultural land division. Does the proposal:
Reduce or diminish the continuation of viable or economically significant agricultural land use of the property?
Adversely impact or create incompatible uses in relation to neighboring farm operations?
Limit views, reduce potential access to natural resources, or in other ways diminish the quality of open space or rural character of the property?
Have the effect of circumventing, restricting or blocking planned land uses or other elements of the Village of Holmen's Comprehensive Plan, including Official Map elements?
While not changing use or zoning, have the effect of undermining the long-term sustainability of existing farm operations?
Specific criteria -single-family non-farm residences. Does the proposal:
Suggest privately sewered residential development on soils that place limitations on basement construction and septic field absorption?
Suggest development on land where the property may be adversely affected by high groundwater or periodic flooding?
Suggest development on land that exceeds 12% slope?
Specific criteria -commercial/industrial. Does the proposal:
Fail to arrange for obtaining the full range of urban services? Businesses requiring significant water resources, large septic facilities, or require fire protection supported by a public system with hydrants should be directed to the Village.
Fail to address a broad public interest such as resource conservation or development of transportation-related facilities where there is a demonstrable public benefit or need?
Fail to identify intended development of limited rural businesses that are supportive of agricultural uses?
Specific criteria -mineral extraction. Land division to accommodate mineral extraction within the Village extraterritorial jurisdiction may not be approved unless:
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the site does not impair the uses, values, and enjoyment of other property in close proximity.
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the site shall not diminish or endanger public health, safety, comfort or general welfare.
The location of the site shall not impede the normal and orderly development of permitted uses on surrounding property.
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the site shall not diminish the scenic or environmental value of area blufflands.
A reclamation plan shall be submitted to the Village and approved for the site. The Village Plan Commission shall require all requests for review of preliminary extraterritorial land division proposals to meet the pre-application and submittal process requirements as identified in this chapter.
Specific criteria -Village of Holmen Comprehensive Plan. Is the proposal:
Consistent with the Village of Holmen Comprehensive Plan?
In the event the provisions of this chapter are in direct conflict with the provisions of the Village of Holmen Comprehensive Plan, the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan shall prevail.
Where more than one governing body or other agency has authority to approve or to object to a plat or certified survey map and the requirements of such bodies or agencies are conflicting, the plat or certified survey map shall comply with the most restrictive requirement.
Transmittal responsibility. The proposing subdivider shall be responsible for transmitting copies of the plat or map proposing any land division within the Village's extraterritorial plat jurisdiction to the designated planning and reviewing agencies of the affected Town, Village of Holmen and La Crosse County. The subdivider shall confirm in his letter of application to the Village that such transmittals have taken place.

§ 95-1.  Vagrancy and loitering prohibited.  [Amended 6-10-1993[1]]
No person shall loiter or loaf about public buildings, places or premises or wander about the streets, alleys, parks or other public places either by day or night, whose actions give rise to a suspicion of wrongdoing and who is unable to give a satisfactory account of himself, or who, having the physical ability to work, is without any visible means of support and does not seek employment, or who derives part of his support from begging, prostitution, pandering, fortune telling or as a similar impostor.
No person shall loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a police or peace officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a police or peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this subsection, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if the police or peace officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if believed by the police or peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.  
§ 95-2.  Obstructing streets and sidewalks prohibited.
No person shall stand, sit, loaf or loiter or engage in any sport or exercise on any public street, sidewalk, bridge or public ground within the Village of Holmen in such manner as to prevent or hinder, obstruct the free passage of pedestrian or vehicular traffic thereon or to prevent or hinder free ingress or egress to or from any place of business or amusement, church, public hall or meeting place.

§ 95-3.  Violations and penalties.
Any person under the age of 18 years violating the provisions of § 95-1 hereof may be referred to the proper juvenile authorities, as provided in Chapter 48 of the Wisconsin Statutes, and in the case of repeated violations by the same person both the person and the parents or legal guardian of such person shall be referred to the juvenile authorities.
Any person of 18 years or older violating §§ 95-1 and 95-2 hereof shall forfeit to the Village of Holmen the sum of not less than $50 or more than $500 for the first offense and not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for a subsequent offense, and the costs of prosecution, and in case of default of payment of such forfeiture and costs, shall be imprisoned in the County jail until payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution but not exceeding 30 days for each violation.

It shall be unlawful for any parent, guardian or other person having the lawful care, custody and control of any person under 18 years of age to allow or permit such person to violate the provisions of § 101-1 above. The fact that prior to the present offense a parent, guardian or custodian was informed by any law enforcement officer of the separate violation of this article occurring within 30 days of the present offense shall be prima facie evidence that such parent, guardian or custodian allowed or permitted the present violation.

§ 101-3.  Responsibility of place of amusement.

It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or organization operating or in charge of any place of amusement, entertainment, refreshment or other place of business to permit any minor under 18 years of age to loiter, loaf or idle in such place during the hours prohibited by this article. Whenever the owner or person in charge or in control of any place of amusement, entertainment, refreshment or other place of business during the hours prohibited by this article shall find persons under 18 years of age loitering, loafing or idling in such place of business, he shall immediately order such person to leave and if such person refuses to leave said place of business, the operator shall immediately notify the Police Department and inform them of the violation. 

§ 101-4.  Detaining a minor.

Every law enforcement officer is hereby authorized to detain any minor violating the provisions of the above until such time as the parent, guardian or person having legal custody of the minor shall be immediately notified and the person so notified shall as soon as reasonably possible thereafter report to the Police Department for the purpose of taking the custody of the minor and shall sign the release for him or her. If no response is received, the police shall take whatever action is deemed necessary in the best interest of the minor. 

§ 101-5.  Violations and penalties. [Amended 5-11-2006 by Ord. No. 5.06] 

Any parent, guardian or person having legal custody of a child described in §§ 101-1 through 101-4 who has been warned and who thereafter violates any of the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $50 nor more than $500 for the first offense and not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for a subsequent offense. After a second violation within a six-month period, if the defendant, in a prosecution under this article, proves that he or she is unable to comply with this article because of the disobedience of the child, the action shall be dismissed and the child shall be referred to the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under Chapter 48, Wis. Stats. 
Any minor person under 18 years of age who shall violate this article shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $50 nor more than $500 for the first offense and not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for a subsequent offense.

The policing of the parade will require so large a number of persons and vehicles, including ambulances, as to prevent adequate service of the needs of the rest of the municipality; or

The conduct of the parade will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; or
The parade is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in aggressive or destructive activity.  
§ 119-11.  Grant or denial of permit.
Time when required.

§ 119-13.  Governing body may overrule Clerk: revocation.
Nothing herein shall prevent the local elected governing body from overruling the Clerk in granting or denying a permit. The Village President may revoke a permit already issued, if he or she deems that such action is justified by an actual or potential emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace, or by a major change in the conditions forming the basis of the standards of issuance. In lieu of revoking a permit the Village President may require the permittee to file evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in force or other evidence of adequate financial responsibility, running to the Village of Holmen and such third parties as maybe injured or damaged, in an amount depending upon the likelihood of injury or damage as a direct and proximate result of the holding of the parade sufficient to indemnify the municipality and such third parties as may be injured or damaged thereby, caused by the permittee, its agents or participants.

If the application does not contain the information required by Subsection C above.
The application is made less than the required days in advance of the scheduled exclusive use.
If it is for a use of the park or park facility at a date and time when, in addition to the proposed use, anticipated nonexclusive use by others of the park or park facility is expected and would be seriously adversely affected.
If the law enforcement requirements of the exclusive use will require so large a number of persons as to prevent adequate law enforcement to the park, park facility or shelter area involved or of the rest of the Village.
The exclusive use will reasonably create a substantial risk of injury to persons or damage to property.
The exclusive use is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in aggressive or destructive activity.
Indemnification. Prior to granting any permit for exclusive use of the park, the Village may require the permittee to file evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in force or other evidence of adequate financial responsibility, running to the Village and such other third parties as may be injured or damaged, in an amount depending upon the likelihood of injury or damage as a direct and proximate result of the exclusive use sufficient to indemnify the Village and such third parties as may be injured or damaged thereby, caused by the permittee, its agents or participants.
Permit not required for village activity. A permit is not required for exclusive use of the park or a park facility sponsored by the Village.
Permit revocation. The Village Board, Park and Recreation Committee, and or the Chief of Police or his designee(s) after granting a permit may revoke a permit already issued if it is deemed that the terms of the permit are not being complied with, or that such action is justified by an actual or potential emergency due to weather, fire, riot, catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace or by a major change in the condition forming the basis of the permit.
Form of permit. Each permit shall be in a form prescribed by the Park and Recreation Committee and shall designate the park, park facility or shelter area involved, date, hours of the exclusive use, purpose of the exclusive use and the name of the person, group, firm, organization, partnership or corporation to which the permit is issued.
Class B fermented malt beverage licenses. When fermented malt beverages are sold at any event authorized by this section, a valid fermented malt beverage license shall be obtained and the provisions of Chapter 78 shall be fully complied with. Said license must be held by the person who filed the original license and shall be presented to any law enforcement officer upon request.
Violation of terms of permit. It shall be unlawful for any person, organization or other entity to which a permit is issued for a specific park, park area or shelter to use or occupy a park, park area or shelter other than that for which the permit is issued. Any person, organization, or other entity violating this section shall be subject to immediate revocation of its permit and removal from the park, park area or shelter, forfeiture of the deposit paid, together with forfeiture as provided in §§ 121-6 and 121-7 of the Code of Ordinances.   
§ 121-6.  Violations and penalties.

Chapter 140 Records, Public
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Village Board of the Village of Holmen at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I). Amendments noted where applicable.]

§ 140-1.  Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

AUTHORITY — Any of the following village entities having custody of a village record: an office, elected official, agency, board, commission, committee, council, department or public body corporate and politic created by constitution, law, ordinance, rule or order or a formally constituted subunit of the foregoing.  

CUSTODIAN — That officer, department head, division head or employee of the village designated under § 140-3 or otherwise responsible by law to keep and preserve any village records or file, deposit or keep such records in his or her office or who is lawfully in possession or entitled to possession of such public records and who is required by this chapter to respond to requests for access to such records.  

RECORD — Any material on which written, drawn, printed, spoken, visual or electromagnetic information is recorded or preserved, regardless of physical form or characteristics, which has been created or is being kept by an authority. "Record" includes, but is not limited to, handwritten, typed or printed pages, maps, charts, photographs, films, recordings, tapes (including computer tapes) and computer printouts. "Record" does not include drafts, notes, preliminary computations and like materials prepared for the originator's personal use or prepared by the originator in the name of a person for whom the originator is working; materials which are purely the personal property of the custodian and have no relation to his or her office; materials to which access is limited by copyright, patent or bequest; and published materials in the possession of an authority other than a public library which are available for sale or which are available for inspection at a public library.

§ 140-2.  Duty to maintain records.
Except as provided under § 140-7, each officer and employee of the village shall safely keep and preserve all records received from his or her predecessor or other persons and required by law to be filed, deposited or kept in his or her office or which are in the lawful possession or control of the officer or employee or his or her deputies or to the possession or control of which he or she or they may be lawfully entitled as such officers or employees
Upon the expiration of an officer's term of office or an employee's term of employment, or whenever the office or position of employment becomes vacant, each such officer or employee shall deliver to his or her successor all records then in his or her custody, and the successor shall receipt therefor to the officer or employee, who shall file such receipt with the Village Clerk. If a vacancy occurs before a successor is selected or qualifies, such records shall be delivered to and receipted for by the Clerk on behalf of the successor, to be delivered to such successor upon the latter's receipt.  
§ 140-3.  Legal custodians.
The Village Clerk or, in his or her absence or disability or in case of vacancy, the Deputy Clerk is hereby designated the legal custodian of all village records.
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Village Clerk or the Clerk's designee shall act as legal custodian for the Village Board and for any committees, commissions, boards or other authorities created by ordinance or resolution of the Village Board.
For every authority not specified in Subsection A or B, the authority's chief administrative officer is the legal custodian for the authority, but the officer may designate an employee of his or her staff to act as the legal custodian.
Each legal custodian shall name a person to act as legal custodian in his or her absence or the absence of his or her designee.
The legal custodian shall have full legal power to render decisions and to carry out the duties of an authority under Subchapter II of Chapter 19 of the Wisconsin Statutes and this chapter. The designation of a legal custodian does not affect the powers and duties of an authority under this chapter.  
§ 140-4.  Public access to records.
Except as provided in § 140-6, any person has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of any record as provided in W.S.A. s. 19.35(1).
Records will be available for inspection and copying during all regular office hours.
If regular office hours are not maintained at the location where records are kept, the records will be available for inspection and copying upon at least 48 hours' advance notice of intent to inspect or copy.
A requester shall be permitted to use facilities comparable to those available to village employees to inspect, copy or abstract a record.
The legal custodian may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged.
A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows:
The cost of photocopying shall be set by resolution of the Village Board from time to time.
If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged.
The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper, such as films, computer printouts and audiotapes or videotapes, shall be charged.
If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged.
There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds $50, in which case the actual cost shall be determined by the legal custodian and billed to the requester.
The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and may require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment, if such estimate exceeds $5.
Elected and appointed officials of the village shall not be required to pay for public records they may reasonably require for the proper performance of their official duties.
The legal custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where he or she determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest.
Pursuant to W.S.A. s. 19.34 and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which, the legal custodian from whom and the methods whereby the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records or obtain copies of records and the costs thereof.  
§ 140-5.  Requests for records.
A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under W.S.A. s. 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under § 140-4F(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 140-6. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under W.S.A. s. 19.37(1) or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.  
§ 140-6.  Limitations on right to access.
As provided by W.S.A. s. 19.36, the following records are exempt from inspection under this chapter:
Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law.
Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state.
Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection.
A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret.
As provided by W.S.A. s. 43.30, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this chapter.
In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.
Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
Records of current deliberations regarding any village officer or employee concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline or the investigation of charges against a village officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure.
Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention.
Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of village property, investing of village funds or other village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.
Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data.
Communications between legal counsel for the village and any officer, agent or employee of the village when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved or communications which are privileged under W.S.A. s. 905.03.
If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the Village Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the Village Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment of the custodian and the Village Attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.  
§ 140-7.  Destruction of records.

Information and data (other than effluent data) about a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When such a confidentiality claim is asserted, the information shall be treated as such until a determination is made by the POTW. Effluent data shall be available to the public without restriction.
When the person furnishing a report satisfies the POTW that such person has made the demonstration required by Subsection A, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection except by the state or EPA for uses related to this chapter, the WPDES permit or the pretreatment program. Confidential portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or EPA in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information.   
§ 150-36.  Inspections; access to premises.

§ 150-47.  Sewer users served by Water Utility.
There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having a connection with the wastewater collection system and being served with water solely by the Water Utility a sewer service charge based, in part, on the quantity of water used, as measured by the Water Utility water meter used upon the premises.

§ 150-48.  Sewer users served by private wells.
There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having a connection with the wastewater collection system which procures any part or all water used from sources other than the Water Utility, all or part of which is discharged into the wastewater collection system, a sewer service charge based, in part, on the quantity of average residential water used, as determined by the Utility.

ARTICLE VI  Amount of Sewer Service Charges

§ 150-49.  Sewer service charge unit costs.
The unit costs for the sewer service charge shall be as defined in the current sewer service charge system.

§ 150-50.  Sewer service charges.
Residential, commercial, manufacturing and public authority are all charged based on the following methods:
Quarterly service charges.
Quarterly fixed charge is calculated annually based on the number of "residential equivalent units" in the village. The charge is determined as follows: (annual debt service cost + annual replacement fund amount) - (estimated connections fees)/estimated REU's/four quarters = fixed quarterly charge. Residential customers are assigned one REU per unit, all other sewer users are annually allocated REU's based on previous years consumption and charged the fixed rate per REU, per quarter.
Volume based charge is calculated annually based on the estimated volume of sewer consumption for the next year. The charge is determined as follows: (budgeted operating and maintenance cost)/estimated volumes per 1,000 gallons = volume charge per 1,000 gallons.
Other charges.
Reserve capacity charges(hook-up fees) are $540 per REU; after two, the fee is decreased to $378 per REU for the next 14 units and $270 for each additional unit after 16.
Southern service area connection charge: residential ($300 per REU and $225 per mobile home); commercial, manufacturing and public authority ($1,000 per acre).
Northwest service area connection charge: $280 per REU (subject to annual CPI adjustments).     
§ 150-51.  Operation, maintenance and replacement fund accounts.
All sewer service charge revenues collected for replacement costs shall be deposited in a separate and distinct fund to be used solely for replacement costs as defined in Article I. All sewer service charge revenues collected for other operation and maintenance expenses shall also be deposited in a separate and distinct fund.
All revenues for the replacement fund and for operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment facilities shall be used solely for the replacement fund and operation and maintenance of the wastewater facilities.   
§ 150-52.  Disposal of septic tank sludge and holding tank sewage.
No person in the business of gathering and disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage shall transfer such material into any disposal area or public sewage unless a permit for disposal has been first obtained from the approving authority. Written application for this permit shall be made to the approving authority and shall state the name and address of the applicant; the number of its disposal units; and the make, model and license number of each unit. Permits shall be nontransferable except in the case of replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall have been originally issued. The permit may be obtained upon payment of a fee per calendar year. The amount of the annual fee shall be as established by the approving authority. The time and place of disposal will be designated by the approving authority. The approving authority may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any permit granted.
Any person or party disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage agrees to carry public liability insurance in an amount as established by the approving authority to protect any and all persons or property from injury and/or damage caused in any way or manner by an act, or the failure to act, by any of the person's employees. The person(s) shall furnish a certificate certifying such insurance to be in full force and effect.
All materials disposed of into the treatment system shall be of domestic origin, or compatible pollutants only, and the person(s) agrees that they will comply with the provisions of any and all applicable ordinances of the municipality and shall not deposit or drain any gasoline, oil, acid, alkali, grease, rags, waste, volatile or flammable liquids or other deleterious substances into the public sewers, nor allow any earth, sand or other solid material to pass into any part of the wastewater treatment facilities.
Persons with a permit for disposing of septic tank sludge and/or holding tank sewage into the wastewater treatment facilities shall be charged a handling charge and a volume charge as defined in the current sewer service charge system.
The person(s) disposing wastes agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the municipality from any and all liability and claims for damages arising out of or resulting from work and labor performed.   
§ 150-53.  Charge for toxic pollutants.
Any person discharging toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge from the municipality's wastewater treatment facility shall pay for such increased costs, as may be determined by the approving authority.

§ 150-54.  Fees for industrial monitoring.
The POTW may adopt charges and fees which may include:
Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the POTW Pretreatment Program.
Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures, including the cost of reviewing monitoring reports submitted by the industrial user.
Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction.
Fees for permit applications, including the cost of processing such applications.
Fees for filing appeals.
Other fees as the POTW may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the POTW.   
§ 150-55.  Reserve capacity assessments.
There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot or parcel of land subsequently attached to the village a reserve capacity assessment (RCA). Such RCA charge shall be payable as herein provided and shall be on the basis of one RCA charge for each residential equivalent connection connected to the sewer system.
Existing and future connections. For the purpose of this chapter, sewer connections in the village shall be classified as existing connections or future connections. Existing connections shall be those in existence and connection for which a sewer connection permit has been issued and construction started as of 11:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Future connections shall be those not in existence as of 11:59 p.m., December 31, 1999.
Schedule of charges. The reserve capacity assessment shall be as established by the approving authority, which shall also be the unit of charge for a residential equivalent connection. The Village Engineer shall determine the residential equivalency units for all other categories of buildings. Special charges may be determined by the approving authority for large commercial or industrial users.
Payments. There shall be no RCA charge for existing connections. Payments of the RCA charge for future connections shall be made in full upon the issuance of a connection permit.   
§ 150-56.  Unique users.
The approving authority may, at any time hereafter, establish additional rates for any large commercial service, industrial use or any other unique user that does not readily fit into other user categories.

§ 150-57.  Northwest Sanitary Sewer Area base sewer connection charge.
It is hereby found and determined that a necessity exists for determining an equitable method for apportioning the future costs of installing of a sanitary sewer system in lands which may be developed or annexed within the Northwest Sanitary Sewer Area and may not be presently within the corporate limits of the village, but may, in the future, become part of the village. As a result, the Village of Holmen does hereby establish a base sewer connection charge. This connection charge shall be in addition to all other hook-up fees. The amount of the base connection charge shall be $280 per residential equivalent unit. Said charge shall be adjusted annually with the first adjustment being made on January 1, 1999. The adjustment will be calculated by multiplying the connection charge by the consumer price index percentage. Said adjustment shall be added to the previous connection charge.
The sewer connection charge shall be paid to the Village Treasurer, by the owner(s) of each developed lot or parcels prior to connecting to the village's sanitary sewer system.
The Northwest Sanitary Service Area consists of those lands designated in the map which is denominated as Exhibit A, a copy of which is attached hereto.[1]   

ARTICLE VII Billing Practice

§ 150-58.  Calculation of user charges.
User charges shall be computed according to the formula presented in this chapter and according to the current user charge system.

§ 150-59.  User charge billing period.
User charges shall be billed by quarterly.

§ 150-60.  Payment of sewer service charges.
Those persons billed by the village for the sewer service charges shall pay such charges within 20 days after the billing date.

§ 150-61.   Payment of charges.
Such charges levied in accordance with this section shall be a debt due to the approving authority and shall be a lien upon the property. If this debt is not paid within 20 days of the date of the bill, a penalty of 1 1/2% per month of the unpaid balance shall be added to delinquent bills.
In the event of failure to pay sewer service charges after they become delinquent, the approving authority shall have the right to remove or close sewer connections and enter upon the property for accomplishing such purposes.
The expense of such removal or closing, as well as the expense of restoring service, shall likewise be a debt to the village and a lien upon the property and may be recovered by civil action in the name of the approving authority against the property owner, the person or both.
Sewer service shall not be restored until all charges, including the expense of removal, closing and restoration shall have been paid.
Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.
Every reasonable care will be exercised in the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a sewer bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for payment of sewer rates within the prescribed period, nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof.
On October 15 in each year, notice shall be given to the owner or occupant of all lots or parcels of real estate to which service has been furnished prior to October 1 and payment for which is owing and in arrears at the time of giving such notice. The Utility shall furnish the Village Clerk with a list of all such lots or parcels of real estate, and the notice shall be given by the Utility. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state the amount of such arrears, including any penalty assessed pursuant to the rules of such Utility; that unless the same is paid by November 1, a penalty of 10% of the amount of such arrears may be added thereto; and that unless such arrears and penalty are paid by November 15, the same will be levied as a tax against the lot or parcel of real estate to which service was furnished and for which payment is delinquent as above specified. Such notice may be served by delivery to either such owner or occupant personally or by letter addressed to either owner or occupant at the post office address of such lot or parcel of real estate. Each such delinquent amount, including such penalty, shall thereupon become a lien upon the lot or parcel of real estate to which the service was furnished and payment for which is delinquent. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent taxes shall apply to said tax if the same is not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes upon real estate.   

ARTICLE VIII Cost Recovery for Sewer Extension

§ 150-62.  Areas provided with service.
Sewer services and extensions will be provided only to those areas located within the village corporate limits, which will be expanded from time to time.

Where the cost of the extension is to immediately be collected through assessment by the municipality against the abutting property, the procedure set forth under Section 66.60 of the Wisconsin Statutes will apply, and no additional customer contribution to the utility will be required.
Where the municipality is unwilling or unable to make a special assessment, the extension will be made on a customer-financed basis as follows:
The applicant(s) will advance as a contribution in aid of construction their proportionate share of the total amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed for all property under Subsection A; or
At the discretion of the Village of Holmen, extensions will be made as follows:
The applicant(s) will advance as a contribution in aid of construction their proportionate share of the total amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed for all property under Subsection A.
Part of the contribution required in Subsection B(2)(a) will be refundable. When additional customers are connected to the extended main within 20 years of the date of completion, contributions in aid of construction will be collected equal to the amount which would have been assessed under Subsection A for the abutting property being served. This amount will be refunded to the original contributor(s). In no case will the contributions received from additional customers exceed the proportionate amount which would have been required under Subsection A nor will it exceed the total assessable cost of the original extension.
When a customer connects to a transmission main or connecting loop installed at utility expense within 20 years of the date of completion, there will be a contribution required of an amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed under Subsection A.

§ 154-1.  Purpose and findings.

The Village Board of the Village of Holmen intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons civilly responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Village Board of the Village of Holmen finds: 

Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
Alcohol, which if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some circumstances, provide the alcohol. 
A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

Any qualifying property owner may seek a credit against the ERU charge for that portion of the property that does not drain into any stormwater conveyance or facility operated or maintained by the stormwater utility in an amount above and beyond that minimum required by law.
Any qualifying property owner may seek a credit against the SC charge if stormwater from the property does not drain into any stormwater conveyance or facility that is the subject of the special charge in an amount above and beyond that minimum required by law.
The Village Engineer shall evaluate the quantifiable benefits in both quantity and quality management measures in reviewing requests for credits, where applicable. In all cases, the Village Engineer shall submit a written recommendation to the Village Board as to whether a request for credit should be granted, denied, or granted in part and denied in part. The written recommendation shall also set forth the reason or reasons for such recommendation.
Credit applications shall be decided by the Village Board and shall be either one-time credits or may be continuing credits against recurring charges as determined appropriate based on the recommendation of the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer shall recommend a credit under Subsection C (1) only if he/she finds all of the following:
If the credit is based on special facilities or management practices under Subsection C(1);
The facilities installed or practices undertaken will reduce the expenses incurred by the utility by limiting the quantity and/or improving the quality of discharges into the facilities of the utility from the property in an amount above and beyond that minimum required by law;
The qualifying property owner has, by contract, deed restriction or other method approved by the Village Engineer, ensured that the Village may legally enforce any operational or maintenance programs necessary to assure that the facilities or practices will continue to provide the benefits on which the credit is based;
The investment of the qualifying property owner in the facilities or management practices exceeded the investment that would otherwise be necessary in order to comply with any other Village ordinance, state or federal regulations or to obtain any land division or development approval from the Village;
The investment of the qualifying property owner in such facilities or management practices is disproportionate to the investment made by the average property owner subject to the same normal charges such that it would be inequitable to charge the applicant on the same basis; and
The amount of the credit does not exceed the cost savings to the utility from the facilities and management practices maintained by the qualifying applicant up to 50% of the utility fees less the BC.
If the credit is based on Subsection C(2) or (3):
That the absence of drainage from the property or a portion thereof into the facilities of the Utility results in financial savings to the Utility.
Adequate assurances are provided that the area of the property for which the credit is given will not be altered in such a way as to allow drainage into the facilities operated by the Utility.
The drainage from the property is managed in a way which complies with all Village ordinances and does not cause a nuisance condition.
The amount of the credit does not exceed the cost savings to the utility determined under Subsection E(2)(a).
The Utility may revoke the credit in any case where, based on the opinion of the Village Engineer, the circumstances forming the basis for the credit have materially changed. The Utility shall provide at least 30 days advance written notice of any proposed credit revocation.
A denial or revocation of any credit may be appealed under § 157-10.   
§ 157-8.  Customer classifications.
For purposes of imposing the ERU charges, all lots and parcels within the Village shall be classified into the following six customer classes:
Residential - single family;
Residential - duplex;
Residential - Multifamily, including condominiums;
Nonresidential;
Undeveloped;
Exempt.
The Village Engineer shall prepare a list of properties within the Village and assign a customer classification to each lot or parcel.
ERUs shall be calculated for each property classification as follows:
Residential - single family: one ERU.
Residential - duplex: two ERUs.
Residential - multifamily: one ERU per dwelling unit.
For nonresidential parcels, the Village Engineer shall be responsible for determining the impervious area from available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the Village Assessor, the property owner, tenant or developer, aerial photography, or by actual on-site measurement. The Village Engineer may require additional information from the property owner as necessary to make the determination. The ERU value for a nonresidential property shall be determined by dividing its impervious area by the number of square feet per ERU and rounding the quotient to the next higher .1 ERU. The minimum ERU charge to nonresidential properties will be 1 ERU. The billing amount shall be updated by the Utility as necessary based on changes to the amount of impervious area on the property.
Undeveloped properties - zero ERU, are subject to the BC.
Exempt - zero ERU, are not subject to the BC.     
§ 157-9.  Billing and penalties.
Stormwater Utility charges will be billed quarterly with the water utility, sanitary sewer utility and refuse billing. All charges shall be due and payable 20 days after the date of billing.
Billings for applicable charges shall be mailed to the designated property owner. The owner of the property shall be liable for all stormwater utility charges in the event payment is not made as required in this chapter. The owner of any property served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine collection records of the Village to determine whether such charges for such property have been paid at the office of the Utility Billing Clerk during normal business hours.
Any Stormwater Utility charges remaining unpaid more than 20 days from the date of billing shall be deemed delinquent and shall be subject to a 1 1/2 % per month (18% APR) late payment charge in addition to all other charges. All delinquent charges shall be collected as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0821(4) and 66.0809.   
§ 157-10.  Appeals.
Any Stormwater Utility charge, determination of ERUs, or ERU credits for any individual qualifying property may be appealed by filing a written appeal with the Village Clerk not later than 20 days after the date the payment is due. The appeal shall specify all bases for the appeal and the amount of the stormwater charge the appellant asserts is appropriate. Any appeal not filed within the time permitted by this section shall be deemed waived. As a condition to maintaining an appeal, the appellant shall pay all charges billed under protest prior to filing the appeal.
The Village Engineer shall review the appeal and determine whether the challenged determination is fair and reasonable and consistent with the provisions of this chapter, and whether a refund is due the customer. The Village Engineer shall determine his/her procedure for deciding such appeals which, at a minimum, shall provide the appellant with written notice by regular mail at least 10 days prior to the Public Works Committee meeting at which the appeal will be reviewed, and an opportunity to present evidence and be heard on the appeal at such meeting. The Village Engineer shall provide the appellant with the Committee's decision in writing within 15 days after the date of the decision.
The appellant may appeal the decision of the Committee to the Village Board. The appeal must be filed in writing with the Village Clerk within 30 days from the date of the decision. An appeal to the Village Board shall be limited to the evidence presented to the Public Works Committee, but the appellant shall be afforded the opportunity to present arguments based on that evidence.
If the Village Engineer, Public Works Committee or the Board determines that the decision appealed from should be reversed or modified, it shall determine whether a refund is due the customer. Any refund ordered shall be applied as a credit against the customer's next stormwater billing if the refund will not exceed the customer's next stormwater billing, and otherwise will be refunded by the Village Treasurer.   
§ 157-11.  Special assessment and charges.
In addition to any other method for collection of the charges established pursuant to this chapter for Stormwater Utility costs, the Village Board may order that the charges be levied against the property as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 66.0627. The mailing of an invoice reflecting the charges due to the owner shall be notice to the owner that failure to pay the charges when due may result in such charges being placed upon the tax roll. A ten-percent administrative handling fee will be applied.
In addition to any other method of charging for Stormwater Utility expenses, the Village Board may, by resolution, levy special assessments on property in a limited and determinable area for special benefits conferred upon property by any public improvements pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 66.0703. The failure to pay such special assessments shall result in a lien on the property and shall be enforced pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 66.0703(13).   
§ 157-12.  Severability.
If any provision of this chapter is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such determination shall not affect the validity or application of, the remaining provisions. A determination of invalidity or unenforceability of any provision as applied to any specific property or circumstance shall not affect the validity and application of such provisions to any other property or circumstances.

[Adopted 10-5-1978]

No person shall make or cause to be made any excavation or opening in any street, alley, highway, sidewalk or other public way within the Village without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Board of Public Works. 

§ 159-11.  Permit fee. [2] 

The fee for a street opening permit shall be $10 and shall be paid to the Village Treasurer who shall issue his receipt therefor. 

§ 159-12.  Bond.

Such bond shall be further conditioned that he will observe the provisions of all state laws, ordinances, rules and regulations governing the issuance of permits under this article. Such bonds may be filed individually for each excavation, or an annual bond may be given covering all excavation work done by the principal for one year beginning January 1. 

§ 159-13.  Insurance.

Prior to commencement of excavation work, a permittee must furnish the Board of Public Works satisfactory evidence that he has in force and will maintain during the life of the permit and the period of excavation, public liability insurance of not less than $100,000 for one person, $300,000 for one accident and property damage insurance of not less than $50,000. 

§ 159-14.  Regulations governing street and sidewalk openings.

In opening any street or other public way, all paving or ballasting materials shall be removed with the least possible loss of or injury to surfacing materials and, together with the excavated material from trenches, shall be placed so as to cause the least practicable inconvenience to the public and permit free flow of water along gutters. 
Every person shall enclose with sufficient barriers each opening which he may make in the streets or public ways of the Village. All machinery and equipment shall be locked or otherwise effectively safeguarded from unauthorized use when not being used by the permittee, his agents or employees. Lights shall be installed according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (latest edition), kept burning from sunset to sunrise, lights to be placed at each end of the opening in the street or way and other lights sufficient in number and properly spaced to give adequate warning. Except by special permission from the Village Engineering Department, no trench shall be excavated more than 250 feet in advance of pipe laying nor left unfilled more than 500 feet where pipe has been laid. All necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public effectively from accidents or damage to persons or property through the period of the work. Each person making such openings shall be held liable for all damages, including costs incurred by the Village in defending any action brought against it for damages, as well as costs of any appeal, that may result from neglect by such person or his employees of any necessary precaution against injury or damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind.

After such permanent improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open, cut or excavate said street for a period of five years after the date of improvement or repaving unless in the opinion of the Board of Public Works an emergency exists which makes it absolutely essential that the permit be issued.

One or more such office audit determinations may be made of the amount due for anyone or for more than one period. 
The Village Clerk may, by field audit, determine the tax required to be paid to the village or the refund due to any person under this article. The determination may be made upon the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or upon any other information within the Village Clerk's possession. The Village Clerk is authorized to examine and inspect the books, records, memoranda and property of any person in order to verify the tax liability of that person or of another person. Nothing herein shall prevent the Village Clerk from making a determination of tax at any time.   
§ 164-9.  Failure to file return.

On the basis of this estimate, the Village Clerk shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the village, adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty equal to 10% thereof. One or more determinations may be made for one or more than one period. 
All unpaid taxes under this article shall bear interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the due date of the return until the first day of the month following the month in which the tax is due or deposited with the Village Clerk. 
Delinquent tax returns shall be subject to a late filing fee of $10. The tax imposed by this article shall become delinquent if not paid:

§ 166-5.  Collocation requirements.
All commercial wireless telecommunications towers erected, constructed, or located within the Village shall comply with the following requirements:
A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunications service tower shall not be approved unless the Planning Commission and Village Board finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one-mile radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
It shall be the developer's responsibility to provide adequate proof that no such opportunity for collocation is possible.
Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunications service tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for the at least one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height.

ARTICLE I  Oak Wilt and Dutch Elm Disease [Adopted 10-5-1978]

§ 172-1.  Intent and purpose; public nuisances declared.
Whereas the Board of Trustees has determined that there are many elm trees and oak trees growing on public and private premises within the Village of Holmen, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the village, and that the health and life of such trees is threatened by a fatal disease known as Dutch elm disease and oak wilt, which is spread by elm bark beetles and oak wilt beetles, the Board hereby declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of such disease and the insect pests and vectors which carry such diseases and declares Dutch elm disease and oak wilt and the insects which carry such disease to be public nuisances.

§ 172-2.  Enforcement by Board of Public Works.
The Board of Public Works shall carry out the provisions of this article. It may employ a forester or designate a municipal employee to perform the duties of forester under Ch. 27 of the Wisconsin Statutes and may authorize such forester to perform the duties and exercise the powers imposed on the Board by this article.

§ 172-3.  Definitions.
As used in this article, unless otherwise clearly indicated by the context, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

PERSON — Person, firm or corporation.  

PUBLIC NUISANCE  
Dutch elm disease or oak wilt disease.
Elm bark beetles or oak wilt beetles.
Any living or standing elm tree or oak tree or part thereof infected with the Dutch elm disease or oak wilt fungus or in a weakened condition which harbors any of the elm bark or oak wilt beetles.
Any dead elm tree or oak tree or part thereof, or any logs, branches, stumps, firewood or other elm or oak material from which the bark has not been removed and burned or sprayed with an effective elm bark or oak bark beetle destroying concentrate.    
PUBLIC PROPERTY — Premises owned or controlled by the village including, without limitation because of enumeration, public sites, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys, sidewalks, boulevards, and the terrace strip between the lot line and the curb or improved portion of any public way.  

§ 172-4.  Inspection.
The Village Board of Public Works shall inspect or cause to be inspected at least twice each year all premises and places within the village to determine whether any public nuisance exists thereon. It shall also inspect or cause the inspection of any elm tree or oak tree reported or suspected to be infected with Dutch elm disease or oak wilt or any bark bearing material reported or suspected to be infested with elm bark beetles or oak wilt beetles
Whenever necessary to determine the existence of Dutch elm disease or elm bark beetles or oak wilt disease in any tree, the person inspecting such tree shall remove or cut specimens from the tree in such manner as to avoid permanent injury thereto and deliver such specimens to the Board, which shall forward them to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture at Madison for analysis to determine the presence of such nuisances.
The Board and its agents or employees shall have authority to enter upon private premises at reasonable times for the purpose of carrying out any of the provisions of this article.   
§ 172-5.  Abatement of nuisances; duty of Board of Public Works.
The Board of Public Works shall order, direct, supervise and control the abatement of public nuisances as defined in this article by spraying, removal, burning or by other means which it determines to be necessary to prevent as fully as possible the spread of Dutch elm disease or oak wilt fungus or the insect pests or vectors known to carry such disease fungus.
Whenever the Board of Public Works after inspection or examination shall determine that a public nuisance as herein defined exists on public property in the village, it shall immediately abate or cause the abatement of such nuisance in such manner as to destroy or prevent as fully as possible the spread of Dutch elm disease or oak wilt disease or the insect or vectors known to carry such disease fungus.
When the Board of Public Works shall determine with reasonable certainty that a public nuisance exists upon private premises (or upon the terrace strip between the lot line and the curb), it shall immediately serve or cause to be served personally or by registered mail upon the owner of such property (or the abutting property), if he can be found, or upon the occupant thereof, a written notice of the existence of such nuisance and of a time and place for a hearing, not less than 14 days after service of such notice, on the abatement action to be taken. Such notice shall describe the nuisance and recommended procedures for its abatement, and shall further state that unless the owner shall abate the nuisance in the manner specified in the notice, or shall appear at the hearing to show that such nuisance does not exist or does not endanger the health of elm or oak trees in the village, the Board of Public Works shall cause the abatement thereof at the expense of the property served (or abutting property).

Billing. Bills for water service are rendered quarterly and become due and payable upon issuance following the period for which service is rendered. A late payment charge of 1% per month will be added to bills not paid within 20 days of issuance. This late payment charge will be applied to the total unpaid balance for utility service, including unpaid late payment charges. This late payment charge is applicable to all customers. The utility customer may be given a written notice that the bill is overdue no sooner than 20 days after the bill is issued. Unless payment or satisfactory arrangement for payment is made within the next 10 days, service may be disconnected pursuant to Wis. Adm. Code ch. PSC 185. 
Combined metering. Volumetric meter readings will be combined for billing if the utility for its own convenience places more than one meter on a single water service lateral. Multiple meters placed for the purpose of identifying water not discharged into the sanitary sewer are not considered for utility convenience and shall not be combined for billing. This requirement does not preclude the utility from combining readings where metering configurations support such an approach. Meter readings from individually metered separate service laterals shall not be combined for billing purposes.   
§ 187-4.  Other charges. 

A charge of $30 shall apply to the customer's account when a check rendered for utility service is returned for insufficient funds. This charge may not be in addition to, but may be inclusive of, other insufficient funds charges when the check was for payment of multiple services. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-5.  General suburban service. 

Water customers residing outside the corporate limits of the Village of Holmen shall be billed at the regular rates for service (Schedule Mg-1) plus a 25% surcharge. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-6.  General unmetered water service. 

Where the utility cannot immediately install its water meter, service may be supplied temporarily on an unmetered basis. Such service shall be billed at the rate of $52.60 per quarter. This rate shall be applied only to single-family residential and small commercial customers and approximates the cost of 20,000 gallons of water per quarter under Schedule Mg-1. If it is determined by the utility that usage is in excess of 20,000 gallons of water per quarter, an additional charge per Schedule Mg-1 will be made for the estimated additional usage. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-7.  Public service. 

Water service supplied to municipal buildings, schools, sewer treatment plants, etc., shall be metered and the regular metered service rates (Schedule Mg-1) applied. 
Water used on an intermittent basis for flushing sewers, street sprinkling, flooding skating rinks, drinking fountains, etc., shall be metered where meters can be set to measure the service. Where it is impossible to measure the service, the Superintendent shall estimate the volume of water used based on the pressure, size of opening and period of time water is allowed to be drawn. The estimated quantity used shall be billed at the rate of $1.60 per 1,000 gallons. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-8.  Reconnection charges.

Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-9.  Seasonal, emergency or temporary service. 

Seasonal customers [NOTE: Seasonal customers are general service customers whose use of water is normally for recurring periods of less than a year.] shall pay an annual seasonal service charge equal to four times the applicable service charge in Schedule Mg-1. Water use in any billing period shall be billed at the applicable volume rates in Schedule Mg-1 and the charge added to the annual seasonal service charge. 
For disconnections of service not previously considered as seasonal, emergency, or temporary, if service is resumed at the same premises by the same customer within a twelve-month period, and if there has been no service to another customer during the intervening period, the customer shall be billed for the pro rata share of the applicable service charge for the period of disconnection. 
Further, if service has been disconnected or a meter removed, a charge under Schedule R-1 shall be applied at the time of reconnection or meter installation. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-10.  Building and construction water service.

Building and construction water service rates shall be as follows: 

For single-family and small commercial buildings, apply the unmetered rate (Schedule Ug-1). 
For large commercial, industrial or multiple apartment buildings, a temporary metered installation shall be made and general metered rates (Schedule Mg-1) applied. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   

§ 187-11.  Bulk water. 

All bulk water supplied from the water system through hydrants or other connections shall be metered, or at the direction of the utility, estimated. Utility personnel or a utility-approved party shall supervise the delivery of water. 
Bulk water sales are: 
(1)    Water supplied to tank truck or from hydrants for the purpose of extinguishing fires outside the utility's immediate service area; 

(2)    Water supplied by tank truck or from hydrants for purposes other than extinguishing fires, such as irrigation or the filling of swimming pools; or 

(3)    Water supplied from hydrants or other temporary connections for general service-type applications. (Water supplied for construction purposes: see Schedule Mz-1.)   

A charge for the volume of water used will be billed to the party using the water at $1.88 per 1,000 gallons. A service charge, in addition to the volumetric charge, will be $40. In addition, for meters that are assigned to bulk water customers for more than 30 days, the applicable service charge in Schedule Mg-1 will apply after the first 30 days. 
The water utility may require reasonable deposits for the temporary use of its equipment under this and other rate schedules. The deposit(s) collected will be refunded upon return of the utility's equipment. Damaged or lost equipment will be repaired or replaced at the customer's expense. 
Billing shall be the same as in Schedule Mg-1.   
§ 187-12.  Water lateral installation charge. 

Subdivision developers shall be responsible, where the main extension has been approved by the utility, for the water service lateral installation costs from the main through the curb stop and box. 
When the cost of a utility main extension is to be collected through assessment by the municipality, the actual average water lateral installation costs from the main through the curb stop and box shall be included in the assessment of the appropriate properties. 
The initial water service lateral(s), not installed as part of a subdivision development or an assessable utility extension, will be installed from the main through the curb stop and box by the utility, for which the actual cost will be charged.   
§ 187-13.  Compliance with water utility operating rules.

All persons now receiving water service from this water utility, or who may request service in the future, shall be considered as having agreed to be bound by the rules and regulations as filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.  


§ 187-14.  Establishment of water service. 

Application for water service may be made in writing on a form furnished by the water utility. The application will contain the legal description of the property to be served, name of the owner, the exact use to be made of the service, and the size of the service lateral and meter desired. Note particularly any special refrigeration, fire protection or water-consuming air-conditioning equipment. 
Service will be furnished only if: 
(1)    The premises have a frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in which a cast iron or other long-life water main has been laid, or where the property owner has agreed to and complied with the provisions of the utility's filed main extension rule; 

(2)    The property owner has installed or agrees to install a service lateral from the curb stop to the point of use that is not less than six feet below the surface of an established or proposed grade and meets the water utility's specification; and 

(3)    The premises have adequate piping beyond the metering point.   

The owner of a multi-unit dwelling has the option of being served by individual metered water service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this option, is required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable individual metered service to each unit and individual disconnection without affecting service to other units. Each meter and meter connection will be a treated as a separate water utility account for the purpose of the filed rules and regulations. 
No division of the water service lateral to any lot or parcel of land shall be made for the extension and independent metering of the supply to an adjoining lot or parcel of land. Except for duplexes, no division of a water supply lateral shall be made at the curb for separate supplies for two or more separate premises having frontage on any street or public service strip, whether owned by the same or different parties. 
Duplexes may be served by one lateral provided: 
(1)    Individual metered service and disconnection is provided; and 

(2)    It is permitted by local ordinance.   

Buildings used in the same business, located on the same parcel, and served by a single lateral may have the customer's water supply piping installed t a central point so that volume can be metered in one place. 
The water utility may withhold approval of any application where full information of the purpose of such supply is not clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner.   
§ 187-15.  Service contracts. 

Where the water utility has disconnected service at the customer's request, a reconnection charge shall be made when the customer requests reconnection of service. See Schedule R-1 for the applicable rate. 
A reconnection charge shall also be required from consumers whose services are disconnected (shut off at curb stop box) because of nonpayment of bills when due. See Schedule R-1 for the applicable rate. 
If reconnection is requested for the same location by any member of the same household, or, if a place of business, by any partner of the same business, it shall be considered as the same customer.   
§ 187-16.  Temporary metered service; meter and deposits.

An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and maintain a monetary deposit for each meter installed, as security for payment for use of water and for such other charges which may arise from the use of the supply. A charge shall be made for setting the valve and furnishing and setting the meter. See Schedule BW-1 for applicable rate. 

§ 187-17.  Water for construction. 

When water is requested for construction purposes or for filling tanks or other such uses, an application shall be made to the water utility, in writing, giving a statement of the amount of construction work to be done or the size of the tank to be filled, etc. Payment for the water for construction may be required in advance at the scheduled rates. The service lateral must be installed into the building before water can be used. No connection with the service lateral at the curb shall be made without special permission from the water utility. In no case will any employee of the water utility turn on water for construction work unless the contractor has obtained permission from the water utility. 
Consumers shall not allow contractors, masons or other persons to take water from their premises without permission from the water utility. Any customer failing to comply with this provision may have water service discontinued and will be responsible for the cost of the estimated volume of water used.   
§ 187-18.  Use of hydrants. 

In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the water utility to use a hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until the proper meter and valve are installed. In no case shall any valve be installed or moved except by an employee of the water utility. 
Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the water to be used at the scheduled rates. Where applicable, see Schedule BW-1 for deposits and charges. Upon completing the use of the hydrant, the customer must notify the utility to that effect.    
§ 187-19.  Operation of valves and hydrants and unauthorized use of water.

Any person who shall, without authority of the water utility, allow contractors, masons or other unauthorized persons to take water from their premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or open any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the purpose of extinguishing fire, or who shall wantonly damage or impair the same, shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100 nor more than $500 for the first offense and not less than $200 nor more than $1,000 for a subsequent offense. Each day, or portion thereof, that such violation continues is hereby deemed to constitute a separate offense. Utility permission for the use of hydrants applies only to such hydrants that are designated for the specific use. 

§ 187-20.  Refunds of monetary deposits.

All moneys deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of temporary water service on a metered basis, or for the return of a hydrant valve and fixtures if the water is used on an unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor, and the return of the water utility's equipment. 

§ 187-21.  Service connections or water laterals. 

No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service lateral, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the water utility. Service laterals passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service lateral and the channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with oakum, mastic cement or other resilient material and made impervious to moisture. 
In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling around the pipe. There should be at least six inches of ground filling over the pipe, and it should be free from hard lumps, rocks, stones or other injurious material. All water service laterals shall be of undiminished size from the street main into the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve, the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of the water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.   
§ 187-22.  Replacement and repair of service laterals. 

The service lateral from the main to and through the curb stop will be maintained and kept in repair and, when worn out, replaced at the expense of the water utility. The property owner shall maintain the service lateral from the curb stop to the point of use. 
If an owner fails to repair a leaking or broken service lateral from the curb to the point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the water utility after notification has been served on the owner by the water utility, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed.   
§ 187-23.  Abandonment of service.

If a property owner changes the use of a property currently receiving water service such that water service will no longer be needed in the future, the water utility may require the abandonment of the water service at the water main. In such case, the property owner may be responsible for all removal and/or repair costs, including the water main and the utility portion of the water service lateral. 

§ 187-24.  Charges for water wasted due to leaks.

For provisions regarding charges for water wasted due to leaks, see Wis. Adm. Code, § PSC 185.35. 

§ 187-25.  Thawing frozen service laterals.

For provisions regarding thawing frozen services, see Wis. Adm. Code, § PSC 185.88. 

§ 187-26.  Curb stop boxes.

The curb stop box is the property of the water utility. The water utility is responsible for its repair and maintenance. This includes maintaining, through adjustment, the curb stop box at an appropriate grade level where no direct action by the property owner or occupant has contributed to an elevation problem. The property owner is responsible for protecting the curb stop box from situations that could obstruct access to it or unduly expose it to harm. The water utility shall not be liable for failure to locate the curb stop box and shut off the water in case of a leak on the owner's premises. 

§ 187-27.  Installation of meters.

Meters will be owned, furnished and installed by the water utility or a utility-approved contractor and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by the customer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from obstructions and permit ready access for reading, inspection and servicing, such location to be designated or approved by the water utility. All piping within the building must be supplied by the owner. Where additional meters are desired by the owner, the owner shall pay for all piping. Where applicable, see Schedule Am-1 for rates. 

§ 187-28.  Repairs to meters. 

Meters will be repaired by the water utility, and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the water utility. 
Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises, owner's agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of any one of them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be damaged from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the customer or the owner of the premises.   
§ 187-29.  Service piping for meter settings. 

Where the original service piping is installed for a new metered customer, where existing service piping is changed for the customer's convenience, or where a new meter is installed for an existing unmetered customer, the owner of the premises at his/her expense shall provide a suitable location and the proper connections for the meter. The meter setting and associated plumbing shall comply with the water utility's standards. The water utility should be consulted as to the type and size of meter setting.   
§ 187-30.  Turning on water.

The water may only be turned on for a customer by an authorized employee of the water utility. Plumbers may turn the water on to test their work, but upon completion, must leave the water turned off. 

§ 187-31.  Failure to read meters. 

Where the water utility is unable to read a meter, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the bill paid the preceding period. Only in unusual cases shall more than three consecutive estimated or minimum bills be rendered. 
If the meter is damaged (see § 187-43, Surreptitious use of water) or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year, unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly determined, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. 
For provisions regarding failure to read meters, see Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.33.   
§ 187-32.  Complaint meter tests.

For provisions regarding complaint meter tests, see Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 185.77. 

§ 187-33.  Inspection of premises.

During reasonable hours, any officer or authorized employee of the water utility shall have the right of access to the premises supplied with service for the purpose of inspection or for the enforcement of the water utility's rules and regulations. Whenever appropriate, the water utility will make a systematic inspection of all unmetered water taps for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of water. For provisions regarding inspection of premises, see Wis. Adm. Code § PSC 196.171. 

§ 187-34.  Vacation of premises.

When premises are to be vacated, the water utility shall be notified, in writing, at once, so that it may remove the meter and shut off the water supply at the curb stop. The owner of the premises shall be liable for prosecution for any damage to the water utility's property. See "Abandonment of Service" in Schedule X-1 for further information.

If there is an existing medical emergency in your home and you furnish the water utility with a statement signed by either a licensed Wisconsin physician or a public health official, we will delay disconnection of service up to 21 days. The statement must identify the medical emergency and specify the period of time during which disconnection will aggravate the existing emergency. 

§ 187-41.  Deferred payment agreements. 

If you are a residential customer and, for some reason, you are unable to pay the full amount of the water utility service arrears on your bill, you may contact the utility to discuss arrangements to pay the arrears over an extended period of time. 
This time payment agreement will require: 
(1)    Payment of a reasonable amount at the time the agreement is made. 

(2)    Payment of the remainder of the outstanding balance in monthly installments over a reasonable length of time. 

(3)    Payment of all future utility service bills in full by the due date.   

In any situation, where you are unable to resolve billing disputes or disputes about the grounds for proposed disconnection through contacts with our water utility, you may make an appeal to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin by calling (800) 225-7729. (WATER UTILITY NAME)   
§ 187-42.  Collection of overdue bills.

An amount owed by the customer may be levied as a tax as provided in Wis. Stat. § 66.0809. 

§ 187-43.  Surreptitious use of water. 

When the water utility has reasonable evidence that a person is obtaining water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering of the water utility service being delivered, the water utility reserves the right to estimate and present immediately a bill for unmetered service as a result of such interference, and such bill shall be payable subject to a twenty-four-hour disconnection of service. If the water utility disconnects the service for any such reason, the water utility will reconnect the service upon the following conditions: 
(1)    The customer will be required to deposit with the utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the payment of the bills for water utility service. 

(2)    The customer will be required to pay the water utility for any and all damages to water utility resulting from such interference with the metering. 

(3)    The customer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the water utility against further losses.

Water Main Extension

§ 187-49.  Water main extension.

Water mains will be extended for new customers on the following basis: 

Where the cost of the extension is to immediately be collected through assessment by the municipality against the abutting property, the procedure set forth under Wis. Stat. § 66.0703 will apply, and no additional customer contribution to the utility will be required. 
Where the municipality is unwilling or unable to make a special assessment, the extension will be made on a customer-financed basis as follows: 
(1)    The applicant(s) will advance as a contribution in aid of construction the total amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed for all property under Subsection A. 

(2)    Part of the contribution required in Subsection B(1) will be refundable. When additional customers are connected to the extended main within 10 years of the date of completion, contributions in aid of construction will be collected equal to the amount which would have been assessed under Subsection A for the abutting property being served. This amount will be refunded to the original contributor(s). In no case will the contributions received from additional customers exceed the proportionate amount which would have been required under Subsection A, nor will it exceed the total assessable cost of the original extension.   

When a customer connects to a transmission main or connecting loop installed at utility expense within 10 years of the date of completion, there will be a contribution required of an amount equivalent to that which would have been assessed under Subsection A.

Fluoridation

[Added 2-13-2014 by Ord. No. 1-2014]

§ 187-75.  Intent.

The Village of Holmen Water Utility shall henceforth maintain and implement a continually active fluoride feed system at each well site to fluoridate the public water supply. All fluoridation systems shall use hydrofluorosilicic acid (23% to 25%) that has 19.8% fluoride ions. 

§ 187-76.  Requirements.

The Village of Holmen Water Utility shall abide by the Department of Natural Resources' requirements for fluoride and chemical injection, as follows: 

Section NR 809.11(2), Wisconsin Administrative Code, establishes a primary maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 4.0 mg/l for fluoride; 
Section NR 809.70(1), Wisconsin Administrative Code, establishes a secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) of 2.0 mg/l for fluoride; 
Section NR 809.74(1)(a), Wisconsin Administrative Code, requires that water systems adding fluoride have a routine monitoring program to ensure the levels of fluoride in the water system fall within the optimal range of fluoride established by the Department of Health Services; 
Section NR 811.39(2)(c), Wisconsin Administrative Code, contains chemical feeder design requirements, including allowable chemical feeder settings; and 
Section NR 811.40(1)(d), Wisconsin Administrative Code, contains chemical feed storage tank requirements, including maximum solution tank sizes.   
§ 187-77.  Recommended levels.

The Village of Holmen Water Utility shall fluoridate in accordance with the recommended levels as follows: 

Effective as of February 1, 2013, the Department of Health Services recommended the optimal level of fluoride for public water systems be 0.70 mg/l. To ensure public water systems are consistently providing a fluoride level that has the greatest benefit, a recommended fluoride concentration control range had to be established. Following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is recommended that Wisconsin public water systems: 
(1)    Have an average monthly fluoride concentration of at least 0.70 mg/l; 

(2)    Have 75% of daily samples within the recommended control range of 0.60 mg/l to 0.80 mg/l; 

(3)    Submit monthly split samples to the state lab for testing that correlate with a split tolerance of +/- 0.20 mg/l; and 

(4)    Continue fluoridation of the public water supply (PWS) unless the system has natural fluoride levels of 0.60 mg/l or above.     

§ 187-78.  Changes to requirements or recommended levels.

Should the above-referenced agencies, at any time in the future, effectively adopt changes to the requirements or recommended levels listed herein, the Village of Holmen Water Utility shall immediately abide by those new parameters, and this article shall be immediately amended to reflect such.

§ 195-7.  Zoning Map; district boundaries. 

The revised Official Zoning Map is an integral part of this chapter. A copy of this map titled "Zoning Map, Holmen, Wisconsin," together with a copy of this chapter, shall be available in the Village Clerk's office for public inspection during office hours. Any changes in zoning district boundaries shall be recorded on the map. 
The district boundaries are either streets or alleys unless otherwise shown, and where the designation on the map indicates that the various districts are approximately bounded by a street or alley line, such street or alley line shall be construed to be the district boundary line. 
Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lot lines, and where the designations on the map are approximately bounded by lot lines, said lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of the district. 
In unsubdivided property, the district boundary shown on the map shall be determined by township or range line, 1/4 sections, and divisions thereof, property lines, by scale, or by dimensions shown on said map.   
§ 195-8.  General regulations.

Excepted as otherwise provided: 

Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(1)    Present uses of buildings and premises may be continued even though they do not conform to the restrictions of this chapter. However, structural repairs or alternations of such buildings or premises shall not exceed 50% of their assessed value at the time they become nonconforming unless a building or premises conforming to this chapter results. Any nonconforming use that is abandoned for one year shall be discontinued permanently. 

(2)    Existing nonconforming uses.  

(a)     The lawful nonconforming use of a structure, land or water existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be continued although the use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter; however, only the portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued, and the structure may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter.   

(b)     Total lifetime structural repairs or alterations shall not exceed 50% of the municipality's current assessed value of the structure at the time of its becoming a nonconforming use unless it is permanently changed to conform to the use provisions of this chapter.  

(c)     Substitutions of new equipment may be permitted by the Board of Appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring uses.   

(3)    Abolishment or replacement. If such nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 months, any future use of the structure, land or water shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. When a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than 50% of its current assessed value, it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this chapter. 

(4)    Existing nonconforming structures.  

(a)     A lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be continued although its size or location does not conform to the lot width, lot area, yard, height, setback, parking and loading and access provisions of this chapter.  

(b)     Additions and enlargements to existing nonconforming structures are permitted and shall conform to the required building setback lines along streets, water and highways and the yard, height, parking, loading and access provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this section with respect to additions or enlargements are applicable only if the lot or parcel conforms to the existing sanitary code requirements or is serviced by a public sanitary sewer.  

(c)     Existing nonconforming structures which are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood or other calamity may be reconstructed and insofar as is practicable shall conform to the required building setback lines along streets and highways and the yard, height, parking, loading and access provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this section with respect to reconstruction are applicable only if the lot or parcel conforms to the existing sanitary code requirements or is serviced by a public sanitary sewer.  

(d)     Existing nonconforming structures may be moved and insofar as is practicable shall conform to the required building setback lines along streets or highways and the yard, height, parking, loading and access provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this section with respect to moving are applicable only if the lot or parcel conforms to the existing sanitary code requirements or is serviced by a public sanitary sewer.   

(5)    Changes and substitutions. Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform it shall not revert to a nonconforming use or structure. Once the Board of Appeals has permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use the substituted use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and become subject to all the conditions required by the Board of Appeals.   

Amendments. 
(1)    Authority. Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 61.35 and 62.23(7) of the Wisconsin Statutes the Village Board may, after notice and public hearing as hereinafter provided, amend the regulation of this chapter or change the district boundaries.

(9)    Draining and approval thereof. No private swimming pool shall be constructed so as to allow water therefrom to drain into any sanitary sewer nor to overflow upon or cause damage to any adjoining property. Provisions may be made for draining the contents of any swimming pool into a storm sewer, but such installation shall be subject to prior approval by the Director of Public Works. 

(10)  Filter system required. All private swimming pools within the meaning of this chapter, must have, in connection therewith, some filtration system to assure proper circulation of the water therein and maintenance of the proper bacterial quality thereof.

(1)    Fences defined. For the purpose of this subsection, a "fence" is herein defined as a barrier consisting of vegetation, wood, stone, vinyl, brick, fieldstone, wrought iron, or metal intended to prevent ingress or egress. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "fence" shall include plantings, such as hedges and shrubbery in the front yard. No fence shall be constructed of unsightly or dangerous materials which would constitute a nuisance.  

(a)     Fences to be situated in side and/or rear yards shall be constructed using materials suitable for residential-style fencing, including, but not limited to, brick, fieldstone, wrought iron, vinyl, chain link (with a minimum thickness of nine gauge and a required top rail support), stockade or board-on-board wood.  

(b)     No fence shall be constructed of used or discarded materials in disrepair, including, but not limited to, pallets, tree trunks, trash, tires, junk, or other similar items. Materials not specifically manufactured for fencing, such as, but not limited to, railroad ties, doors, landscape timbers or utility poles, shall not be used for or in the construction of a fence.  

(c)     Agricultural/farm fences shall only be permitted in agriculturally zoned or used districts and can only exceed six feet with a conditional use permit.  

(d)     Fences associated with baseball and/or softball fields and surrounding tennis courts may be erected in conformance with accepted industry standards. A fence permit shall be required for such installation.   

(2)    Fences categorized. Fences shall be categorized into six classifications:  

(a)     Boundary fence: a fence placed on or within three feet of the property lines of adjacent properties.  

(b)     Protective fence: a fence constructed to enclose a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare.  

(c)     Architectural or aesthetic fence: a fence constructed to enhance the appearance of the structure or the landscape.

(e)     Picket fence: a fence having a pointed post, stake, pale or peg laced vertically with the point or sharp part pointing upward to form a part of the fence.  

(f)     Dog kennel fence: A chain-link enclosure which is enclosed on three or four sides in the side or rear yard of a property.   

(3)    Height and setback of fences regulated.  

(a)     Residential fences are permitted up to the property lines in residential districts but shall not, in any case, exceed a height of six feet in the rear and side yards, shall not exceed four feet in height in the front yard, shall not exceed four feet in height from grade in the front, side, or rear yard setback abutting a public sidewalk, shall not encroach into any vision corner and shall not be closer than three feet to any public right-of-way along a public alley. The height of any fence shall be measured as an average and shall not include the posts or pillars to which a fence is attached.  

[1]    Decorative wrought iron, brick, stone, PVC or painted picket-style fences less than 48 inches (average) in height from grade or decorative lot corner landscape may be placed up to the property line in residential districts and shall not violate vision corner ordinances.  

[2]    Chain-link and unpainted/unstained fencing is not permitted in residential front, side or rear yards abutting a public sidewalk.  

[3]    A fence located in an interior side yard between dwellings shall not exceed four feet in height. However, a fence may be erected to a height of six feet if the entire fence is constructed of wrought iron or similar open construction or if the area above four feet is at least fifty-percent open. An example of the latter is a fence that is opaque to a height of four feet and is topped with not more than two feet of lattice. Any interior side yard fence may be erected to a height of six feet if it is located more than 10 feet from the side wall of the adjacent neighboring dwelling.  

[4]    A fence located in a rear yard abutting a public sidewalk may be erected to a height of six feet if the entire fence is constructed of wrought iron or similar open construction or if the area above four feet is at least fifty-percent open. An example of the latter is a fence that is opaque to a height of four feet and is topped with not more than two feet of lattice.  

[5]    All fences must be constructed and maintained in a good state of repair and appearance. The finished side or decorative side of a fence shall face adjoining property.    

(b)     No fence, wall, hedge, or shrubbery shall be erected, placed, maintained or grown along a lot line on any nonresidentially zoned property, adjacent to a residentially zoned property, to a height exceeding eight feet.  

(c)     Property owners shall locate fences no closer than three feet from the property line so that each side of the fence may be properly maintained by the owner of the fence while on said owner's property, unless an affidavit in recordable form is provided signed by the adjacent property owner agreeing to maintain the opposite side of the fence or agreeing to permit the owner of the fence to maintain said fence. This requirement can be waived if a maintenance-free fence is installed.  

(d)     In the case of a proposed fence installation within three feet of a lot line where no record of a fence existed, a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer is required to obtain a fence permit. No survey is required if a recordable affidavit signed by all affected property owners establishing an agreed-upon lot line.   

(4)    Fences on nonresidential property. Fences are permitted on the property lines, following approval through site plan and architectural review per Article XVI of the Village Code,[1] in all commercial and industrial zoning districts but in no case shall not exceed a maximum of eight feet in height in commercial zoning districts and 10 feet in height in industrial districts. Ultimately, all fence materials, heights and locations shall be determined through the processes outlined in Article XVI. 

(5)    Prohibited fences. No fence shall be constructed which is in a dangerous condition or which conducts electricity or is designed to electrically shock or which uses barbed wire; provided, however, that barbed wire may be used exclusively in industrially zoned areas with a conditional use permit, only if the devices securing the barbed wire to the fence are no more than 10 feet above grade and project toward the fenced property and away from public area.  

(a)     No person shall construct or install:  

[1]    Any wire or chain-link-type fence with the cut or salvage end of the fence exposed at the top.

[3]    An incomplete fence, consisting only of posts and supporting members.  

[4]    A fence on a vacant lot or parcel.     

(6)    Fences to be repaired. All fences shall be maintained and kept safe and in a state of good repair, and the finished side or decorative side of a fence shall face adjoining property. 

(7)    Temporary fences. Fences erected for the protection of planting or to warn of construction hazard, or for similar purposes, shall be clearly visible or marked with colored streamers or other such warning devices at four-foot intervals. Such fence shall comply with the setback requirements set forth in this subsection. The issuance of a permit shall not be necessary for temporary fences as described herein, but said fences shall not be erected for more than 45 days or, in the case of a construction project, shall only be for the duration of said construction project. 

(8)    Nonconforming fences and hedges. Any fence or hedge existing on the effective date of this Code of Ordinances shall not be modified, enlarged, extended or replaced, except in strict compliance with all of the requirements of this subsection. The replacement of a nonconforming fence as to height, setbacks (vision corner requirements shall still be met), or fence material type may be made, provided that the fence material be the same or higher grade as outlined below:

(9)    Fences required under conditional use permits. An opaque fence of six feet in height may be required on property for which a conditional use permit is granted in those cases in which such a fence is determined to be beneficial to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or adjoining property owners. Such fence shall comply with material requirements as specified hereunder.  

(10)  Permit required. A Village of Holmen fence permit is required for any newly installed fence or for a total fence replacement. A fence permit fee shall be paid at the rate established in the annual Fee Schedule. Commercial, industrial or multifamily fences must adhere to Article XVI of the Village Code.[2]  

(11)  Vision clearance. No fence, structure, post, pillar or object of natural growth shall hereafter be maintained or allowed to grow higher in the vision clearance area than 36 inches above the highest grade of the adjacent sidewalk or the required sidewalk grade where no sidewalk exists. This provision shall likewise apply to alley vision clearance areas.  

(a)     The requirement of vision clearance shall not apply at a height of six feet or more above the highest grade of the adjacent sidewalk or the required sidewalk grade where no sidewalk exists.  

(b)     Objects of narrow width, which do not exceed 10 inches in diameter, which do not impair corner vision, may at the discretion of the Inspection Department be permitted in the vision clearance area.  

(c)     Right-of-way. All permanent fences shall be located outside the public right-of-way.  

(d)     Public nuisance. Obstruction to visual clearance, as regulated by this subsection, shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and the Inspection Department, Police Department and Village Attorney are authorized to abate said nuisance and to enforce penalties in accordance with § 195-53 of the Village Code.    

(12)  Obstruction of ingress/egress area of a dwelling. No fence shall be installed in any yard that will shield any window or opening in a habitable space of a dwelling. A minimum distance of six feet shall be maintained between any solid fence and any such window or opening in a dwelling.

Planned Unit Developments

[Amended 8-11-2011 by Ord. No. 3.11; 7-14-2016 by Ord. No. 9-2016]

§ 195-24.  Purpose.

The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is established to allow for variation from the use and dimensional standards defined by other zoning districts when an area of land is developed as a cohesive unit, while insuring substantial compliance to the basic intent of the Zoning Ordinance and adopted plans. This chapter defines the process by which unique standards can be established for each planned unit development. 

§ 195-25.  Uses.

Any use permitted by right or as a conditional grant in any of the other districts of this chapter may be permitted in the Planned Unit Development District; provided, however, that no use shall be permitted except in conformity with an approved final development and implementation plan pursuant to the procedural and regulatory provisions established by this chapter. Additionally, the Planned Unit Development District may also be used as a simple zoning overlay for any other district of this chapter for the specific purpose of modifying minor or subtle zoning requirements such as, but not limited to, setback requirements, height requirements, lot size requirements and density requirements; provided, however, that the zoning overlay shall still conform to the permitted and conditional use requirements of the underlying district. 

§ 195-26.  (Reserved) 

§ 195-26.1.  Lot size; yard; bulk regulations.

In the Planned Unit Development District, there shall be no predetermined specific lot area, lot width, height, yard and usable open space requirements, but such requirements as are made a part of an approved final development and implementation plan, and shall be construed to be and enforced as a part of this chapter. 

§ 195-26.2.  Signs.

Signs may be provided in accordance with Article XII of the Village of Holmen Zoning Ordinance and such requirements as are made a part of an approved final development and implementation plan. 

§ 195-26.3.  Off-street parking and loading.

In the Planned Unit Development District, off-street parking facilities shall be provided in accordance with this Zoning Ordinance and such requirements as are made a part of an approved final development and implementation plan. 

§ 195-27.  Procedure. 

The procedure for rezoning to a Planned Unit Development (PUD) District (including use as a zoning overlay) shall be as required for any other Zoning Map amendment under this chapter, except that in addition thereto the rezoning may only be considered in conjunction with a general development plan subject to specific criteria, that may be required by the Village Administrator. 
Preapplication conference. 
(1)    A developer desiring to obtain zoning to construct a planned unit development may request a preapplication conference with the Planning Commission prior to submitting an application for the zoning. 

(2)    The purpose of this preapplication conference shall be to familiarize both the developer and the Planning Commission with each other's intentions with respect to the planned unit development. Although a preapplication conference shall not be required, this preliminary meeting between the Planning Commission and the developer is desirable since it should help clarify many procedural and policy issues. 

(3)    The developer shall not be required to present any written or graphic materials at the preapplication conference. The Planning Commission cannot approve zoning at the preapplication conference.   

General development plan. A general development plan application shall be submitted with the rezoning petition and shall include written, quantitative and graphic materials, as may be required by the Village Administrator (a larger and more complex PUD should expect to submit more application materials, whereas certain application materials may not apply or may not be necessary for a smaller and more simplified PUD): 
(1)    Written materials that the Village Administrator may require include, but shall not be limited to, the following:  

(a)     Legal description of the total development parcel proposed for development, including exact location and a statement of present and proposed ownership.  

(b)     Statement of development concept, including the planning objectives and the character of the development to be achieved through the planned unit development.  

(c)     Development schedule indicating the appropriate date when construction of the planned unit development can be expected to begin and to be completed, including initiation and completion dates of separate stages of a phased development.  

(d)     Statement of intentions regarding the future selling or leasing of all or portions of the planned unit development, such as land areas, dwelling units and public facilities.  

(e)     The impact of the development on existing Village services outside the development.   

(2)    Quantitative data that the Village Administrator may require include, but shall not be limited to, the following:  

(a)     Parcel size.  

(b)     Proposed lot coverage of structures.  

(c)     Total amount of usable open space, both private and public.  

(d)     Total number and type of dwelling units by number of bedrooms.  

(e)     Approximate gross residential densities.  

(f)     Number of parking spaces to be provided.  

(g)     Total length of streets to be conveyed to the Village government.  

(h)     Total length of streets to be held as private ways within the development.

(a)     Map of existing site conditions, including contours, watercourses, floodplains, unique natural features, existing vegetation and existing buildings.  

(b)     Existing and proposed lot lines.  

(c)     Location and size of gross floor area of all existing and proposed buildings, structures and other improvements, including maximum heights and types of dwelling units.

(e)     The existing and proposed circulation, including off-street parking areas, services areas, loading areas and all points of access to existing public rights-of-way.  

(f)     Proposed pedestrian circulation system.  

(g)     Existing and proposed utility systems.     

Referral and hearing. 
(1)    The general development plan application containing all of the information required by the Village Administrator shall be filed with the Village Administrator, who shall forward the application to the Planning Commission. 

(2)    Hearing requirement. As with any Zoning Map amendment, no such amendments shall be made without a hearing before the Planning Commission. 

(3)    Following public hearing the Planning Commission shall forward the general development plan petition to the Village Board, with a recommendation that the plan be approved as submitted, approved with modifications, or disapproved. The Village Board may consider the general development plan accordingly, and too may modify any aspect of the petition before rendering a final recorded approval. 

(4)    Approval of the rezoning and related general development plan shall establish the basic right of use for the area in conformity with the plan as approved, which shall be recorded as an integral component of the district regulations, but such plan shall be conditioned upon approval of a final development and implementation plan, which shall include all required modifications from the recorded general development plan approval, and shall not make permissible any of the uses as proposed until the final development and implementation plan is submitted and approved for all or a portion of the general development plan.   

Criteria for approval of the general development plan. As a basis for determining the acceptability of a Planned Unit Development District application, the following criteria shall be considered: 
(1)    Conforms to the adopted Comprehensive Plan for the portion of the Village in which the Planned Unit Development District is located. 

(2)    Provides benefits to the Village which outweigh its adverse effects. In making this determination, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:  

(a)     Quality of site design, including integration of a variety of land uses, building types and densities, preservation of natural features, compatibility and adjacent land uses, provision and type of open spaces, and provision of other amenities designed to benefit the general public.  

(b)     Traffic flow and safety.  

(c)     Adequacy of utilities and other public works facilities.   

(3)    Implementation schedule. The proponents of a Planned Unit Development District shall submit a reasonable schedule for the implementation of the development to the satisfaction of the Village Board, including suitable provisions for assurance that each phase could be brought to completion in a manner which would not result in adverse effect upon the community as a result of termination at that point.   

Final development and implementation plan. The final development plan that includes all required modifications from the general development plan approval process, including input from the public hearing and the final decision of the Village Board and any final modifications to the plan that are necessary to address final engineering and site design, and a detailed plan for implementation of all or a part of the proposed Planned Unit Development District must be submitted within a reasonable period of time, as may be determined by the Village Board. If a final development and implementation plan has not been submitted within said time, which the Village Board determines to be a reasonable phase of the total plan, the Village Board may render the Planned Unit Development District void and the previous zoning district shall be reinstated. The final development and implementation plan shall be submitted to the Village Administrator and, in addition to the requirements of the approved general development plan, the Village Administrator may require additional detailed construction and engineering plans and related detailed documents and schedules, including but not limited to: 
(1)    An accurate map of the area covered by the plan, including the relationship to the total general development plan. 

(2)    The pattern of public and private roads, driveways, walkways and parking facilities.

(12)  A development schedule indicating the:  

(a)     Approximate date when construction of the project can be expected to begin;  

(b)     Stages in which the project will be built and the approximate date when construction of each stage can be expected to begin;  

(c)     Anticipated rate of development;  

(d)     Approximate date when the development of each of the stages will be completed.    

(13)  Agreements, bylaws, provision or covenants which govern the organizational structure, use, maintenance, and continued protection of the planned unit development and any of its common services, common open areas or other facilities.  

(14)  A final plat of the lands to be subdivided as part of the specific implementation plan, suitable for recording.  

(15)  Any other plans, documents or schedules requested by the Village.   

Approval of the final development and implementation plan. 
(1)    Following a review of the final development and implementation plan, the Planning Commission shall recommend to the Village Board that it be approved as submitted, approved with modifications or disapproved. 

(2)    Upon receipt of the Planning Commission recommendations, the Village Board may approve or further modify and approve the plan and authorize development to proceed accordingly or disapprove the plan and send it back to the Planning Commission for further negotiation with the developer. 

(3)    The developer must build in accordance to the parameters of the final development and implementation plan as adopted and recorded by the Village Board. During the course of construction of an approved Planned Unit Development, the Village Administrator, or if referred to, the Planning Commission, may permit minor modifications to the final development and implementation plan, as long as those minor modifications are not in conflict with the overall intent and purpose of the final development and implementation plan. For example, these modifications may include slight variations in building materials and colors, or in tree and plant species, if the applicant can, for example, demonstrate that the preferred choices were not available or that other similar looking options are more cost effective, etc.; these modifications may also include slight variations to the site plan, utility plans or public or other infrastructure plans if the applicant, for example, can demonstrate that the plan as approved is not feasible due to unforeseen circumstances, etc.; these modifications may also include slight variations to the implementation schedule if the applicant, for example, can demonstrate a hardship that impacts the timing of the development. Any substantial alteration or change or addition to the approved final development and implementation plan or use, however, shall be required to follow the procedure for a general development plan and PUD rezoning as described in this article.

(b)     EVM signs shall be located only on single-user lots.  

(c)     A maximum of one EVM sign shall be permitted per zoning lot; the sign shall be placed along the approved corridor frontage only.

(d)     EVM signs shall be equipped with photosensitive equipment which automatically adjusts the brightness and contrast of the sign in direct relation to the ambient outdoor illumination (This capability shall exist independent of scheduled dimming by use of software.) such that the light level does not exceed 0.3 footcandle above ambient light, as measured using a footcandle meter at a preset distance depending on sign size. Measuring distance shall be calculated as follows: the square root of the product of the total EVM sign area multiplied by 100. (Example using a twelve-square-foot sign: SYMBOL(12 x 100) = 34.6 feet measuring distance).  

(e)     Messaging that violates the definition, and therefore the defined purpose of an EVM sign, shall be prohibited.  

(f)     EVM signs shall be maintained so as to be able to display messages in a complete and legible manner.   

(4)    Size. Excluding display of gas prices, the EVM sign portion of a freestanding sign shall not exceed 40% of the total sign area (square footage). 

(5)    EVM signs existing as of September 13, 2012.

(d)     No EVM sign or message shall create a hazard or dangerous distraction to vehicular traffic or a nuisance to adjoining residential property. (To avoid the creation of a hazard, dangerous distraction or potential nuisance due to the brightness and contrast of the sign, it is recommended that the skin be adjusted so that the brightness and contrast of the sign does not exceed 0.3 footcandle, above ambient light).     

Portable and temporary signs. 
(1)    Such signs shall be limited in use to 30 days at a time following approval by the Village, provided, however, that the Village shall not give approval for placement of a portable sign if it presents a vision obstruction, and it shall not be displayed more frequently than one time per year at any one location.

Site Plan and Architectural Review

[Added 5-10-2012 by Ord. No. 4-2012]

§ 195-65.  Establishment; purpose; membership.

There is hereby established a Site Plan and Architectural Review Board for the Village of Holmen, for the purpose of implementing the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan, promoting compatible developments, aesthetics, stability of property values and preventing impairment or depreciation of existing developments. The Site Plan and Architectural Review (SPAR) Board shall consist of the seven members of the Village of Holmen Planning Commission, as appointed by the Village President, subject to confirmation by the Village Board. The Planning Commission, when operating and acting as the SPAR Board, shall operate in accordance with the provisions of this article. No commercial (business), industrial (manufacturing), multifamily (defined as three or more residential units), or institutional structure (public or private) shall be erected, moved, reconstructed, extended or have its exterior altered or changed without the SPAR Board's approval. Very small accessory structures (i.e., fences, very small signs, etc.) and very minor exterior alterations may be exempted by the Administrator or his designee from SPAR Board review; however the Administrator or his designee may at any time request a determination by the SPAR Board. 

§ 195-66.  Powers.

The Planning Commission, operating and acting as the SPAR Board, shall have the power to: 

Hear and decide development applications for building plans and site plans, for permission to erect, move, reconstruct, extend, alter or change the exterior, landscape, location of HVAC and utilities, signage and lighting for all commercial, industrial, multifamily and institutional uses. 
Direct architectural design to conform to a particular form and style, as specified in applicable sections of the Comprehensive Plan and of the Zoning Code (such as overlay districts, or areas requiring design sensitivity, i.e., when in close proximity to highways, the central Village core and residential development). 
Require more restrictive or stringent standards than those of the zoning district in which the development is located so as to meet the intent to this article and the goals of the Comprehensive Plan. 
Approve, deny or conditionally approve the application and may request such modifications as it may deem necessary to carry out the purpose of this article. 
Request assistance from other municipal officers, departments, boards and commissions. 
Request the applicant to furnish additional information. 
Hear and decide on applications for building and/or occupancy permits pertaining to significant historic structures, sites or features.   
§ 195-67.  Principles.

To implement and define criteria for implementing the goals and the purposes set forth in the Village's Comprehensive Plan, the following principles are established: 

No building or sign, the design or exterior appearance of which is of such unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to its surroundings as to be unsightly or offensive to generally accepted taste and community standards, shall be permitted. 
No building or sign, the design or exterior appearance of which is so similar to those within reasonable proximity as to create excessive monotony or drabness, shall be permitted. 
No building or sign where any exposed facade is constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically incompatible with the other facades and which presents an unattractive appearance to the public and to surrounding properties shall be permitted. 
No building or sign shall be permitted to be sited on the property in a manner which would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the natural beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in that area; or which would unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the beauty and general enjoyment of existing structures on adjoining properties. 
Development and redevelopment shall be consistent with the public goals, objectives, principles, standards, policies and design guidelines set forth in the adopted Village Comprehensive Plan or components thereof to accomplish the creation of the Village's visual identity. 
The use or uses proposed in the development must be either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district in which the development is located. 
Any accessory use or uses proposed in the development shall conform to the allowable accessory uses in the zoning district in which the development is located. 
All submitted plans shall at a minimum conform to all other applicable standards of the Village Municipal Code.   
§ 195-68.  Design guidelines.

The following design guidelines are established for all development applications for commercial, industrial, multifamily and institutional uses: 

Building design. 
(1)    Architectural style is not restricted; however, structures shall be consistent or compatible with the surrounding area. Compatibility may be achieved through the use of various visual architectural elements, such as similar rooflines, building orientations, forms/shapes, proportions (scale and mass), door and window patterns (fenestration), textures, materials, colors and other architectural detailing. Building lighting, signage and mechanical equipment also shall be presented as an integral part of the building design and shall not detract from the architectural style of the building. 

(2)    The composition of major building elements, such as massing, rooflines, colors and material shall complement and contribute to a desirable community identity. 

(3)    Colors shall be harmonious and relate to the overall site and to the Village as a whole. Bright complementary colors may be used for highlighting purposes (accenting), provided that such colors do not overbear the integrity of the building facade. 

(4)    Rooftop mechanical equipment, trash/dumpster areas, and other utility hardware located on the site shall be screened from public view with building and landscape material or be located in a manner that is unobtrusive. 

(5)    No rows of garage doors for multifamily uses and no overhead service doors or loading docks shall face a public street. The SPAR Board may allow such features to face a public street when it finds that there is no feasible alternative orientation for such doors or docks and, insofar as is practicable, such doors and docks facing public streets are to be screened with landscaping and/or softened by architectural detailing. 

(6)    Accessory buildings and structures shall be compatible with the principal building in terms of building facade character, roof shapes, materials, colors and architectural details.   

Exterior building materials. 
(1)    Materials shall be consistent or compatible with the architectural character of the Village and shall be consistent with the surrounding area. Where the proposed materials are dissimilar to prevailing materials used on existing buildings in the area, other characteristics such as form, proportion, texture, color and detailing shall be utilized to ensure that adequate similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the use of different materials. 

(2)    Materials shall be of durable quality. 

(3)    The facades of buildings shall be finished with an aesthetically pleasing material(s), such as natural or cultured stone, brick, wood, glass panels, or ornate masonry materials, except where the building style requires a different material. No plain concrete-block or plain concrete-panel buildings or smooth or corrugated metal-faced buildings that are devoid of an architectural merit or character, except those with an attractive finished surface listed above, may be allowed. 

(4)    Building facades clad with a single exterior surface material shall provide some additional architectural design elements to break up the plane of large faceless and/or nondescript walls. This may be achieved by architectural design treatments consistent with the principal building design.   

Lighting standards. 
(1)    All exterior parking areas must be illuminated. 

(2)    Illuminating curb cuts and entrances to parking areas is encouraged. 

(3)    All exterior lighting shall be energy efficient and shall be located, oriented and of an intensity to illuminate only the building site or lot, where located, without detrimentally affecting activity on adjacent sites or lots or traffic on streets and highways. 

(4)    Lighting shall not be located on the roofs of buildings. Any lights affixed to a building shall be oriented downward at an angle from the vertical so as to light only areas of the site. 

(5)    Lights may not flash, pulsate, be so bright as to impair or hinder vision on public streets or adjacent building sites, or otherwise constitute a nuisance. 

(6)    Mixing of lighting types (i.e., sodium vapor, incandescent, mercury vapor and metal halide) shall be avoided. 

(7)    Integration of similar lighting fixtures is encouraged. 

(8)    Exterior lighting shall not shine on or adversely impact neighboring properties or streets. 

(9)    Exterior lighting components, such as fixtures, standards and exposed accessories, should be consistent with the overall site design.  

(10)  The height of exterior lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the scale of adjacent buildings.   

Landscaping. 
(1)    Landscape design shall be integrated with the overall site plan and not be considered merely as an afterthought. Interesting or creative landscape architectural designs that use a diverse variety of plants integrated with other landscaping materials or features should be provided to avoid uncreative and monotonous landscaping. 

(2)    Landscape plans shall be well-planned and effective in the following areas: along street frontages, within and around paved parking areas and within buffer yards as screening for adjoining properties. 

(3)    Terrace/street trees shall be planted to provide a street frontage buffer. 

(4)    Paved parking areas shall be landscaped in order to minimize the impact of large expanses of pavement. Large paved areas shall include well-designed landscape islands. Planter islands shall contain trees and shrubs. Parking areas shall also be screened along the periphery to soften the impact for adjoining properties. Parking areas shall be curbed and control site stormwater. 

(5)    Landscaping shall be used to screen loading areas, dumpsters and mechanical equipment from public view; or they shall be located so as not to be visible from public ways. If landscaping materials are used, they shall form an immediate, solid and continuous screenl Solid fencing with landscaping as an accent may be necessary to totally screen loading areas, trash dumpster areas or mechanical equipment from view. 

(6)    Trees and shrubs shall not create blind spots along traffic ways for pedestrians or vehicular traffic. 

(7)    In addition to the minimum landscaping and greenspace required in the zoning district in which the development is located, the site plan and landscape plan shall provide suitable greenspace and landscaping to conform to the overall intent of this article's site plan and architectural review standards. 

(8)    Fences shall be constructed of material and shall be sized and located in a manner that shall complement the building and adjacent properties.   

Signage. 
(1)    Signs shall be consistent or compatible with the architectural character of the principal building and/or the surrounding area. 

(2)    Every sign shall be considered within its setting and designed according to the scale and proportions in which it will be viewed. 

(3)    The mass of an awning used as a sign shall not dominate the facade of the building to which it is attached. 

(4)    Freestanding signs shall be appropriately landscaped, however and whenever possible.     

§ 195-69.  Applications for review.

Applications for review by the SPAR Board shall be made to the Administrator and shall be accompanied by the following required documents that shall include and identify the exterior elevations of the existing and proposed structure, description of the proposed materials and color schemes, the overall site plan (also identifying loading areas, any outside storage and any accessary structures), the HVAC and utility locations, the parking plan, the landscaping plan, the stormwater plan, the signage plan, the lighting plan and when necessary a floor plan. 

Process. 
(1)    Applicants shall be responsible for all required submittal information. Applications that are considered incomplete shall not proceed to the SPAR Board for consideration. 

(2)    The Administrator or his designee shall determine if the application requires review, as a very small accessory structure or very minor exterior alteration may be exempted from this process. 

(3)    Should an application require SPAR Board review, the applicant is encouraged to work with Village staff to formalize a final application. Necessary Village departments shall review preliminary proposals and submit comments and recommendations to the applicant. At the request of the applicant or Village staff, and to expedite the process, a meeting or meetings may be held to discuss the review comments and recommendations toward creating a final application consistent with this article. 

(4)    Following preliminary discussions, and review of comments and recommendations, Village staff or the applicant may request a preliminary concept or feedback review from the Planning Commission; to informally review a specific part of or the concept of the total application. The applicant shall submit 12 plans or sets of plans (11 inches by 17 inches) to be reviewed, as requested by the Administrator, at least 10 full days prior to the Planning Commission meeting. Such discussion with the Planning Commission shall only be informational and shall not be considered a final review of the acting SPAR Board. 

(5)    Any resubmittal of plans submitted by the applicant in response to a preliminary review with staff or with the Planning Commission, shall be reviewed by Village staff within two weeks of resubmittal. 

(6)    Final review of application and appearance before the SPAR Board requires 12 complete sets (11 inches by 17 inches) of all revised and final documents as identified in this section. The applicant shall submit a complete formal application at least 10 full days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission (SPAR Board). 

(7)    Village staff shall review the formal submittal for compliance with the results of the preliminary review process and may present a final recommendation to the SPAR Board. 

(8)    The SPAR Board shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the formal review application within 60 days of submittal, or the process may be extended via written approval of the applicant. 

(9)    Where a rezoning of property is required, and the rezoning occurs concurrently with the site plan and architectural review process, this process may be adjusted to conform to the requirement of a public hearing at the plan commission level and review and consideration of the rezoning by the Village Board.  

(10)  The SPAR Board shall issue a decision, which shall be considered the final meeting for the application, and the decision shall be binding upon the applicant.     

§ 195-70.  Findings and modifications.

The SPAR Board shall not approve any application unless it finds that the purposes and guidelines set forth in this article have been reasonably met. In certain situations, the SPAR Board may allow modifications or grant exceptions to the guidelines set forth in this article on the basis of compelling architectural merit or where the strict application or adherence to established guidelines may be impractical or impossible due to site conditions or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 

§ 195-71.  Decision.

The SPAR Board shall hear and decide all applications during the regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission, and action on such decision shall be considered the final meeting for the application. In approving, approving with conditions or denial of a site plan and architectural review application, the SPAR Board shall state its findings toward approval or denial based on the intent and review criteria of this article. The findings of the SPAR Board shall be indicated in the minutes of its proceedings and shall be a public record. For those elements of an application that have been approved by the SPAR Board, building permits may be reasonably issued. After approval, it is the applicant's responsibility to apply for and submit required information for a building permit, separate from this site plan and architectural review process. 

§ 195-72.  Appeals.

Any person aggrieved by any decisions of the SPAR Board may appeal the decision to the Village's Zoning Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed with the Clerk within 30 days after filing of the decision with the Clerk. 

§ 195-73.  Violations and penalties.

Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be required to forfeit not less than $50 nor more than $500, plus costs, for each violation. Each consecutive day in which the violation has not been remedied, shall be considered as a new violation subject to further penalty, up to a maximum of $5,000. 

§ 195-74.  Severability.

The provisions of this article are severable. If any provision of this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional or if the application of any provision of this article to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such holding shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this article which can be given effect without the valid or unconstitutional provisions or applications. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the Village Board that this article would have been adopted had any invalid or unconstitutional provision or applications not been included herein.  

ARTICLE XVII

Landscaping and Bufferyards

[Added 12-14-2017 by Ord. No. 5-2017]

§ 195-75.  Purpose.

The purpose of this article is to establish landscaping requirements and other regulations intended to preserve and maintain vegetation in a manner that promotes the natural resource protection, high quality aesthetics, and public health goals of the Village. It is also the intent of this article to provide flexible requirements that encourage and allow for creativity in landscape design. 

§ 195-76.  Applicability. 

The requirements of this article shall not apply retroactively to existing buildings, structures, or paved areas, including requirements for bufferyards. 
Any use, except for those listed under Subsection E, shall provide landscaping in accordance with the regulations of this article, including new construction and expansion activities which add impervious surface (e.g., expansion of existing buildings, structures and parking lots). 
Additional landscaping requirements may be specified by the Zoning Administrator and/or Site Plan and Architectural Review Board (SPAR Board) to meet the intent of the Village's Comprehensive Plan. 
Where insufficient site area remains to comply with all provisions of this section, the Village may require compliance to the extent practical. 
Single family, two-family, and agricultural land uses are exempt from landscaping requirements.   
§ 195-77.  Landscaping plan and design standards. 

The applicant shall provide a landscaping plan prepared by a landscape architect, depicting the following: 
(1)    Plan shall be drawn at a reasonable scale to clearly delineate the landscape improvements and shall include a north arrow, property lines, and easements. 

(2)    Zoning of the subject property and abutting properties. 

(3)    Linear feet of the new/expanded building foundation and street frontage. 

(4)    Square footage of the total lot and new/expanded paved area. 

(5)    Existing landscaping to be removed. 

(6)    Existing landscaping to remain including type/name, size, number, and number of landscaping points per Figure 195.78 doubled.[15] 

(7)    Proposed landscaping meeting the requirements of this article including type/name, size, number, and number of landscaping points per Figure 195.78.   

Plant and groundcover material. 
(1)    Plant materials provided in conformance of the provisions of this section shall be of nursery quality and tolerant of individual site microclimates. 

(2)    Mulch is encouraged to consist of shredded bark or chipped wood or other organic material. Landscape stone mulch is discouraged. 

(3)    Mulches shall be installed so that they will not erode, fall, be plowed or otherwise transported into walks, drives, streets or other hard surfaced portions of the site.   

Parking lot design. 
(1)    Parking spaces must be broken by a tree island at the rate of one island for each linear row of 20 parking spaces. 

(2)    All tree islands and landscaped areas with trees shall have a minimum width of eight feet as measured from outside the curb or frame. 

(3)    All landscaped areas without trees, but planted with shrubs, shall have a minimum width of three feet measured from inside the curb or frame. 

(4)    Parking lots adjacent to residential properties shall provide opaque screening of vehicle lights to a minimum height of four feet. Screening devices may include a fence, berm, and/or evergreen trees.   

Landscaping locations. 
(1)    Landscaping shall be distributed throughout the property, along street frontages, within parking lot interiors, and as foundation plantings as specified in this article. 

(2)    Unless meeting the requirements in Subsection (3) below, landscaping shall not be located within a public right-of-way, and shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. 

(3)    The Village may require the street frontage landscaping to be placed within the right-of-way and shall collect fees to purchase and install such landscaping.   

Use of required bufferyard and landscaped areas. 
(1)    Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian and bike trails provided: 1) no required material is eliminated; 2) the total width of the required bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is maintained; and 3) all other regulations of this chapter are met. 

(2)    No active recreational uses (e.g., swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, etc.), parking areas, buildings, outdoor light fixtures and outdoor display areas shall be permitted in required bufferyards and landscaped areas. 

(3)    Paving in such areas shall be limited to that required for necessary access to, through, or across the subject property.   

Other green space areas. 
(1)    Green space areas not used for landscape plantings, excluding natural resource protection areas, shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable seed mix, restored to native vegetation, or maintained in crop production (if approved by the Plan Commission).     

§ 195-78.  Landscaping points.

This section shall be used to establish the points per plant species and type, as described below and in Figure 195.78. See §§ 195-79 and 195-80 for landscaping requirements by zoning district. See § 195-86 for prohibited plant species and § 195-87 for points by permitted plant species.  

In calculating the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this section, all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this section shall be rounded up to the next whole plant (e.g., 23.3 rounds up to 24). 
In the case of building/paving expansion, only the new portion is required to provide landscaping. This is calculated by taking the square footage of the addition divided by the square footage of the existing building/paving area. This percent increase shall be used to dictate meeting the requirements of this article. 
The installation of a rain garden or bioswale may count toward meeting the Village's yard area, building foundation, and/or paved area landscaping point requirement based on 20 points for every 20 square feet, provided the requirements of § 195-81 are met. 
Landscaping point values shall be doubled for mature existing tree plantings that are retained and protected with the development of the site, except for those listed on the prohibited plant species list (see § 195-86). The preserved tree shall be protected during construction through the use of a fence around the drip line. If any preserved trees are lost to damage or disease within three years after plan approval, the owner shall replace said trees with the number of trees that would otherwise have been required. 
Landscaping materials, fences and berms located within a duly recorded utility or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a landscaping requirement, unless authorized otherwise by the Village. The width of such area(s) may be counted as part of a landscaping requirement.

§ 195-79.  Landscaping distribution requirements, excluding bufferyards.

Landscaping shall be provided based on the following requirements for building foundations, paved areas, street frontages, and yard areas (summarized in Figure 195.79A and illustrated in Figure 195.79B). These requirements are additive to each other and any other landscaping or screening requirements in this article, specifically bufferyard requirements (see § 195-80).

    


Figure 195.79A: Landscaping Requirements for Regular Development          

  

             

    

Building foundations. 
(1)    For every 100 linear feet of building foundation, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 195.78.[16] 

(2)    Building foundation landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the building foundation. 

(3)    Tall trees shall not be used to meet building foundation landscaping requirements.   

Paved areas. 
(1)    For every 20 off-street parking stalls, landscaping shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 195.78. 

(2)    Paved area landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the paved area. Said area does not have to be provided in one contiguous area. 

(3)    Plants used to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking, loading and circulation areas from view from public streets. 

(4)    A minimum of 30% of all points shall be devoted to medium or tall trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum of 40% of all points shall be devoted to shrubs.   

Street frontages. 
(1)    For every 100 linear feet of street frontage of a developed lot abutting a public street right-of-way, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 195.78. 

(2)    Street frontage landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the public street right-of-way. 

(3)    Shrubs shall not be used to meet street frontage landscaping requirements. A minimum of 50% of all points shall be devoted to decorative or medium trees, or a combination of such trees.   

Yard areas. 
(1)    For every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 195.78. 

(2)    The intent of this section is to provide yard shade and to require a visual screen of a minimum of six feet in height for all detached exterior appurtenances (such as HVAC, utility boxes, standpipes, stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes). 

(3)    Landscaping required by this section is most effective if located away from those areas required for landscaping as building foundations, street frontages, paved areas, protected green space areas, or reforestation areas. 

(4)    Up to 50% of the landscaping required by this section may be placed in the bufferyard to enhance the physical barrier between incompatible uses.

§ 195-80.  Bufferyards.

A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and/or fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances (e.g., dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings, or parking areas), between adjacent land uses. 

The required level of bufferyard opacity is listed in Figure 195-80A. Opacity is a quantitatively derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the abutting property. The required level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts.
     Figure 195.80A: Required bufferyard opacity values         

  

             

   

Bufferyards shall meet the minimum landscaping points defined in Figure 195.80B. Opacity levels (Figure 195.80A) are met by either installing the required minimum landscaping points with no buffering structure (no fence or berm), or installing a buffering structure (per minimum requirements in Figure 195.80B) at the identified reduced landscaping point requirement. See Figure 195-79B for an example of landscaping plan meeting all landscaping requirements.[17] 
(1)    Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another. Bufferyards shall not be required in front yards. 

(2)    Bufferyards are not required where additions to existing buildings or paved areas are not visible from adjacent properties eligible for buffering.  

(a)     For structures and parking additions parallel to or extending closer to an abutting property eligible for buffering, landscaping points shall be based on the linear frontage of the addition visible from abutting properties measured parallel along the property line.   

(3)    Bufferyard fencing shall be placed within the required or provided bufferyard along the perimeter of the abutting properties eligible for buffering. 

(4)    The visual screening for bufferyards, without a structural solid fence and required opacity of 0.4 or greater, shall have at least 50% of the required landscaping points be a combination of coniferous species, either shrubs or trees. 

(5)    Bufferyards shall meet the minimum width identified in Figure 195-80B, and shall be outside the identified paved area and building foundation planting zones per § 195-79A and B.  

(a)     Where the minimum permitted width for the required bufferyard is not available under the current state of development, the SPAR Board may reduce the width required for the bufferyard to that currently available on the site.

§ 195-81.  Rain gardens and bioswales.

Rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site, where appropriately designed and sited. 

Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings indicated: 
RAIN GARDEN — A shallow, depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground. Rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff. A well-designed and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for a development site.  

BIOSWALE — A linear, vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities. The flow of water being conveyed through a bioswale is slowed down, allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or off site. Water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it, generally improving both ground and surface water quality.  

Requirements. 
(1)    The installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for a development site and count toward meeting the Village's landscaping point requirements per § 195-78C. 

(2)    Detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden or bioswale including length, width, depth, and slope of depression; location of the rain garden or bioswale on the lot relative to hard-surfaced areas, downspouts, and site topography; characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale; description of planting media; the species, number, and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for the rain garden or bioswale; and information on any other materials (e.g., rocks) that will be used to line the rain garden or bioswale. 

(3)    Installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site:  

(a)     Areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale is proposed to be constructed with an underdrain;  

(b)     Areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground; or  

(c)     Areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic.   

(4)    The owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale will be properly maintained; kept free of trash, weeds, debris, and dead or dying plants; any pipes associated with the rain garden or bioswale shall be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris; and, by the beginning of every spring, dead plant materials shall be cut back or removed. 

(5)    Bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously (and appropriately) vegetated to qualify for landscaping points. Bioswales and rain gardens (or portions thereof) that are lined with turf and/or rocks but do not include other vegetation will not count toward meeting landscaping point requirements. 

(6)    Rain gardens and bioswales may serve as a component of an overall stormwater management plan for a site only if detailed plans, calculations, and specifications are submitted. Detailed plans shall include the location and description of all other stormwater management facilities serving the site, particularly those to which any bioswale will be directed.     

§ 195-82.  Installation and maintenance. 

Installation. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this article shall be installed on the subject property in accordance with the approved site plan within 365 days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property, unless a conditional use is approved to allow for greater than 365 days. 
Surety. 
(1)    If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the installation of all required landscaping and bufferyard material, the property owner shall sign an instrument agreeing to install the landscaping within the three-hundred-sixty-five-day period and shall furnish to the Village an irrevocable letter of credit or performance bond sufficient to guarantee completion of the work. Such security shall be provided by the property owner at the time that the agreement is signed. It shall be in an amount equal to 110% of the estimated actual cost for all of the required elements of the approved site plan and shall specifically guarantee that all such elements shall be made and installed according to the approved site plan. The costs of the work shall be furnished by the property owner and shall be verified by the Village. The financial security shall remain in force until all of the work has been completed and approved by the Village. Upon completion of the work and approval by the Village, the security shall be reduced to 10% of the original amount. The reduced security shall be held by the Village for 14 months following approval by the Village in order to provide a warranty for the work. This agreement shall also contain a statement indicating that the property owner's failure to comply with the requirements of the terms of the agreement will constitute a violation of the article and subject the property owner to any remedies available to the Village, including having the Village complete the work and withhold funds from the security to reimburse the Village for the work performed. 

(2)    If the required landscaping and bufferyard materials are to be installed during different phases of a subdivision development, the developer may furnish for each phase financial security in an amount sufficient to guarantee completion of the landscaping and bufferyard work performed during a particular phase, unless the land division regulations requires otherwise. 

(3)    If the property owner is a governmental unit, it may, in lieu of signing an agreement and furnishing a guarantee, file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act on its behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this article.   

All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless such vegetation is already fully established. 
The exact placement of plants and structures shall be depicted on the required detailed landscaping plan submitted to the Village for its approval. Such plant and structure location shall be the decision of each property owner, provided the following requirements are met: 
(1)    Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters to maximize their chance for survival. 

(2)    Where a combination of plant materials, berming, and fencing is used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward the interior of the subject property and the plant material shall be located toward the exterior of the subject property. 

(3)    A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the Register of Deeds, that an abutting property owner agrees to provide on the immediately abutting portion of his or her land a partial or full portion of the required bufferyard, thereby relieving the developer of the responsibility of providing the entire bufferyard on his property. 

(4)    Under no circumstance shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected or located in a manner resulting in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard. 

(5)    The restrictions on types of plants listed in this article shall apply.   

Maintenance. The continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall be a requirement of this article and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials and plants are required. This requirement shall run with the property and shall be binding upon all future property owners. Development of any or all property following the effective date of this article shall constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If the property owner fails to comply with these provisions, the Village may enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating and maintaining all required landscaping and bufferyard materials, and may specially assess the costs thereof against the property. A property owner's failure to comply with this requirement shall also be considered a violation of this article, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement procedures and penalties.   
§ 195-83.  Appeals.

Any person aggrieved by any decisions of the SPAR Board concerning this article may appeal the decision to the Village's Zoning Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed with the Clerk within 30 days after filing of the decision with the Clerk. 

§ 195-84.  Violations and penalties.

Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be required to forfeit not less than $50 nor more than $500, plus costs, for each violation. Each consecutive day in which the violation has not been remedied shall be considered as a new violation subject to further penalty, up to a maximum of $5,000. 

§ 195-85.  Findings and modifications. 

The SPAR Board shall not approve any application unless it finds that the purposes and regulations set forth in this article have been reasonably met. In certain situations, the SPAR Board may allow modifications or grant exceptions to these standards set forth in this article on the basis of compelling landscape architecture merit, or where the strict application or adherence to established standards may be impractical or impossible due to site conditions or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
The SPAR Board may, on a case-by-case basis, require more stringent regulations than the regulations listed within this article when deemed necessary by the Village to meet the purpose of this article and the purpose and intent of the Village's Zoning Code. 
The Zoning Officer may allow modifications to the approved landscaping plan during installation where the strict application or adherence to approved landscaping plan may be impractical or impossible due to site conditions (e.g., unknown utility infrastructure) or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.   
§ 195-86.  Prohibited plant species.

The purpose of this provision is to limit the planting of species that are invasive, have invasive tendencies, or that may perpetuate or spread disease. 

Prohibited species are listed in Figure 195.86 (below), and shall not be included as part of any landscaping plan. Protecting and retaining these prohibited plant species are exempt from receiving double points per § 195-78C.[18] 
        Figure 195.86: Prohibited Species            

     

             

     

§ 195-87.  Permitted plant species.

Species suitable for landscaping and compatible with local climate and soil factors are listed in Figures 195.87A through 195.87M.[19] However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and the Zoning Administrator shall review proposals for the applicability of species not listed, and is authorized to approve appropriate similar species and assign landscaping points to said similar species.

ARTICLE XVIII

Murals

[Added 9-12-2019 by Ord. No. 5-2019]

§ 195-88.  Rules and regulations. 

No person, nor business, nor entity of any kind, shall create or erect a mural in the Village of Holmen in conflict with this article. For the purposes of this article, a "mural" shall be defined as a painting or other work of art executed directly on a wall (typically of a building), or any other surface, viewable to the public in any manner. Proposed murals shall be regulated as follows: 
No mural may be erected on any building or surface or in any manner: 
(1)    In areas considered architecturally sensitive, such as the South Holmen Drive Corridor Area, the Seven Bridges Area, or any area that may be classified as architecturally sensitive in the future; and 

(2)    In areas that hold historic significance, such as, but not limited to, historic districts, or on buildings that hold historic architectural character or hold historic value to the community; and 

(3)    In any residential zoning district in the Village of Holmen; and 

(4)    That may be considered distracting or in any manner inappropriate or vulgar to the community at large, to protected classes or to motorists; and 

(5)    Containing any form of signage, copy-written material(s) or written message(s); and 

(6)    That does not, at a minimum, resonate images of some form of architectural or historic significance to the Holmen Community, such as the community's landscape, culture, evolution or overall identity; and 

(7)    That is not accompanied with a comprehensive plan for mitigating any impacts to the proposed immediate area, and a financial plan to ensure long-term maintenance and upkeep of the mural itself; and 

(8)    Without full written consent of the owner of the property where the mural is proposed, who shall be responsible for the long-term maintenance of the mural, subject to penalties and removal of the mural for failure to maintain the mural in good standing; and 

(9)    Without a conditional use permit, requiring a public hearing before the Village of Holmen Planning Commission, following a class two notice and notification to all property owners within 150 feet of the proposed mural location; and  

(10)  Without review and approval from the Village of Holmen Site Plan and Architectural Review (SPAR) Board pending the outcome of the public hearing and consideration of the above provisions.   

Preexisting murals (murals created before 2012) shall be grandfathered and are permitted to be maintained in full. Failure of any owner to maintain a preexisting mural shall be grounds for loss of the mural's grandfathered status, and subject to penalties and removal of the mural. Any modification or addition to any preexisting mural must abide by the provisions of this article.   
§ 195-89.  Violations and penalties.

Any person who violates Article XVIII shall, upon conviction thereof, be forced to remove any permitted or unpermitted mural, and forfeit not less than $500 nor more than $1,000, plus court costs.
