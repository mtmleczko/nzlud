Article I. Nonmetallic Mine Operator Licensing
[Adopted
7-7-2015
]
§ 56-1. Findings; purpose; authority.
Findings. Nonmetallic mining operations, while a component of our state and local economy, canhave both direct and indirect adverse impacts. Studies have documented that nonmetallic miningoperations can have adverse impacts on groundwater and surface water, and can generateadverse levels of light pollution, and harmful levels of dust and noise. Nonmetallic mining sites canhave negative impacts on the landscape and aesthetics if not properly screened, and can presentsafety concerns to members of the public if not properly secured. Truck traffic from suchoperations can also generate off-site impacts including road damage and safety concerns tochildren and other residents. While certain aspects of mining operations are subject to state orfederal regulation, there is no comprehensive state or federal regulation of nonmetallic miningoperations. Many aspects of nonmetallic mining operations are left unregulated with potentialadverse impacts to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Town.
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards for all nonmetallic miningoperations in the Town, and to require licenses for nonmetallic mining operators in order to protectpublic health and safety, to preserve the scenic beauty of the Town's landscapes and environment,to protect the public from damage to both the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters, tominimize or prevent adverse impacts from on-site and off-site operations, and to promote thegeneral welfare of the people and communities within the Town of Hudson.
Authority. This article is adopted by the powers granted to the Town of Hudson by the Town'sadoption of Village powers under §§ 60.10 and 61.34, Wis. Stats., its authority under § 66.0415,and other authority under the statutes. Any amendment, repeal or re-creation of the statutesrelating to this article made after the effective date of this article is incorporated into this article byreference on the effective date of the amendment, repeal or re-creation.
§ 56-2. Applicability and scope; exceptions.
This article shall apply to all nonmetallic mining operations and mine sites within the Town ofHudson except as set forth in Subsection
B
.
This article shall not apply to the following nonmetallic mining operations:
Excavations or grading by a person solely for domestic or farm use at that person's residenceor farm.
Excavations or grading conducted for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repairof a highway, railroad, or any other transportation facility where the excavation or grading isentirely within the property boundaries of the highway, railroad or other transportation facility.

Removal from the earth of products or commodities that contain only minor or incidentalamounts of nonmetallic minerals, such as commercial sod, agricultural crops, ornamental orgarden plants, forest products, Christmas trees or plant nursery stock.
Nonmetallic sand and gravel mines in operation prior to the enactment of this article shall notbe required to register or to apply for a license under this article, as long as said mineoperates under the original reclamation plan approved by the county, and the reclamationplan is not modified in any way. If the reclamation plan is modified, the mine is considered anew operation and is subject to the licensing requirements of this article. If an existingnonmetallic sand and gravel mine does not have a reclamation plan, any expansion of thatnonmetallic mine requires compliance with this article.

The Plan Commission and/or Town Board shall examine the design of roads and drivewayaccesses to assure that lots are laid out in a way that will produce intersections, grades andother features satisfying the following standards:
The number of intersections along arterial, collector and subcollector roads shall be heldto a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance between such intersections shall notbe less than 1,000 feet along these roads.
Road intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet on existing orproposed roads are not allowed.
Not more than two roads shall intersect at one point.
The intersection angle of a driveway access to a road, and a road to a road, shall not beless than 90° measured from the centerline of the road or driveway access to the right-of-way of the intersecting road or driveway access.
The Town requires road intersection vision clearances.
Subdivision roads shall provide connection to existing or planned road extensions andadjacent unplatted property.
All road layout design shall be consistent with any applicable policies adopted in the TownComprehensive Plan or official map.
Proposed roads or road rights-of-way shall extend to the boundary lines of the lot, parcel, orsite being subdivided or developed unless prevented by topography or other physicalconditions or unless the Plan Commission and/or Town Board determines that such extensionis not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the land division or for theadvantageous development of adjacent lands.
All arterial and collector roads shall be built to the boundary of the subdivision.
All road extensions shall be constructed at the time of the development's initial roadconstruction.
Temporary termination of roads intended to be extended at a later date shall be accomplishedwith the construction of a temporary T-shaped turnabout contained within the road right-of-
