PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Charleston, West Virginia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through May 21, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Charles Loeb, City Councilman, and Mr. Greg Burton, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed in this part is the city's Charter, being Acts 1929 (municipal charters), ch. 4, as approved by the governor on March 6, 1929, and effective on passage. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statute has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the copy of the Charter used in preparation of this part is the copy published in the city's 1975 Code. The editorial note for same states (in part) as follows: "Many section catchlines have been changed by the editors to more clearly and more fully indicate the contents of the sections and are not to be regarded as official; years have been changed from words to numerals; a uniform system of capitalization has been adopted; in some sections italicized words are printed in Roman; and words and figures have been supplied by the editors for the purpose of clarity." 
The editor's note for the Charter as published in the city's 1975 Code also states (in part) as follows: 
According to the West Virginia Blue Book, 1973, page 820, the community which is now Charleston was "originally chartered in 1794 as Charles Town--, [so] named by George Clendenin, one of the earliest settlers, for his father, Charles Clendenin." It became "Charleston" by Acts of Assembly 1817-18, ch. CXV, p. 160 et seq., passed January 19, 1818, which provided, in pertinent part, that "the town of Charles Town in the county of Kanawha, as the same has been heretofore laid off and the several acts of Assembly for that purpose-shall be, and the same is hereby erected into a town corporate, to be known as distinguished by the name of 'Charleston'--." These Acts were, of course, those of the general assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The first Act of the West Virginia legislature amending the town Charter was that of 1857, ch. 127, p. 1555; and Charleston became a city by Acts 1875, ch. 39, p. 47, which provided inter alia, for a common council consisting of a mayor, recorder and nine councilmen, a body politic by the name "The City of Charleston." 

Sec. 1. - Charleston made a city corporate and body politic. 
    The inhabitants of all that part of the County of Kanawha included and centered within the limits hereafter prescribed in section two are hereby made a city corporate and body politic by the name of "The City of Charleston," and as such city it shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and by that name it may sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, and may purchase, hold, lease or sell real estate and personal property necessary to the discharge of its corporate duties, or needful or convenient for the good order, government and welfare of said corporation. 
Editor's note- Except for the "perpetual succession" provision and the provisions incorporating and naming the city, the provisions of Charter § 1 are covered by W. Va. Code § 8-12-1. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 2. - Corporate limits. 
    The corporate territorial limits of the City of Charleston shall comprise all that part of the magisterial district of Charleston and all that part of the territory of the magisterial district of Loudon in the County of Kanawha and State of West Virginia, which is bounded and described as follows, to wit: 
[Description deleted.] 
Editor's note- The boundary description has not been published. It has been rendered obsolete by subsequent annexations. 
State Law reference- Annexation, W. Va. Code § 8-6-1 et seq.; decrease of corporate limits, W. Va. Code § 8-7-1 et seq. 
Sec. 3. - Twenty wards established. 
    [Text deleted.] 
Editor's note- The editor's note for Charter § 3 in the city's 1975 Code states as follows: 
This section, as initially enacted by the legislature by Acts 1929, (Munl. ch.), ch. 4, § 3, divided the city into seventeen wards. By Ordinance No. 308, amendatory of this section, enacted Nov. 10, 1958, and ratified at a special election held Dec. 13, 1958, the city was redivided into nineteen wards. Due to subsequent changes in population and the resulting necessity for more proportionate representation in the city council, the council on Sept. 19, 1966, by affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the members, enacted Ord. No. 870, amendatory of this section, by redividing the city into eighteen wards, described by metes and bounds, subject to a referendum as provided in W. Va. Code § 8-4-7; and at a special election on Nov. 8, 1966, held pursuant to prior notice duly published, a majority of the legal votes cast were in favor of the amendment, which thereupon became effective with the declaration by the council of the results of that election, all in conformity with the provisions of W. Va. Code § 8-4-7. The text of this section, as so amended, is omitted as obsolete in some respects due to subsequent addition of territory, but it has been saved from repeal and is on file in the office of the city clerk. Another reason for omission of the text of this section was that Ordinance No. 1570, 7-1-74, directed the mayor to appoint two special committees, one to take a census of the city and the other, upon completion of such census, to prepare and submit to the council a report, with recommendations for the division of the city into wards and the number and boundaries thereof, the number of councilmen to represent each ward, and the number of councilmen at large, together with a proposed ordinance to effect such recommendations. Ordinance No. 3040, adopted on Dec. 20, 1982, redivided the city into twenty wards, described by metes and bounds. For current division of the city into wards and the boundaries thereof, see the official map of the city which, when completed and approved by the city council, will be placed on file in the office of the city clerk. 
State Law reference- Authority to alter ward boundaries or number of wards, W. Va. Code § 8-5-7. 
Sec. 4. - Municipal authorities; elective officers and qualifications for holding office. 
    The municipal authorities of the City of Charleston shall consist of a mayor, city treasurer, municipal judge, and a member of the city council from each ward of the city, and six councilmen at large, who shall be elected by the qualified voters of such city, and such officers shall for the assessment year preceding their respective elections as hereinafter provided, has been assessed with and paid taxes in the City of Charleston upon a valuation of at least one hundred dollars worth of real estate or personal property therein, and any person elected to any one of such offices who has not been assessed with and paid taxes on such amount of property shall not qualify or enter upon the performance of the duties thereof, but such office shall thereby become vacant and shall be filled by a qualified person as provided herein for other vacancies. 
(Ord. No. 870, § 2, 9-19-1966; Ord. No. 1620, § 2; Ord. No. 3040, § 2) 
Editor's note- The property ownership requirements in Charter § 4 violate W. Va. Const. art. III, § 17. See State ex rel. Piccirillo v. City of Follansvee, 160 W. Va. 329, 233 S.E.2d 419 (1977). The note for this section in the city's 1975 Code states that Ord. No. 870 was enacted by affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the members of the city council, and it was ratified by a majority of the legal votes cast at a special election on Nov. 8, 1966. 
Sec. 5. - Officers in addition to elective officers; salaries. 
    In addition to the municipal authorities mentioned in section 4 of this act [this Charter], the city shall have a manager, city clerk, municipal court clerk, city auditor, collector, chief of police, city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, chief of fire department, engineer, health commissioner, building inspector, lockup keeper, humane officer or officers and such member of policemen as council by ordinance may direct. All the officers named in this and the preceding sections shall be paid proper salaries which shall be fixed by the council, except as herein otherwise provided, and such salaries shall be within the limits provided for by this act [this Charter]. 
Editor's note- The reference in Charter § 5 to the health commissioner is obsolete. See Charter § 96 (note). In addition, the last sentence is covered by W. Va. Code § 8-5-12. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 6. - Corporate power vested in council. 
    All the corporate power of said city shall be vested in and exercised by council or under its authority, except as otherwise provided in this act [this Charter]. 
Sec. 7. - Enumeration of numerous miscellaneous powers of council; jurisdiction beyond corporate limits.

    Whenever the mayor or other officer shall fail to make any and all appointments under him, or required to be made by him, for a period of thirty days from the time such appointment should have been made, his office may be declared vacant by the council, and his successor appointed, in the manner herein provided. 
Sec. 31. - Vacancy in office of mayor or treasurer; vacancy in office of appointive officer; officers hold office until successors qualified, unless previously removed.

But the council shall pay any just obligations made by the city and keep and perform all contracts, agreements and obligations made under the law as it was the day before this act goes into effect [this Charter became effective on March 6, 1929], and for which and on which the city is liable or obligated. 
Sec. 33. - Power of council to compel attendance of witnesses and production of records, administer oaths and punish for contempt. 
    The council in the exercise of its powers and the performance of its duties, as prescribed by this act [this Charter], and by the laws of the state, shall have the power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, the production of books and papers, and the power to administer oaths in the same manner and with like effect, and under the same penalties, as notaries public, justices of the peace, and other officers of the state authorized to administer oaths under state laws; and said council shall have the power to punish for contempt as is conferred on county courts by section 13 of chapter 39 of the [state] Code [now W. Va. Code § 7-1-6]. All process necessary to enforce the powers conferred by this act on the council shall be signed by the mayor (or acting mayor), and may be executed by any member of the police force. 
Sec. 34. - Absence or inability of certain officers to perform duties. 
    Whenever for any reason the mayor shall be absent from the city, or unable to attend to the duties of his office temporarily, the president pro tempore of the council shall perform them during such absence or inability, and in the absence or inability of the manager to attend to the duties of his office temporarily, the mayor shall designate someone to perform such duties, provided, that such temporary absence or inability shall not exceed thirty days, but if such absence or inability shall exceed thirty days, then such appointment or designation shall be submitted to the council, for confirmation or rejection. In the absence or inability of any other appointive city official to perform the duties of his office, the person or body making the original appointment, or his successor in office, shall designate someone to fill such office temporarily, or if such absence or inability extends over a period of sixty days, he may appoint someone to fill such office permanently. 
Sec. 35. - Election and term of office of elective officers; appointments by mayor; appointment of city clerk; appointments by manager; duties of mayor and city solicitor; fees. 
    The mayor, members of council, municipal judge and treasurer elected on May 16, 2015, shall serve a term beginning on the third Monday in June, 2015, and ending in January 2019 when the term of their successors begins. Their successors shall be elected on the first Tuesday in November, 2018, in conjunction with the state and county election administered by the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, and shall begin their term on the first Monday of January 2019, unless said Monday is a state holiday, in which case their term shall begin on the first Tuesday of January.

The mayor shall appoint the manager, by and with the advice and consent of the council. The council shall, either at a regular or special meeting called for that purpose, pass upon such nomination and either confirm or reject the same, and if such nomination is rejected, then the mayor shall submit to the council a further nomination of some other person or persons until the nomination is confirmed by council, for said office of manager, but it shall be the duty of the council to pass upon all nominations without unreasonable delay; and in any event within two weeks after the submission of the same, and the failure of members of the council to pass thereon within such time shall be cause for the removal from office of such members of the council as shall have refused to act thereon.

The fifth paragraph of Charter § 35 is covered by W. Va. Code § 8-10-1. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 36. - Appointment, compensation, powers and duties of the manager. 
    The manager shall be appointed in the way and manner hereinbefore provided and shall receive such salary as council may by ordinance prescribe, provided such amount shall not be less than three thousand nor more than five thousand dollars per annum, and he shall have the right to employ one clerk at such salary as council may fix, and such other help as he may require and as council may from time to time allow. 
    The manager shall devote his entire time and attention to the duties of his office, and shall have supervision and control of the executive work and management of the heads of all departments under his control as directed by the mayor. He shall make all contracts for labor and supplies, and generally perform all of the administrative work of the city, and such other duties as council may require of him, and shall possess such other powers and perform such other duties as council shall prescribe. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 36 relative to the salary of the manager are superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-5-12. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 37. - Franchises-Granting; requirements and limitations governing; vote of council required. 
    Franchises or permits granting the right of occupancy of any portion of the streets or alleys for works of public utility or other use, or granting any right or privilege, which the city has the power to grant to individuals, firms or corporations, in order that the latter may serve the public, may be made only upon the following restrictions and conditions: Such franchises, rights and privileges shall be granted only by ordinance duly passed by the council. 
    No grant of any such franchise shall be made without, at the time of making it, providing that the grantee shall indemnify the city against all damages caused by construction, maintenance or operation of such works. Additional provisions and conditions shall be made for the protection of the public against damage or inconvenience by reason of the construction, maintenance or operation thereof. 
    No grant of a franchise for the extension of or an addition to any line or work of public service through, over or under any additional street or territory of the city, shall be made for a period extending beyond the time limit for the expiration of franchise of the principal work of which it is an extension and if the franchise of the principal work is one granted before this act [this Charter] goes into effect and not limited as to time, any franchise granted for an extension or addition thereto shall nevertheless be made subject to the conditions thereof, including a time limit for a period not exceeding twenty-five years. All franchises hereafter granted shall embody therein a plainly expressed condition, where the franchise is for work to be useful chiefly to the citizens of the city, that at the expiration of such franchise or certain periods therein mentioned, the grantee shall, if required by the governing body of the city, sell to the city the plant at its actual value, exclusive of any value for the franchise granted by the city or its earning capacity or productive worth, and no exclusive franchise shall be granted. 
    If the city and the owner of the plant cannot agree upon its worth, then the value shall be ascertained by an impartial arbitration, one arbitrator to be selected by the city, one by such owner of the plant, these two to select a third and the decision of any two to be binding upon both parties, and if they shall fail for a period of thirty days to select such third arbitrator, then either party may apply to the judge of the circuit court of Kanawha County who shall then appoint such third arbitrator. 
    No franchise shall be granted without the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to said council. 
Editor's note- The provisions in Charter § 37 requiring that a franchise can only be granted by ordinance are covered by W. Va. Code § 8-11-3. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. The 25-year time limitation in Charter § 37 is superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-31-1. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. The last sentence in Charter § 37 appears inconsistent with W. Va. Code § 8-11-4. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 38. - Same-Advertisement of application; submission to voters. 
    When any franchise, permit or license granting the right to use the streets, alleys, or public grounds, shall be applied for, the application or petition shall be advertised in two newspapers, published in said city, thirty days before the same shall be heard and determined by the council; and any ordinance granting such rights and franchises shall, on the petition of ten percent of the votes cast for all candidates for the office of mayor at the last preceding election, be submitted to the voters at a special election, for adoption or rejection, which shall be by a majority of the votes cast; said election to be held and conducted as other municipal elections are held; except that all of the expenses of said election shall be borne by the party or corporation desiring said rights and franchise. All such ordinances shall protect the interests of the city, as provided in section 37, as well as such additional conditions, compensations or limitations as council may prescribe. 
Editor's note- The notice requirements in Charter § 38 are inconsistent with W. Va. Code § 8-31-1. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. The referendum provisions in Charter § 38 appear inconsistent with W. Va. Code § 8-11-4. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 39. - Committees of council; adjournment of council meetings; postponement of announcement of vote. 
    Council shall have the right to appoint such committees of its own body as it may deem proper, and may give such committees power and authority to perform any duties and make any reports to council concerning the duties of council, and council may adjourn its meetings from time to time, pending the consideration of any matter, franchise or ordinance, and may postpone the announcement of any vote to an adjourned meeting or to a future meeting.

State Law reference- Ordinance adoption, W. Va. Code § 8-11-4. 
Sec. 41. - Passage of ordinances; revision, reenactment or amendment; effective date; publication of caption or title; resolutions and orders. 
    No ordinance shall be passed, except by bill, and no bill shall be so amended in its passage as to change its original purpose. All bills must be in writing and read in full when presented at a regular or special meeting of council, and except in case of emergency and when so authorized by a vote of four-fifths of the members elected, taken by yeas and nays, no bill shall be considered for final passage at the meeting at which it is introduced; but at any subsequent regular or special meeting bills may be taken up for consideration and final action. No bill except in case of emergency evidenced by a vote of four-fifths of the members of council elected shall be considered for final passage unless the same has been referred to a committee for report. All amendments made by a committee to a bill shall be reported to council and incorporated in said bill, and before final action on said bill, the bill with any amendments shall be fully and distinctly read, after which reading, whether at the meeting at which the bill is reported or a subsequent meeting, the bill may be considered for final action. No bill shall become an ordinance unless on its final passage the vote be taken, the names of the members voting for and against the same be entered of record in the minutes of council, and a majority of all members elected recorded thereon as voting in its favor. Bills referred to a committee may be withdrawn therefrom at any subsequent meeting for present consideration by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of council present. No bill except general appropriation bills, which may embrace the various subjects and accounts for and on account of which moneys are appropriated, and bills fixing the annual salaries of officers and employees of the city, and bills, providing for the paving or improving of streets, or construction of sewers, shall contain more than one object and that shall be expressed in the title, but if any object shall be embraced in an ordinance which is not so expressed the ordinance shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be so expressed. No ordinance shall be revised or reenacted by mere reference to the title thereof, but the same shall be set forth at length as if it were an original ordinance, nor shall any ordinance be amended by providing that, designated words thereof be stricken out and others inserted in lieu thereof, but the ordinance or sections amended shall be set forth in full as amended. All ordinances in force at the time [March 6, 1929] this act [this Charter] goes into effect, not inconsistent herewith, shall remain in full force until altered or repealed as herein provided, and all rights, actions, prescriptions and contracts of the city not inconsistent therewith shall continue to be valid as if this act [this Charter] had not been passed. 
    Any ordinance heretofore passed which may be void on account of failure of council properly to observe any provisions of the Charter of the City of Charleston or ordinances in force at the time said ordinance was passed shall so far as it may affect the validity of any paving or sewer assessments heretofore laid, be in full force and effect until repealed or amended, the same as if legally passed. No ordinance of the council shall take effect until the expiration of five days after its final passage, unless the council shall by a vote of three-fifths of its members elected, taken by yeas and nays, otherwise direct. It shall be the duty of the city clerk to make publication of the caption or title of every ordinance in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Charleston within five days after its passage, but failure so to do shall not affect the validity of any such ordinance. 
    Resolutions and orders of council other than ordinances may be considered for final passage at the meeting at which they are proposed, and shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be in force and effect from and after their passage. 
Editor's note- Except for the last paragraph, the provisions of Charter § 41 are superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-11-4. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 42. - Ordinances to be spread on records of council; "Ordinance Record"; code of ordinances. 
    All ordinances passed, shall be spread in extenso upon the records of the council when adopted. The council shall also provide a well-bound book designated as "Ordinance Record," in which shall be copied by the city clerk all ordinances, in the order in which they are passed, which ordinances, when so copied, shall be compared with the originals by the mayor and shall be signed by him when found correct. Such books shall be indexed so as to show in brief form the substance of the ordinance, and shall be received by all courts and justices in this state as evidence, but the council may adopt by ordinance properly designating and describing it, a code of laws and ordinances, which when adopted shall be printed in book form, or said council may designate any committee, or attorney, or the city solicitor to prepare a code of ordinances for the government of the City of Charleston, and said council may by ordinance adopt the code so prepared as a whole, and when said ordinance adopting said code shall have been passed by the council, the said code shall be and become the law and ordinances of said city, and may be printed by order of the council, and the same shall be so received as evidence of what is printed therein, until errors or omissions be affirmatively shown therein. 
Editor's note- The requirement in Charter § 42 that ordinances be placed in a well-bound book is superseded somewhat by W. Va. Code § 57-1-7a. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. The codification authority in Charter § 42 is superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-11-4(b). See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 43. - Officers conservators of the peace. 
    All persons elected or appointed to the offices named in this act [this Charter] shall be conservators of the peace within said city, and they, and any other officer provided for under this act [this Charter], may be given authority of police officers by the council. 
Sec. 44. - Powers and duties of municipal judge; maximum imprisonment for violation of ordinance; appeal; expense of maintaining persons committed to county jail. 
    The municipal judge shall be ex officio a justice and a conservator of the peace, and with authority to issue processes for all offenses committed within the police jurisdiction of the City of Charleston, of which a justice of the peace has jurisdiction under state statutes, and for all violations of any city ordinances, and shall have charge of and preside over the municipal court of such city; and may commit persons charged with felony or misdemeanor to jail or take bond for their appearance before the grand jury of the circuit, intermediate or other courts of Kanawha County; he shall keep an accurate record of all his judicial proceedings in said court, showing the style of each case, which record shall be indexed and numbered. It shall be his duty to hold daily sessions of his said court, Sunday excepted. Before trying any person charged with any violation of any state law or ordinance a warrant specifying the offense or violation charged shall be issued as herein provided and the municipal judge shall render judgment in any case as the law of the state or the ordinance of the city applying thereto may require; he shall also have the power to issue executions for all fines, penalties and costs imposed by him and he may require immediate payment thereof, and in default of such payment, may commit the party so in default to the jail of the City of Charleston or of the County of Kanawha, or other place of imprisonment in said city, until the fine and penalty and costs shall be paid or satisfied, to be employed during the term of imprisonment as hereafter provided, but for violation of any city ordinance the term of imprisonment in any such case shall not exceed thirty days, and in all cases where a person is sentenced to imprisonment or to the payment of a fine of ten dollars or more, such person shall be allowed an appeal from such decision to the intermediate court of said Kanawha County upon the execution of an appeal bond, with surety deemed approved by the said municipal judge or municipal court clerk in a penalty double the amount of the fine and costs imposed by said judge, conditioned that the person proposing to appeal will appear before the intermediate court of Kanawha County on the first day of the next term thereof to answer for the offense wherewith he is charged and not depart thence without leave of the court and to satisfy all costs and fines imposed against him; and in no case shall judgment for a fine of less than ten dollars be given by the municipal judge if the defendant, his agent or attorney object thereto. When the judgment on appeal is against the appellant for any sum of money, judgment shall be rendered by the intermediate court against the appellant and those who signed the appeal bond as surety thereon. Before said municipal judge or clerk shall accept any natural person as surety upon any bond or recognizance under the provisions of this section, such surety shall furnish a certified statement of the clerk of the county court of any county in this state in which such surety owns real estate, and shall also file an affidavit, the form of which may be prescribed by the municipal judge, showing the bonds and recognizances upon which he is then surety and the amount of each bond or recognizance. If the amount of such bond or recognizance, together with other bonds and recognizances as shown by the affidavit aforesaid, exceeds in amount the assessed value of the surety's property as shown by the certificate of the clerk of the county court, of if any such bond or recognizance theretofore given, by such surety be forfeited and unsatisfied, then such surety shall be disqualified; and if any bond or recognizance be accepted and it subsequently appears that the surety thereon is disqualified then such bond shall be declared void by the municipal judge and the person whose appearance in the intermediate court of Kanawha County and whose payment of fine and costs are thereby secured may be forthwith apprehended and held in the city jail until a proper bond or recognizance is given; provided, however, that whenever any surety is offered less than one hour before the county clerk's office is closed or after it is closed, surety shall make an affidavit that he owns real estate in Kanawha County to an assessed value above encumbrances thereon, of at least double the amount of bond required. Any person making or procuring to be made a false statement in any such affidavit, with intent to deceive said municipal judge, shall be guilty of perjury. If such appeal be taken, the warrant of arrest, the transcript of the judgment, the appeal bond and other papers of the case shall be forthwith delivered by the said judge to the clerk of the intermediate court and the court shall proceed to try the case as upon indictment or presentment and render such judgment, including that of costs, as the law and the evidence may require. 
    On appeals from said municipal court the intermediate court of Kanawha County shall be governed by the same principles with respect to the forfeiture of bonds and recognizances, and the issuance and execution of capiases and writs of fieri facias as prevail in cases in which the state is a party. 
    The expense of maintaining persons committed to the jail of the county by such municipal judge shall be paid by the city. The municipal judge shall account for and pay over the amount of all fines collected by him weekly to the treasurer of the city and shall make monthly reports thereof, and of all other matters, pertaining to his office to the council of said city. 
Editor's note- The first sentence of Charter § 44 is superseded by W. Va. Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. Provisions in the second sentence of Charter § 44 referencing violations of state law are invalid, as the municipal judge only has jurisdiction over ordinance violations. See W. Va. Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. The provisions of Charter § 44 pertaining to an appeal are superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-34-1. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 45. - Qualifications of municipal judge; not to appear as counsel in criminal cases; absence or inability to perform duties; bond. 
    The municipal judge shall be an attorney at law and shall have attained the age of twenty-eight years at the date of the beginning of his term of service and shall have been a resident of this state for the period of five years and of the City of Charleston previous to the beginning of his term of service for the period of five years. He shall not appear as counsel in any criminal case in any court during his term of service. In the absence of, or in case of the inability of the municipal judge to perform his duties, the municipal court clerk shall act as municipal judge in his stead, and in the event that neither the municipal judge nor the municipal court clerk can for any cause perform such duties, then the mayor shall act as municipal judge. The official bond of a justice of the peace shall not be required of the municipal judge. 
Editor's note- The reference in the last sentence of Charter § 45 to a "justice of the peace" should now be to a "magistrate." See W. Va. Code § 50-1-17. 
Sec. 46. - Bail. 
    In all cases of arrest by the police of the city, except in cases of murder and rape, the person arrested shall have the absolute right to give a reasonable and proper bond for his appearance at police court [municipal court] for a trial of his case, and the municipal judge, city clerk, municipal court clerk, mayor, chief of police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police headquarters shall have the power, and it shall be their duty, to accept such bond from such person so arrested, and upon the giving of such bond he shall be released, and it shall be their further duty to permit such person arrested to communicate in any reasonable way with any person or persons with whom he may desire to have communication in reference to his giving bail in order to obtain his release, and each of said officers and all policemen shall render reasonable aid in assisting such person arrested to communicate with any person that he may desire for the purpose of securing such bail. In case one so arrested fail to give bond as aforesaid, the municipal judge, or if said judge be not then sitting, either of the officers named above may order such person committed to the city jail for safekeeping until the trial of his case. 
Editor's note- Charter § 46 is invalid to the extent that it relates to other than ordinance violations. See W. Va. Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2. See also W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 47. - Authority of council, manager and police officers relating to nuisances; duties and responsibilities of owners and occupants of property; enforcement. 
    The manager of said city shall have authority to abate and remove all nuisances in said city. He may compel the owners, agents, assignees, occupants or tenants of any lot, premises, property, building or structure, upon or in which any nuisance may be, to abate and remove the same by orders therefor, and the council shall by ordinance provide a penalty for the violation of such orders. Council may by ordinance regulate the location, construction, repair, use, emptying and cleaning of all water closets, privies, cesspools, sinks, plumbing drains, yards, lots, areaways, pens, stables and other places, where offensive, unsightly, unwholesome, objectionable or dangerous substances or liquids are, or may accumulate, and provide suitable penalties for the violation of such regulations, which may be enforced against the owner, agent, assignee, occupant or tenant of any premises, or structure where such violation may occur. It shall be the duty of all police officers to report to the manager the facts as to the existence of any nuisance known to them. 
    If the owner, agent, tenant, assignee or occupant of any such premises, lot, property, building or structure, as is mentioned herein, shall fail or refuse to abate or remove any such nuisance, as mentioned herein, or to comply with the provisions of any such ordinance and the regulations herein contained, the manager may have said nuisance abated or the provisions of said ordinances carried out, after reasonable notice to said owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee of his intention so to do, and collect the expenses thereof, with one per centum per month interest added from the date of said notice, from the said owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee, by distress or sale, in the same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate for the benefit of said city are herein authorized to be collected, and the expense shall remain a lien upon said lot, or part of lot, the same as taxes levied upon real estate in said city; which lien may be enforced by a suit in equity before any court having jurisdiction, as other liens against real estate are enforced. In case of nonresident owners of real estate such notice may be served upon any tenant, occupant, assignee or rental agent, or by publication thereof once a week for not less than two consecutive weeks in two newspapers of opposite politics, published in said city. 
    And in all cases where any tenant, occupant or agent is required to abate and remove any nuisance under the provisions of this section, or comply with the provisions of any such ordinance as is mentioned herein, the expense thereof may be deducted out of the accruing or accrued rent of said property or amount due said owner from said agent, and such tenant, occupant or agent may recover the amount so paid from the owner, unless otherwise especially agreed upon. 
    Any expense incurred by the manager as herein provided, in the manner aforesaid, may be collected in the manner herein provided, notwithstanding the imposition of any other penalty or penalties upon any of the persons named herein, under any of the provisions of this act [this Charter]. The abatement or removal of any such nuisance by the city at the expense of said city, as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof that the said notice to the owner, occupant, agent or assignee was given as herein prescribed. 
Sec. 48. - Connection with sewer system. 
    The manager may require all owners, tenants or occupants of improved property which may be located upon or near any street or alley along which may be extended any sewer or system of sewerage, which the said city may construct, own or control, to connect with such sewer, or system of sewerage, all privies, ponds, water closets, cesspools, drains or sinks, located upon their respective properties or premises, so that their contents may be made to empty into such sewer or system of sewerage.

    The council shall have the right and authority to establish the width of any sidewalk on any street, alley or public square, or any portion thereof in said city, to cause to be put down a suitable curb of brick, stone or other material alone for the footways and sidewalks of the streets, alleys or public squares or portion thereof, and to order the construction, relaying and repair of sidewalks and gutters of such material and width, and in such manner, as the council may reasonably prescribe by the owners or occupiers of the lots or parts of lots facing upon said streets, alleys and public squares; and in case of a failure or refusal of any such owners or occupiers of the lots or parts of lots to construct, relay or repair such sidewalks and gutters, when required, it shall be lawful for the council to have such sidewalks and gutters constructed, relaid or repaired, and levy and collect the expense thereof, with one per centum per month interest added after a demand of thirty days has been made by the treasurer of the city from the said owner, owners, occupier, occupiers or any of them; and in all cases of such assessment, whether for the construction, relaying or repairing of sidewalks or gutters, payment thereof shall be made to the treasurer within thirty days after the completion of the work and demand made, and if not so paid the city is hereby authorized to collect or cause to be collected the expense thereof, with one per centum per month interest added after work has been completed and a demand of thirty days, and they shall have the power to collect, or cause to be collected, the same from said owner, owners, occupier or occupiers or any of them, by distress and sale, in same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate for the benefit of the said city are herein authorized to be collected, and in addition there shall be a lien upon the real estate against which such assessment has been levied for the construction, relaying and repairing of sidewalks and gutters as herein provided, which lien may be enforced by a suit in equity before any court having jurisdiction, as other liens against real estate are enforced, and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to cause to be certified to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County the order laying an assessment authorized by this section. The clerk of the county court of Kanawha County is hereby required to record and index such assessments in the proper trust deed book in the name of persons against whose property assessments appear therein; provided, however, that a reasonable notice shall first be given to said owner or occupier or their agent, that they are required to construct, relay or repair such sidewalks or gutters. In case of nonresidents who have no known agent in said city, such notice may be given by publication for a period not less than once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper printed in said city; and in all cases where a tenant shall be required to construct, relay or repair sidewalks or gutters in front of the property of his or her occupancy, the expense of such construction or relaying or repairing may be deducted out of the accruing rent of said property, and he may recover the amounts paid from the owner; unless otherwise especially agreed upon. The laying or construction of any such sidewalks by said city shall be prima facie proof that the said notice to the owner (resident or nonresident) or occupier, or their agent, was given as herein required.

    The council shall have authority to levy and collect an annual tax on real estate and personal property in said city and to impose a license and assess a tax on all dogs kept within the city and to impose a tax upon all other subjects of taxation under the several laws of the state, which shall be uniform with respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of said city, and shall only be levied on such property, real, personal and mixed, on which the state imposes a tax; provided, that with the exception of the special levies authorized by law, no greater levy shall be laid by said council on the taxable property of said city than fifty cents upon each hundred dollars of the assessed valuation of the property of the municipality; and, provided, further, that the council shall, in making such levy, be subject to all provisions of chapter 9 of the Acts of the Legislature of 1908 [now codified as art. 8, ch. 11 of the Code of West Virginia] and any and all amendments thereto, except as herein provided. There shall be a tax of two dollars annually assessed on each and every male inhabitant of said city over the age of twenty-one years who is subject to a capitation tax under the laws of the State of West Virginia. The same shall be set out and included in the personal property book against every such inhabitant, and shall be collected under the authority of the city at the time of collecting other levies and taxes. 
Editor's note- To the extent that Charter § 51 relates to taxation of real and personal property, it is preempted to general law by W. Va. Code § 8-13-1. See W. Va. Code §§ 8-1-6, 11-6-6d. Authority to tax dogs is also found in W. Va. Code § 8-13-10. As there apparently no longer is a state capitation tax, the provisions in this section relative to same are obsolete. 
Sec. 52. - Collection of taxes. 
    The city taxes annually levied by the council shall be collected as follows: Immediately after the annual levy for city taxes is laid the council shall direct the proper officer of the city to extend the same on the property books made out by him, including therein the proper capitation tax; he shall make out therefrom proper tax tickets in the following manner: That is to say, instead of a single ticket for the whole amount charged to any person, firm or corporation there shall be two tickets, each for one-half of said amount; these half tickets shall be severally numbered or designated "first" and "second" and the same, after being examined and compared by the council and found to be correct, shall be turned over to the treasurer of the city on the first day of October following the levy and the treasurer's receipt for the gross amount thereof shall be returned, entered upon its record and the treasurer charged therewith. The treasurer shall give notice by publication for twenty days in two newspapers of opposite politics published in said city, that said tickets are in his hands for collection stating the penalty for nonpayment thereof and the time and place when the same may be paid; provided, however, that the taxpayers shall have the right to anticipate the payment of the whole or any part of the taxes assessed against them. 
    The one-half ticket designated "first" may be paid to the treasurer of the city any time before the first day of November next succeeding said levy; the one-half ticket designated "second" may be paid to the treasurer of the city at any time before the first day of May next succeeding said levy. To all the half tickets designated "first" remaining unpaid in the treasurer's hands on the said first day of November succeeding said levy, a penalty of ten percent shall be added and collected from the taxpayers. To all half tickets designated "second" remaining unpaid in the treasurer's hands on the first day of May succeeding said levy a penalty of ten percent shall be added as a penalty and shall be collectible from the taxpayers. On said first day of November succeeding said levy all such half tickets designated "first" and on said first day of May succeeding such levy all such half tickets designated "second" remaining unpaid in the treasurer's hands shall be taken up by the council and settlement had with said treasurer on said days respectively, or on the next succeeding days, respectively, if said days shall fall upon Sunday, and thereupon the council shall place said tickets in the hands of the city collector for collection and shall take his receipt therefor; provided, however, that the council shall have the power any year, by resolution, to extend the time within which the tickets may remain in the treasurer's hands and be paid to him without adding the penalty, for a period named therein not exceeding, however, a total of fifteen days. 
    The city collector shall have the power to collect said tickets so placed in his hands, together with the penalties thereon herein provided to be added thereto, and the compensation of such city collector for making such collection of the taxes aforesaid shall be fixed by the council. 
    The city collector shall be charged with the gross amount of said tax tickets so delivered to him for collection, including the penalties accrued thereon so delivered, and no deduction therefrom shall be allowed, unless on or before the first day of August of each year he makes out and returns to the council a delinquent list of taxes uncollected for such year, with his oath attached hereto, stating that such list is correct and just and that he has received no part of the taxes mentioned therein, and that he has used due diligence to find property liable to distress for taxes, has found none, and that he could not collect the same. 
    Neither the treasurer nor the city collector shall take or collect anything but money for payment of taxes. 
Editor's note- Charter § 52 is preempted to general law by W. Va. Code § 8-13-1. See W. Va. Code § 11A-1-1 et seq. 
Sec. 53. - Powers of collector. 
    The city collector shall have the power to collect the city taxes placed in his hands except as otherwise provided in this act [this Charter], and he shall also have power to collect the city claims which may be placed in his hands by the council for collection, except that fines imposed by the municipal judge shall not be collected by him. 
Sec. 54. - Distress for collection of taxes. 
    All goods and chattels belonging to a person, firm, corporation or estate, assessed with any city taxes, whether the same be a capitation tax or a tax upon real estate or personal property or an assessment for paving or other improvements, shall be liable for said tax, and may be distrained therefor in whosoever's possession they may be found, and the city collector shall have the same power to collect said tax or assessment from any person owing a debt to or having in his possession any estate belonging to a person assessed with any tax or assessment of any kind that the sheriff has to collect state taxes in such cases. The city collector may distrain and sell for all city taxes and assessments and in all respects have the same power to enforce the collection thereof as the sheriff has to enforce the collection of state taxes. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 54 are obsolete insofar as they relate to the capitation tax. As to other taxes, Charter § 54 appears preempted to general law by W. Va. Code § 8-13-1. See W. Va. Code § 11A-1-1 et seq. 
Sec. 55. - Lien on real estate for taxes-Established; enforcement by suit in court of record; priority of lien. 
    There shall be a lien upon all real estate within said city for the city taxes assessed thereon, including such penalties added thereto for nonpayment thereof as are prescribed by this act [this Charter], from the first day of January of the year in which said taxes are assessed. Said liens may be enforced by appropriate suit in any court of record in Kanawha County; provided, such suit be instituted within five years from the time the said liens attached as herein provided, and such suit may either be instituted by and in the name of the City of Charleston as plaintiff, or said city may intervene by petition in any suit pending to sell or enforce liens against any real estate which is subject to such lien for said taxes. The liens herein created shall have priority over all other liens except those for taxes due the state. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 55 are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code § 8-13-1. See also W. Va. Code § 11A-1-1 et seq. 
Sec. 56. - Same-Enforcement by tax sale. 
    Said liens for city taxes and attendant penalties may also be enforced by certifying the same to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County for certification to the state auditor, and the same may be certified down by said auditor, and sold for taxes, interest, penalties and commissions thereon, in the same manner, at the same time, and by the same officer as real estate is sold for taxes, interest, damages, cost and commission due the state thereon, which officer shall account therefor on settlement with the city and pay over the same to the treasurer of the city. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 56 are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code § 8-13-1. See W. Va. Code § 11A-1-1 et seq. 
Sec. 57. - Limitation on authority of county to tax persons and property within city for streets, education or poor outside city limits; control of streets and schools within city; joint ownership of bridges. 
    No taxes or levies shall be assessed upon or collected from the taxable persons or property within the corporate limits of said city, for the construction, improvement or keeping in repair of roads, or the building, leasing or repairing of schoolhouses, or the purchase of lands for the same, or for the support of schools, or for the support of the poor of Kanawha County, outside of said corporate limits, for any year in which it shall appear that said city shall at its own expense provide for its own poor and keep its own roads, streets, sewers and bridges in good order. And neither the county court of Kanawha County nor the authorities of the district in which said city is situated, shall have or exercise jurisdiction within the corporate limits with relation to the roads, streets, alleys, bridges, wharves, docks, ferries, schools or schoolhouses, but the same shall be and remain under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the municipal authorities of said city, except that the board of education in the independent school district of the City of Charleston shall have jurisdiction, supervision and control of the schools and schoolhouses in said district; and said city shall be liable only for the construction, improvement, repair and good order of the roads, streets, sewers, alleys, wharves and bridges in its corporate limits, except that the County of Kanawha may become a joint owner and controller with the City of Charleston in a bridge or bridges across Kanawha River. 
Editor's note- Insofar as Charter § 57 relates to roads, it is superseded by W. Va. Code § 17-10-1 et seq. 
Sec. 58. - Depositories. 
    It shall be the duty of the treasurer of the city to keep all funds of the city in some bank or banks within said city, which shall pay interest on such deposits and which shall pay interest on the average daily balance of such funds in all accounts of the percent [percentage] equal to that paid by state depositors on all funds of the State of West Virginia and in the same manner and at the same time. If no bank within the city is willing at any time to receive deposits of the treasurer and to pay such interest thereon, the treasurer shall report this fact to the council, who shall thereupon designate a bank or banks in which he shall deposit said funds for the time being and until some bank in said city will receive such deposits on such terms. Before receiving any such deposits such bank or banks shall give bond in such penalty as the council shall prescribe, and with securities to be approved by said council, conditioned for the prompt payment, whenever lawfully required, of all the city moneys or parts thereof which may be deposited with them, which bond shall be renewed at such times as the council may require.

Sec. 59-a. - Same-For improvement of streets. 
    The City of Charleston is hereby authorized to issue and sell bonds of said city, for the purpose of paying the city's part of the cost of grading, curbing, paving, sewering or otherwise improving the avenues, streets, roads and alleys of said city, and for the purpose of providing funds to cover all or any part of the cost of grading, curbing, paving or sewering that may be assessed against abutting property owners in the manner provided for by law; and said city is hereby given full power to employ the proceeds of such bonds in the purchase of paving certificates or other permanent improvement certificates issued under the provisions of the Charter and made liens or assessments against real estate in said city, at not to exceed their par value, and may hold and collect or otherwise dispose of the same; provided, that said city shall not by the sale or issuance of bonds for the purposes above mentioned, cause the aggregate of its indebtedness, of every kind whatever, to exceed five per centum of the value of the taxable property therein. 
    The proceeds of any bond issue, authorized under this section, shall be set aside as a separate fund, and all special assessments covering improvements, the cost whereof has been advanced out of this fund, shall be paid into and become a part of said special fund and be used for the same purpose and in the same manner as the proceeds of said original fund. 
    This fund shall continue to be used for the purposes mentioned herein, until such time as the city's part of the cost of grading, curbing, paving, sewering or otherwise improving the avenues, streets, roads or alleys of the city equals the original proceeds of the bond issues authorized for the purposes mentioned herein. The issuance and sale of bonds, authorized by this section, shall be governed by all of the restrictions of the constitution of this state and statutes of this state with respect to the issuance and sale of other bonds of said city. No issuance and sale of bonds, under this section, shall be made, unless at the same time provision is made for the collection of a direct annual tax, sufficient to pay the annual interest on the same and create a sinking fund to pay the principal within the time for which said bonds shall be issued. The direct annual tax, provided for in this section, shall be set aside as a separate fund, to be known as an interest and sinking fund. All interest collected on special assessments authorized or referred to in this section shall be placed in and become a part of said special interest and sinking fund, until the principal and interest of said bonds are paid.

Sec. 61. - Contracts for improvement of streets; assessment of cost. 
    Whenever the council of said city shall deem it expedient to cause any street or alley in said city or portion thereof to be paved, curbed or macadamized, or otherwise improved in a permanent manner, it shall order the work done in the following manner and upon the following terms: The contract for such paving or other improvements shall, after due advertisement in which the council shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids, be let to the lowest reasonable bidder. The contractor shall look only to the city for the payment of the work, and in no sense to the abutting landowners, except as hereinafter provided. The total cost of grading and paving or otherwise improving any such street or alley (with the exception that where a street is occupied by the street car tracks or other railways, such cost of opening or otherwise improving the distance between the rails and two additional feet outside of each rail, shall be borne and paid entirely by the streetcar or other railway company operating such street or other railway unless otherwise provided by the franchise of such streetcar or other railway company granted previous to the passage of this act [this Charter]), shall be borne by the owners of the land abutting upon said street, alley or portion thereof, according to the following plan, that is to say: Payment is to be made by all landowners on either side of such portion of a street or block so paved or improved in such portion of the total cost, less the portion, if any, chargeable to such street or other railway company, as the frontage in feet of his land so abutting bears to the total frontage of all lands so abutting on such street, alley or portion thereof so paved or improved as aforesaid. 
    When the paving of any street, or alley, or portion thereof shall have been let to contract and the work done as hereinbefore provided, it shall be the duty of the engineer of said city to cause the several frontages abutting thereon to be measured, and to calculate the assessment upon each and every landowner so abutting and to certify the same to the council, showing the proper amount to be determined, as provided in the foregoing plan. It shall be the duty of the council to examine and compare such assessment, amounts and names so certified to it, and thereupon give notice by publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in said city, that an assessment under this act [this Charter] is about to be laid against the abutting property for paving or improvements done on said streets, or alleys, describing the location of such paving or improvements, and any owner or owners thereof shall have the right to appear before said council, within two weeks from the first publication thereof, and move to correct an apportionment or assessment excessive or improperly made as charged, which correction said council shall have the power to make according to the intent of this act [this Charter], and if found to be correct or when corrected by the council aforesaid, it shall enter the same, together with a description of the lots of land as to location, frontage, depth and ownership, so far as the same may be ascertained, upon its records and to enter in its records that such owners and lots be assessed and chargeable with the amount so ascertained to be borne by them respectively; and when so approved, certified and entered on record, the same shall be and constitute an assessment against said owners and lots for such respective amounts. And it shall be the duty of the council to immediately certify such assessment to the treasurer for collection as herein provided, and a copy of said order shall be certified by the city clerk to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County, who shall record and index the same in the proper trust deed book in the name of each person against whose property assessments appear therein. The amount so assessed against said abutting landowners shall be paid in ten payments, as follows: That is to say, one-tenth of said amount, together with interest on the whole assessment, shall be paid into the city treasury, before the first day of May next after said work is completed and said assessments have been certified to the county clerk. And a like one-tenth, together with interest for one year upon the whole amount remaining unpaid on or before the first day of May in each succeeding year thereafter until all has been paid, and each of said installments of one-tenth beginning with the first, shall bear interest on the amount of said installments as six per centum per annum from the date of record of same in the county clerk's office until paid; provided, however, that any abutting owner so liable for any portion of the cost of such paving shall have the right at any time after the same is certified as aforesaid to the treasurer for collection to anticipate the payment of any or all of said assessments and shall be allowed to pay the face of said assessments with interest at six percent per annum only from the time of recordation to the time of payment. To each of such installments of assessments remaining unpaid in the treasurer's hands on the day herein specified for the payment thereof, a penalty of ten per centum on the principal sum shall be added and any assessment so remaining unpaid in the treasurer's hands on such date, shall be taken up on such settlements had with the treasurer on such dates, and thereupon place such assessments with the penalty added thereto, in the hands of the city collector to be treated and considered, and payment thereof enforced in all respects as hereinbefore provided for the collection of taxes due the city, and they shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor the same as for taxes, which lien may be enforced in the same manner as provided for taxes. The lien hereinbefore provided for shall have priority over all other liens except those for taxes due the state and shall be on a parity with taxes and assessments due the city, and shall be effective as of the date that the assessment is laid by the council. Whenever all such assessments, for paving, sewerage, macadamizing or other improvements shall be paid in full to the treasurer, he shall deliver to the party paying the same a release of the lien therefor which may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County as other releases of liens, and whenever any such assessments shall not be in the hands of the treasurer for collection, but the same shall be shown to the satisfaction of the city auditor or other official performing the duties of auditor, to have been paid in full or any officer entitled to receive the same, such auditor or the mayor may in like manner execute such release.

In case of a corner lot, frontage is to be measured along the longest dimension thereof abutting on such street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which such sewer is laid. Any lot having a depth of two hundred feet or more and fronting on two streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, one in the front and one in the rear of said lot shall be assessed on both of said streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, if a sewer is constructed in both such streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements. Where a corner lot has been assessed on the end it shall not be assessed on the side, and where it has been assessed on the side, it shall not be assessed on the end. Thereupon said council shall give like notice by publication as is required in case of street paving assessments, and the same rights shall exist as to the persons and property affected and the same duty as to corrections by said council as are prescribed with reference to paving, which report shall in like manner be examined by the council, and if found to be correct, or corrected as aforesaid, and such estimated assessments to be a fair and equitable apportionment of the cost of such sewer upon the basis hereinbefore described, it shall enter an order upon its records, setting forth such location, depth, ownership and said amount of such sewer assessments, against each, respectively, calculated as aforesaid, and the entry of such order shall constitute and be an assessment for such proportion and amount so fixed therein against such respective owners and lots, and if after such advertisements, notice and hearing, said council shall find that such apportionment at such rate is unjust or inequitable, and contrary to the intent of this act [this Charter], it shall ascertain, fix and assess the cost thereof among and upon the abutting owners respectively, justly and equitably and according to the intent hereof, and in like manner, assess and enter the amount so fixed respectively upon its records, and the council shall, in either event, thereupon certify the same to the treasurer for collection, and certify a copy of such order to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County, who shall record the same in the proper trust deed book, and index the same in the name of each owner of any such lot so charged with such assessment, and such assessment so made shall constitute and be a lien upon said lots respectively, which shall have priority over all other liens, except those for taxes due the state, and shall be on a parity with other taxes and assessments due the city. Said amounts so assessed against the said several landowners shall be paid by the parties liable therefor to the said treasurer at all times, in the manner and with the attendant penalties for failure to pay promptly at the time prescribed in all respects as hereinbefore provided in the case of assessments for paving streets and alleys in a permanent manner, and the parties liable therefor shall, in the same manner, and to the same extent, have the right and be entitled to anticipate any or all of such installments thereon as in such case provided.

Notice to so connect may be given to the owner, lessee, or occupant of such building. Each day's failure to comply with such notice and connect with such sewer by such owner or owners, ten days after such notice is given, shall be a misdemeanor and a separate and new offense under this section, and every such offense shall be punishable by fine of not less than five nor more than twenty-five dollars. The expense incurred by any tenant, occupant, or agent in complying with the order of said council to make such sewer connection may be deducted out of the accruing rents as provided for in section forty-seven relating to the abatement of nuisances. Jurisdiction to hear, try, determine and sentence for violation of this section is vested in the municipal court of such city. 
    In the paving, curbing, macadamizing or otherwise improving streets and alleys and providing for the assessment of the cost thereof under section 61 or section 88 of the Charter of the City of Charleston there may be included in any such assessment the cost of constructing the necessary drains for the disposal of surface water.

Sec. 62-a. - Construction of sewer systems or common, lateral, branch, trunk or combined sewers. 
    The council is authorized and empowered to order and cause to be constructed, in said city, or part within and part outside of the limits of said city, public, common, lateral, branch, trunk and combined sewers or public sewer systems, or both, by contract or directly by the city, for the benefit of said city or any part thereof, and to purchase lands or easements therein or to condemn lands or easements therein in the manner provided by law, for such sewers or sewer systems, and when the council shall order and complete the construction of any such sewer or sewer system or any part thereof in said city, the owners of the property abutting on such sewer or abutting upon an avenue, street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which such sewer shall be constructed, or abutting on any avenue, street, alley, right-of-way, easement in which any common sewer, part of a sewer system, is constructed and laid, may be charged with all or any part of the cost thereof, including the cost of such sewer or sewer system at and across intersections at avenues, streets, roads and alleys adjacent thereto. If said work is let to contract, the provisions of the Charter of the City of Charleston relating to street paving contracts shall apply. 
    A sewer system shall be deemed to include all the common sewers, whether they be lateral, branch, trunk or combined sewers, which serve to drain a definite drainage area as specified in the order of the council directing the work to be done. 
    A common sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer in which all abutters have equal rights of entrance and use. 
    A lateral sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer which does not receive the sewage from any other common sewer. 
    A branch sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer into which the sewage from two or more lateral sewers is discharged, including storm and surface water sewers. 
    A trunk sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer into which the sewage from two or more branch sewers is discharged. 
    A combined sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer intended to receive domestic sewage and industrial wastes. 
    When said sewer or sewer system is completed the engineer of said city shall report to the council in writing the total cost of such sewer or sewer system, and a description of the lots and lands as to the location, frontage, depth and ownership liable for such sewer assessment, so far as the same may be ascertained, together with the amount chargeable against each lot and owner, calculated in the following manner: The total cost of constructing and laying the sewer or sewer system, including the portions thereof laid in the intersections of streets and alleys, shall be borne by the owners of the land abutting upon the streets, avenues, alleys, rights-of-way or easements or portions thereof in which the sewer or some part of the sewer system, is constructed and laid; payment is to be made by each landowner on either side of such portion of a street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which a common sewer is laid, in the proportion that the frontage of his land upon such portion of said street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which such sewer or sewer system is laid bears to the total frontage of all lands so abutting on such street, alley, right-of-way or easement; in which the sewer or some part of the sewer system is laid; provided, that the charge laid against any owner of property shall not exceed three dollars per linear foot of frontage on each side of such street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which any such sewer or part of a sewer system is laid. In case of a corner lot, frontage is to be measured along the longest dimension thereof abutting on such street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which such sewer is laid, but if sewered on both sides then such a corner lot is to be charged only with the side first sewered. Any lot having a depth of two hundred feet or more and fronting on two streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, one in the front and one in the rear of said lot shall be assessed on both of said streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or easements, if a sewer is constructed on both such streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or easements. When a corner lot has been assessed on either or both ends, it shall not be assessed on the side, and where it has been assessed on the side, it shall not be assessed on the end. 
    In the case of corner lots where the cost of sewering along one dimension is not assessed against the owner thereof, and in case of lots less than two hundred feet deep abutting at both ends on a street, alley, right-of-way or easement in which a sewer is laid, the cost of sewering along the dimension or end not assessed against the property owner shall in every case be borne by the City of Charleston. 
    Thereupon said council shall give like notice by publication as is required in case of street paving assessments, and the same rights shall exist as to the persons and property affected and the same duty as to corrections by said council as are prescribed with reference to paving. The report of the city engineer shall in like manner be examined by the council, and if found to be correct or corrected as aforesaid, and such estimated assessments to be a fair and equitable apportionment of the cost of such sewer or sewer system upon the basis hereinbefore described, it shall enter an order upon its records, setting forth such location, depth, ownership and said amount of such sewer assessments, against each respectively, calculated as aforesaid, and the entry of such order shall constitute and be an assessment for such proportion and amount so fixed therein against such respective owners and lots; and, if after such advertisement, notice and hearing, said council shall find that such apportionment at such rate is unjust or inequitable, and contrary to the intent of this act [this Charter], it shall ascertain, fix and assess the cost thereof among and upon the abutting owners respectively, justly and equitably and according to the intent hereof, and in like manner assess and enter the amount so fixed respectively upon its records; and, the council shall, in either event, thereupon certify the same to the treasurer for collection and certify a copy of such order to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County, who shall record the same in the proper trust deed book, and index the same in the name of each owner of any such lot so charged with such assessment, and such assessment so made shall constitute and be a lien upon said lots respectively, which shall have priority over all other liens, except those for taxes due the state, and shall be on a parity with other taxes and assessments due the city. Said amounts so assessed against the said several landowners shall be paid by the parties liable therefor to the said treasurer at all times, in the manner and with the attendant penalties for failure to pay promptly at the time prescribed in all respects as hereinbefore provided in the case of assessments for paving streets and alleys in a permanent manner, and the parties liable therefor shall, in the same manner, and to the same extent, have the right and be entitled to anticipate any or all of such installments thereon as in such case provided. The owners of, or the tenants, occupants or agents in control of any lot abutting on or near or adjacent to any street, avenue, alley, right-of-way or easement in said city, in which a public sewer is or may hereafter be laid and constructed, upon which lot any business or resident building is or may hereafter be erected, or upon which any water stands not connected with any public sewer, may be required and compelled to connect any such building or lot with such sewer. Notice to so connect may be given to the owner, lessee, or occupant of such building. Each day's failure to comply with such notice and connect with such sewer by such owner or owners, ten days after such notice is given, shall be a misdemeanor and a separate and new offense under this section, and every such offense shall be punishable by fine of not less than five nor more than twenty-five dollars. The expense incurred by any tenant, occupant, or agent in complying with the order of said council to make such sewer connection may be deducted out of the accruing rents as provided for in section 47 relating to the abatement of nuisances.

    All valid ordinances and regulations passed and adopted by the council, or by the board of affairs and council on or before the first day of May, 1915, and not inconsistent with this act [this Charter], shall be and remain in force unless and until repealed, and the council now [March 6, 1929] in office shall continue to exercise its powers as such until the officers elected in 1931 shall have been qualified. 
Editor's note- The editor's note in the city's 1975 Code for Charter § 84 states as follows: 
The "board of affairs" herein referred to was the governing body of the city under a Charter enacted in 1907, which was superseded by a new Charter enacted in 1915 providing for a mayor-council form of government. 
Sec. 85. - Powers and duties of policemen. 
    The mayor shall appoint such number of policemen as are or may be hereafter prescribed by the city council by ordinance, and the mayor shall have at his discretion, the absolute right and power to dismiss any policeman and appoint another in his stead. The policemen shall be under command of the mayor and the chief of police, to be appointed as in this act [this Charter] provided for, and shall perform any and all duties incident to the office of policeman under the instructions and command of the mayor and the chief of police, and, in addition to the usual and customary duties prescribed by the laws of this state and under the provisions of this Charter required of them, it shall specially be the duty of each police officer to report to the chief of police, or some one designated by said chief of police to receive such report, daily and oftener if occasion demands, the condition of all streets, sidewalks, alleys, basements, backyards, buildings, unimproved lots and all other things and matters within the limits of said city that may come under the notice of such policemen which may relate to the health of the citizens thereof, the sanitary conditions, the necessity of the removal of any obstructions upon any of the streets, alleys or sidewalks, and it shall be the duty of the policemen under their instructions to perform all the duties and exercise all the powers ordinarily imposed upon or given to the officers now known as health officers. It shall also be the duty of each police officer to perform all the duties of humane officer and to exercise all the functions, power and authority relating thereto which are or may be prescribed by any law of this state or ordinance of the city. A police officer in making arrests shall have all of the power and authority of a constable under the laws of the State of West Virginia. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 85, insofar as they relate to the appointment, promotion, dismissal, etc., of police, are superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-14-6 et seq. In the last sentence the term "constable" should now be "deputy sheriff." See W. Va. Code § 50-1-17. 
Sec. 86. - Compensation of members of council; absence from meetings. 
    Each member of the city council shall be paid during his term of office the sum of two dollars and fifty cents for each meeting of the council that he shall attend; provided, that the aggregate amount to be paid to each member of the council shall not exceed the sum of one hundred dollars per annum. The roll of the members of the council shall be called at the beginning and at the end of each meeting thereof, and those members only who answer in person at each roll call shall be entitled to receive their pay for such meeting. The names of those members present at each roll call shall be entered upon the record. If there should not be a quorum present at the first roll call and the meeting be adjourned for that reason, then it shall not be a meeting that will entitle those present to the payment of the sum of two dollars and fifty cents as provided in this section. It shall be the duty of all councilmen to attend all of its meetings, and if any councilman shall be absent from the meetings of council as shown by its records for three consecutive meetings, then his office shall ipso facto become vacant, unless the council shall authorize or excuse such absence. If the office of any councilman shall become vacant under the provisions of this section, then the council shall proceed to fill the same as it is authorized to do in the case of vacancies. 
Editor's note- The compensation provided for in Charter § 86 probably is obsolete. See W. Va. Code § 8-5-12. 
Sec. 87. - Reports by manager to council; reports by officers and employees under supervision of manager. 
    It shall be the duty of the manager, not later than the tenth day of any month after his appointment, to make a detailed report to the council for the preceding month. Such report shall show under distinct heads, first, the names and salaries of all employees under the control and supervision of manager; second, all expenditures or disbursements in the several departments under the supervision of the manager; third, an itemized statement of all purchases, together with the cost thereof, for each and every such department; fourth, all such other matters and things as the council may by proper ordinance or resolution require of said manager. Such report shall be entered of record in the minutes of the council and be a public record, open to the inspection of all persons. All officers or employees in any of the departments under the supervision of the manager shall, whenever required by said manager, make full and complete reports of all things done by them as such officers or employees in connection with the business of the city. 
Sec. 88. - Additional method for paving streets; assessment certificates. 
    In addition to the method provided for paving streets, by section 61 of the Charter of the City of Charleston, the council may order any street, avenue, public alley, or portion thereof, to be graded and paved, repaved, or otherwise permanently improved, and the council may order the mayor and city clerk to issue a certificate for each installment of the amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such street, avenue, or alley. The amount specified in said assessment certificate shall be a lien as aforesaid [in § 61] in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or part of a lot fronting on such street, avenue, or alley, and such certificate shall draw interest from the date of said assessment and the payment may be enforced in the name of the holder of said certificate by proper suit in equity in any court having proper jurisdiction to enforce such lien; the council shall fix the amount of such assessment, advertise for bids and do all other things in connection therewith as is provided for paving or permanently improving any street or alley or any portion thereof in section 61, except that such assessment laid under this section shall include the whole cost of such improvement, including the cost of grading and paving squares at intersections of streets and curbing, the costs of which intersections shall be apportioned against the several properties fronting upon the street or portion thereof so improved; and such certificates shall be issued in the same number of installments and payable at the same time as other paving or permanent improvements are provided to be paid for, and shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular lot against which they are assessed in the same way and manner that assessments are liens under section 61 of said Charter. And nothing contained in this act, or in the Charter of the City of Charleston, shall be construed as imposing a time limit upon the enforcement by appropriate suit of any lien for public improvements, heretofore or hereafter created. 
    Certificates authorized by this section may be issued, sold or negotiated to the contractor doing the work, or to any other person if the council deem it expedient; provided, the city in issuing such certificates shall not be held as guarantor or in any way liable for payment thereof. 
    Certificates so issued shall contain a provision to the effect that in the event of default in the payment of any one of said certificates, when due, and said default continuing for a period of sixty days, then all unpaid certificates shall become due and payable and the holder of said certificates may proceed to collect all of such unpaid certificates in the manner hereinbefore provided. Certificates issued in pursuance of this section shall be negotiable at any bank in the City of Charleston. 
    The owner of the land or lot of land assessed under this section may at any time anticipate and pay such assessment or certificate with accrued interest thereon. 
    Provided, that no street, avenue or alley shall be paved or otherwise permanently improved pursuant to this section except and unless two-thirds of all the members elected to the council shall concur in the passage of the ordinance providing therefor, and the vote thereon shall be taken by ayes and noes, and duly entered upon the record. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 88 are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code §§ 8-13-1, 8-16-1 et seq., 8-17-1 et seq. and 8-18-1 et seq. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 88-a. - Void, irregular or omitted assessments. 
    In the case of the construction of any pavement, sewer, sidewalk or other permanent improvement under the provisions of this Charter where an assessment has heretofore been laid, or may hereafter be laid for the cost thereof, which said assessment is or shall be void or voidable by reason of errors, irregularities or defects in the proceedings under which such improvement was made, or in case such assessment shall have been made against the wrong person or shall have been omitted to be made in a case where the same was proper, it shall be the duty of the council within two years after the completion of such permanent improvement, or after any court shall have declared such assessment invalid, to cause notice to be given to any person against whom the cost of said improvement might properly be or have been assessed under said Charter, of its intention to lay such assessment against him and fixing a time and place at which he may appear and show cause against the same. Said notice shall be served as provided in the said Charter for the giving of notices in assessment proceedings, or in any other manner provided by law, including by publication where the person is a nonresident of the city or cannot be found. At the time and place fixed for hearing under the notice aforesaid, or at any time thereafter, the council shall proceed to lay and levy an assessment for the cost of such permanent improvement in such manner as would have been lawful under proper proceedings at the time said improvement was made, unless the person so notified shall show good cause against the same, and no further notice of such assessment shall be necessary. The assessment so laid shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor and may be recorded and enforced in the same manner as provided for other liens for permanent improvements. This section shall apply to assessments made and certificates issued under section 88 of this Charter, as well as to other assessments and liens for public improvements. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 88-a are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code §§ 8-13-1, 8-16-1 et seq., 8-17-1 et seq. and 8-18-1 et seq. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 88-b. - Assessment certificates to pay for cost of construction of sewers and sewer systems. 
    In addition to the method for the payment of the cost of construction of sewers and sewer systems provided by sections 62 and 62-a of the Charter of the City of Charleston, the council may order any sewer or sewer system constructed and laid, in any block, street, avenue, alley or in any right-of-way or easement, or portion thereof, and the council may order the mayor and city clerk to issue a certificate for each installment of the amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such street, avenue, alley, right-of-way or easement in which such sewer system is constructed and laid, and the amount specified in said assessment certificate shall be a lien as aforesaid in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or part of lot fronting on such street, avenue or alley, right-of-way or easement, and such certificate shall draw interest from the date of said assessment and the payment may be enforced in the name of the holder of said certificate by proper suit in equity in any court having proper jurisdiction to enforce such lien; the council shall fix the amount of such assessment, advertise for bids and do all other things in connection therewith as is provided in section 61 of said Charter for paving or permanently improving any street or alley or any portion thereof, the costs of which shall be apportioned against the several properties fronting upon the street, avenue, alley, right-of-way or easement or portion thereof in which the sewer or sewer system is laid according to the provisions of section 62 or section 62-a, as the case may be. Such certificates shall be issued in the following number of installments. 
    Where the assessment shall not exceed fifty dollars, the assessment and certificate issued thereon shall be in one amount, due and payable in ninety days from the completion and acceptance of the work; if over fifty dollars and not more than one hundred dollars, then such amount shall be covered by only two certificates of equal amounts, payable in ninety days and one year, respectively; if over one hundred dollars and not more than one hundred and fifty dollars, then such amount shall be covered by only three certificates of equal amounts payable in ninety days, one year and two years, respectively; if over one hundred and fifty dollars and not more than two hundred dollars, then such amount shall be covered by only four certificates of equal amounts, payable in ninety days, one year, two years and three years, respectively; and if more than two hundred dollars, then in five certificates of equal amounts, payable in ninety days, one year, two years, three years and four years, respectively; and the term "equal amounts" herein shall mean as nearly equal as practicable, that is, four certificates being expressed in terms of blank dollars each, and, when practical, in multiples of five, the cents and odd amounts being covered by the first certificate. 
    Every such certificate shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular lot against which it is assessed in the same way and manner that assessments are liens under sections 62 and 62-a of this act [this Charter]. And nothing in this act, or in the Charter of the City of Charleston shall be construed as imposing a time limit upon the enforcement by appropriate suit of any lien for public improvements heretofore or hereafter created. 
    Certificates authorized by this section may be issued, sold or negotiated to the contractor doing the work, or to any other person if the council deem it expedient; and shall be negotiable at any bank in the City of Charleston; provided, the city in issuing such certificates shall not be held as guarantor or in any way liable for the payment thereof. Certificates so issued shall contain a provision to the effect that in the event of default in the payment of any one of said certificates when due, said default continuing for a period of sixty days, unpaid certificates shall become due and payable and the holder of said certificates may proceed to collect all of such unpaid certificates in the manner hereinbefore provided. 
    Provided, that no sewer or sewer system shall be constructed or laid pursuant to this section except and unless two-thirds of the members elected to the council shall concur in the passage of the ordinance providing therefor, and the vote thereon shall be taken by ayes and noes, and duly entered upon the record. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 88-b are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code §§ 8-13-1, 8-16-1 et seq., 8-17-1 et seq. and 8-18-1 et seq. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 88-c. - Subdividing abutting land for purpose of making assessments. 
    If the abutting land on any avenue, street, road or alley sought to be graded, paved, repaved or otherwise improved, or on any avenue, street, road, alley, right-of-way or easement in which a sewer or sewer system is ordered laid, under any of the provisions of the Charter of the City of Charleston, is not subdivided or laid off in lots by a map or deed of record, the council may, for the purpose of making the assessments provided for in this section and other sections herein, subdivide said land into lots of such size as the council deems advisable for the purpose of laying the proper assessment against such land. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 88-c are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code §§ 8-13-1, 8-16-1 et seq., 8-17-1 et seq. and 8-18-1 et seq. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 89. - Initiation of ordinances by voters. 
    Any proposed ordinance, or amendment to any ordinance already in effect, may be submitted to the city council by the petition of qualified voters in said city, but such petition must be signed by such number of voters as shall amount to at least ten percent of the number of votes cast for the office of mayor at the last preceding municipal election. Such proposed ordinance, or amendment to an ordinance, shall be passed without alteration or change by the city council within thirty days after such petition is filed, or the city council shall, in lieu of passing such ordinance or amendment to an ordinance, submit such proposed ordinance, or amendment to an ordinance, in the manner hereinafter prescribed for ratification or rejection to the qualified voters of the city at the next regular municipal election which is to be held not less than sixty days after such petition is filed. If such petition contains a request for a special election and is signed by sufficient qualified voters to equal in number at least fifteen percent of the votes so cast for the office of mayor at the last preceding regular municipal election, the ordinance or amendment thereby proposed shall be passed by the city council without amendment or change, within thirty days after such petition is filed, or the city council shall submit such proposed ordinance or amendment for ratification or rejection to the qualified votes at a special election which shall be called within thirty days and held not less than sixty nor more than ninety days after such petition is filed, unless a general or special election is fixed by law to be held within said period of time. In the latter event, said proposed ordinance or amendment shall be submitted for ratification or rejection at such election. The city council shall cause such proposed ordinance or amendment to be printed and published in some newspaper of general circulation in the city once each week from the time the council decides to submit the same to the voters until such election is held. No ordinance or amendment to an ordinance adopted by the voters at any such election shall be repealed or amended by the city council. 
    The ballot used for any such election shall have printed on it the title of each ordinance, or amendment to an ordinance, submitted for ratification or rejection and on separate lines under said title the words "for said ordinance" and "against said ordinance" (or the amended part thereof, as the case may be). If a majority of the qualified voters of the city voting on any proposed ordinance, shall vote in favor thereof, the same shall thereupon become a valid ordinance and be in full force and effect at the expiration of the period of ten days from and after said election. If two or more ordinances, or amendments to ordinances, adopted at the same election are inconsistent, then the respective ordinance, or amendment to an ordinance, receiving the largest affirmative vote at such election shall prevail, and the form of submission of inconsistent ordinances, or parts thereof, or amendments to ordinances, shall be in such form that the voters may clearly express their choice. 
Sec. 90. - Reconsideration of ordinance protested by petition; submission of ordinances to voters. 
    If within the period of five days after the passage of any ordinance a petition signed by sufficient qualified voters of said city, being in number at least fifteen percent of the votes cast for all the candidates for the office of mayor at the last preceding regular municipal election, shall be filed protesting against such ordinance, or any part thereof, taking effect, such ordinance, or such part thereof so protested against, shall thereupon and thereby be suspended from taking effect, and the city council shall immediately again consider the same, and if it be not repealed or so amended as to meet the requirements of the said protest, the city council shall submit the same for ratification or rejection to the qualified voters of the city at the next regular municipal election which shall be held not more than thirty days after such petition is filed, or at a special election to be called thereafter by the city council for that purpose to be held in not less than sixty days nor more than ninety days after such petition is filed, and such ordinance, or part thereof so protested, shall not take effect unless a majority of the votes cast at such election thereon shall be for the ratification thereof. If such petition shall only be signed by sufficient qualified voters to equal in number at least five percent but not sufficient to equal in number at least fifteen percent of the votes cast for the candidate for said office of mayor at the last preceding municipal election, the city council shall submit such ordinance, or such part thereof so protested, for ratification or rejection at the next ensuing regular municipal election which is to be held more than thirty days after such petition is filed. The city council may, on its own motion, without any petition being required therefor, submit at a regular or special municipal election any ordinance passed by it in the same manner and with the same force and effect as hereinbefore provided. No ordinance, or part of an ordinance, rejected at any election shall be enacted or passed by the city council within the period of twelve months thereafter. 
Sec. 91. - Recall of officers. 
    Any officer of the City of Charleston elected by the voters under the provisions of this act [this Charter], may be recalled and the office declared vacant as provided in this act. Such officer may be removed from office by a recall election held thereunder, but no such officer shall be removed from office within the period of four months after he enters upon the discharge of his duties as such. Before any such recall election shall be held a petition, stating the name or names and the office or the officer or officers sought to be recalled, and signed by sufficient qualified voters of the said city as shall equal in number the quantity of twenty-five percent of the votes in the whole city or in the ward, as the case may be, for all the candidates for the office of mayor at the last preceding regular municipal election, and containing a sworn statement of the grounds upon which it is sought to remove the said officer or officers, shall be filed with the city clerk. No such petition shall be filed within the period of six months before the end of the term of such officer. The city council shall immediately, upon the filing of said petition, call a special election in the manner in this act [this Charter] provided for calling special elections and submit to the voters the question of recalling such officer or officers. The ballot at such election, with respect to each person whose recall is sought, shall be substantially as follows: "Shall (name of person) be removed from the office (name of office) by recall?" Immediately following such question there shall be on the printed ballot the two propositions in the order set forth: 
"For the recall of (name of person)." 
"Against the recall of (name of person)." 
    Immediately to the left of said proposition shall be printed a square in which the voters, by marking a cross mark (X), or in some other way declaring their intention, may vote for either of such propositions. If sixty percent of the voters registered voting on said propositions vote in favor of the recall of such officer or officers, then he or they shall thereby be forthwith removed from such office and such vacancy or vacancies shall be filled as provided in this act; provided, however, that within fifteen days after the returns of such recall election shall have been canvassed by the city council, a petition signed by sufficient qualified voters to equal in number at least thirty percent of the votes cast in the city, or ward, as the case may be, for the candidates for the office of mayor at the last preceding regular municipal election, and praying that such vacancy or vacancies be filled by a special election to be held not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days thereafter, the city council shall order a special election to be held in the same manner as other special elections are provided for in this act for the purpose of filling such vacancy or vacancies. 
Editor's note- It appears that the 25 percent figure in Charter § 91 should be 20 percent. See W. Va. Code § 8-12-4(3). 
Sec. 92. - Signatures and affidavits to petitions filed under three preceding sections; form of submission of ordinance; all city elections to conform to state law. 
    The signatures to petitions filed under the provisions of the last three sections [§§ 89-91] need not be all on one paper or one sheet of paper, but separate petitions may be circulated and signed and the aggregate number of names on all of such petitions, if equal to the number required in this act [this Charter], shall be sufficient. The circulator of each paper shall make and append thereto an affidavit that each signature thereon is the signature of the person whose name it purports to be. The residence address of each signer shall accompany the signature. All such petitions shall be filed with the city clerk and shall be deemed and held to be sufficient if they appear to be signed by the requisite number of signers and such signers shall be deemed and held to be qualified voters, unless a protest in writing, under oath, shall be filed with the city clerk by some qualified voter within fifteen days after such petitions are filed, which protest shall set forth the name of each signer protested against and the ground therefor. It shall be the duty of the city clerk as soon as possible and within twenty-four hours after the filing of such protest to mail a notice to each signer so protested against at his address as given in the petition, requiring him to be and appear before the city registrars at a time fixed in said notice, not less than twenty-four hours nor more than forty-eight hours after the mailing of such notice, for the purpose of defending his right to sign said petition. If it shall be proven by satisfactory evidence that such person is not a qualified signer of such petition, then his name shall be stricken therefrom. All evidence taken shall be under oath, and any signer present at the hearing may be called as a witness by the protestant or testify in his own behalf. All hearings shall be summary and shall be concluded within fifteen days after such petition is filed. The city registrars [see § 9] shall forthwith certify the result of their examination to the city clerk and such city clerk shall serve a copy of such certificate upon the person or persons named in the petition as representing the signers thereof. When the petition contains a sufficient number of qualified signatures the city registrars shall forthwith file the same with the city clerk, and he shall transmit the same to the city council, which shall call an election as provided for in the three preceding sections [§§ 89-91] of this act [this Charter]. All petitions filed in the city clerk's office shall be public records. When any petition contains a form of submission of the ordinance petitioned for and such form is a reasonably fair description thereof, the same shall be placed on the ballot and no petition filed subsequently shall be permitted to use any form of submission that is so similar to the one previously filed as to tend to confuse the voter, and, in case of such conflict, the person presenting the subsequent petition may file a form of submission which shall be placed upon the ballot, provided, the same shall fairly describe the ordinance, or amendment to an ordinance, petitioned for and shall not be in conflict with any prior forms of submission or tend to confuse the voter. 
    The city council shall so frame all forms of submission that the voter can, by making a cross in a square in front of some appropriate words, vote either for the ratification or the rejection of the proposed measure, but no ballot shall be rejected from which the reasonable intention of the voter however he shall have marked the same, can be ascertained. All city elections, regular or special, shall conform as nearly as possible to the election statutes contained in chapter 3 of the Code of West Virginia. 
Sec. 93. - Additional method for construction of sidewalks; assessment certificates. 
    In addition to the method of securing the laying of sidewalks set out in section 49 of this chapter [this Charter], the council of said city may cause any sidewalk to be constructed, laid, relaid, or otherwise permanently improved in the City of Charleston in the following manner and upon the following terms: Plans and specifications shall be prepared and filed, resolutions and ordinances shall be adopted and notices shall be prepared and served in the same way and manner as near as may be, as in the case of the paving and improvement of streets and alleys. The contract for same shall, after due advertisement in which council shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids, be let to the lowest responsible bidder and upon completion and acceptance of the work, council shall order the mayor and city clerk to issue to the contractor doing the work a certificate for the amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such sidewalk, and the amount specified in said assessment certificate shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or part of a lot fronting on such sidewalk as well as a debt against the owner of said lot, and such certificate shall draw interest from the date of said assessment, and the payment may be enforced in the name of the holder of such certificate by a proper suit in equity in any court having proper jurisdiction to enforce such liens, and council shall fix the amount of such assessments and do all things in connection therewith necessary to make them valid and do all other things in connection therewith as is provided for paving or improving streets and alleys and such certificates shall be issued one for each abutting lot or portion thereof payable six months from the date of the completion and acceptance of the work and shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular lot against which they are assessed in the same way and manner that assessments for street paving are liens under the other provisions of the aforesaid act creating and amending the Charter of the City of Charleston; providing, however, that council shall not order any but concrete sidewalks; and, provided, further, that council shall not advertise for bids for any one letting of less than five thousand square feet; and, further, provided, that council shall not receive any bids or let any sidewalk contract between the first day of October and the first day of March of any year. Nothing in this section shall be so construed as to prevent any abutting lot owner from having his own sidewalk put in if done before the advertising hereinbefore mentioned and provided same is done according to the lines, grades and specifications of the city engineer, for which no charge shall be made. The total cost of constructing, laying, relaying, or otherwise permanently improving any sidewalk or walks shall be borne by the owners of the land abutting upon said sidewalk or sidewalks according to the following plan, that is to say, payment is to be made according to the proportion of square feet in front of any lot or portion thereof bears to the whole letting. The contract for sidewalks referred to in this section does not necessarily have to be one continuous sidewalk, but the five thousand square feet required for a letting as aforesaid may be made up of or composed of any number of sidewalks in any parts of the city. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 93 are preempted to general law by W. Va. Code §§ 8-13-1, 8-16-1 et seq., 8-17-1 et seq. and 8-18-1 et seq. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 93-a. - Transcript of property to be furnished by county assessor. 
    The county assessor shall furnish transcript of real and personal property on or about the tenth day of September of each year and his fee for same shall be not less than four hundred nor more than one thousand dollars for such work. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 93-a are superseded by W. Va. Code § 11-3-6. 
Sec. 94. - Authority to issue warrants; vacancy in office of municipal judge. 
    The municipal judge, mayor, city clerk, municipal court clerk, chief of police, or in the absence of the chief of police, the captains of police and lieutenants of police shall each have authority to issue warrants for all offenses committed within the police jurisdiction of the City of Charleston. Any vacancy in the office of municipal judge shall be filled by appointment by the mayor until the next election. 
Editor's note- To the extent that Charter § 94 relates to various officials of the police department, it is superseded by W. Va. Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2, 8-10-4. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. This section is also invalid to the extent that it applies to other than ordinance violations. See W. Va. Code §§ 8-10-1, 8-10-2, 8-10-4; State ex rel. Hill v. Smith, 305 S.E.2d 771 (W. Va. 1983). See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 95. - Statement of claim before action against city for damages for personal injury. 
    No action shall be maintained against the City of Charleston for damages for a personal injury alleged to have been sustained by reason of the negligence of the city or of any officer, agent or employee thereof, unless a written verified statement of the nature of the claim and of the time and place at which such injury is alleged to have been received shall have been filed with the city clerk within thirty days after the cause of action shall have accrued. The cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of the sustaining of the injury, except that where death results therefrom the time for the personal representative to give notice shall run from the date of death. An action at law for damages for personal injuries or death shall not be commenced until the expiration of thirty days after the filing of the notice as provided in this section. 
Editor's note- The provisions of Charter § 95 are superseded by W. Va. Code § 8-12-20. See W. Va. Code § 8-1-6. 
Sec. 96. - Health commissioner. 
    The health commissioner shall be a physician of good standing in his profession and may devote his time to city work alone. It shall be his duty to administer to all charity cases that he may, in his discretion, deem deserving. He shall, in conjunction with the city manager, have charge of the general health and sanitation of the city and it shall be his duty to carefully investigate all complaints and make a careful detailed report of all his official acts as health commissioner to the city manager and council at least once every month. He shall be appointed in the way and manner provided in the Charter of the City of Charleston and shall receive such salary as council may by ordinance prescribe. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as in any way affecting the police officers of the city relative to their powers and duties in regard to city sanitation contained and set forth elsewhere [see § 85] in said Charter.

(m)  Undertakings permitted, funded, licensed or otherwise assisted by the state shall be reviewed in accordance with W. Va. Code § 29-1-5e [and] shall be considered exempt from review for certification of appropriateness as described in this section.

ARTICLE VIII. - CITY SERVICE FEE 

Sec. 2-734. - Findings. 
(a)  The city council of the city finds that the city provides to all individuals within its borders certain services, whether they are residents employed within the city, or individuals living outside the city and employed within the corporate boundaries of the city. 
(b)  The city council of the city finds that such services include police protection and traffic and street maintenance. 
(c)  The city council of the city finds that such services are within the authority and are the responsibility of the Municipal Government of the City of Charleston as provided under the general laws of the State of West Virginia. 
(d)  The city council of the city finds that since such services are essential to the creation and maintenance of those jobs which provide livelihood to all individuals employed within the city, as well as to the property interests of residents and visitors to the city, it is therefore reasonable to derive a portion of the cost of providing and maintaining such services from said individuals. 
(e)  The city council of the city finds that W. Va. Code § 8-13-13 provides that every municipality has the plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for the installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such services, to make reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance upon the users of such services reasonable rates, fees and charges to be collected in the manner prescribed in the ordinance. 
(f)  The city council of the city finds that all of those individuals, who use, enjoy and benefit from these services, should bear an equitable share of the costs thereof. 
(g)  The city council of the city finds that the imposition of the city service fee established herein is a reasonable system of distributing the costs to all of the users that the city can reach through reasonable and prudent means and legislation.

If service is made by certified mail pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1)(D) and delivery of the notice of the violation is refused, the enforcement official, promptly upon the receipt of the notice of such refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, (1) a copy of the notice of the violation(s) (2) a notice that despite such refusal, the notice of the violation(s) is valid, and (3) advising that the City will proceed to enforce the notice of violation(s).

g.  The maximum fines that may be assessed if the violation is not corrected; and 
h.  The name, address and telephone number of the enforcement official issuing the notice of violation. 
(d)  Issuance of citations.

Proof of service shall be made at the time of service by a written declaration, under oath, executed by the enforcement official effecting service and shall declare the time, date and manner by which service was made.

(f)  Nonpayment of fines. All fines imposed by citations under this section shall be due within ten days of service of the citation except as otherwise set forth herein. The failure to pay when due any fine imposed under this section shall constitute a failure to appear or otherwise respond under WV Code 8-10-2b(c) and may result in notification to the DMV. 
(g)  Repeat violations. If a person has been previously served with a notice of violation for a violation contained in subsection 3-26(a)(3), whether or not the violation is timely corrected or a citation is issued, he shall not be entitled to receive an additional notice(s) of violation for the same category of violation if the same category of violation is repeated within a six-month period of the issuance of either a notice of violation or a citation, the enforcement official may proceed in accordance with subsection 3-26(d) without further notice to the violator. 
(h)  Appeal. 
(1)  Any person who is issued a citation shall pay the fine indicated for the violation, as set forth in subsection 3-26(e), in full to the office of the city collector within ten days of service of the citation. Any person alleging he or she was improperly issued such citation may, within ten days of service of such citation, file a petition for appeal of the citation, along with the required bond, with the municipal court clerk in accordance with the following: 
a.  In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation, within ten days of service of the citation, the recipient of the citation shall pay the required amount of the applicable fine in full to the municipal court clerk, which amount will be held by the municipal court as bond pending hearing and resolution of the case by the municipal court and the municipal court clerk shall issue a receipt to the recipient of the citation showing the amount of the bond paid. In addition to the bond, the recipient of the citation shall file with the municipal court clerk a petition for appeal of the citation. If any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the recipient of the citation shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the citation, and such petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed; provided, however, that nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the municipal court judge from finding, upon a proper application and showing, that the recipient of the citation suffers from financial hardship, and, as a result, waiving the requirement that the bond be posted. 
b.  Any petition for appeal filed with the municipal court clerk must be in writing, on the form to be provided by the municipal court clerk, and must be signed by the recipient of the citation affirming that the contents of the petition are true and accurate to the best of the recipient of the citation's knowledge at that time. Such petition for appeal shall state the facts and reasons in support of the petition. Upon filing any such petition for appeal with the municipal court clerk, the recipient of the citation shall serve a copy of the petition and receipt showing proof of bond, or application for waiver thereof, upon the city attorney. 
(2)  Upon filing of a petition for appeal with the municipal court clerk, the clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the municipal court docket, set the case for hearing within 30 days from the date of the filing of the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the recipient of the citation, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement official who issued the citation. Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement official shall cause a copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the municipal court clerk who shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation indicated therein. 
(3)  The municipal court shall treat the citation itself as the original complaint before the court. At the close of all of the evidence presented at the hearing on the petition for appeal, should the municipal judge find against the recipient of the citation, the bond posted by the recipient of the citation shall be applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation. In the event the municipal court judge finds that the recipient of the citation suffers from financial hardship, the municipal court judge may permit alternative sentencing pursuant to section 38-126 of the Municipal Code. Should the court find in favor of the recipient of the citation, the bond, if applicable, shall be refunded to the recipient of the citation by the municipal court clerk, and the citation shall be dismissed.

If the owner does not appear to claim the animal within the ten-day period, then the owner shall be deemed to have forfeited all interest in the animal, the animal shall be deemed abandoned, and all interest in the animal shall vest to the humane association for adoption or other disposition.

Sec. 14-201. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city has determined that uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings (i) present a fire hazard; (ii) are often utilized by vagrants and transients (including drug abusers and traffickers) as dangerous and unsafe temporary shelters; (iii) detract from private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings; and (iv) require additional regulation and services to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(b)  Owners of vacant buildings shall register such vacant buildings with the city, make payment of a fee as set forth herein, and otherwise conform to the requirements of this vacant structure code. 
(c)  It is the intent of this article that, through a registration, inspection, and monitoring process, and other improved public safety efforts, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding properties, and will not otherwise present a public hazard. 
(d)  It is the city's further intent for the provisions of this article to streamline and consolidate the existing procedure (that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens, appeals and lien enforcement) by placing the responsibility to register and maintain a vacant structure on the owner of a building before a condition of the building falls into disrepair or otherwise necessarily warrants a complaint.

(b)  Failure to correct violations within the time period specified by the code enforcement officer may result in an immediate revocation of the residential rental license for that rental unit and may further subject the owner to the penalties set forth in section 18-1185 of this article, and any other penalties permitted under this Code. No residential rental license shall be revoked for failure to remedy a condition so long as the owner or responsible local agent is, in the discretion of the code enforcement officer, acting with due diligence and taking bona fide steps to correct the violation, including, but not limited to, pursuing remedies under a lease agreement with a tenant. 
(c)  Code enforcement officers may, in their discretion, perform one or more re-inspections of a rental unit in which violations have occurred for the purpose of verifying corrective action. If, in the discretion of the code enforcement officer, required repairs can reasonably be made at the time of inspection, no re-inspection will be required and no re-inspection fee will be charged.

If the contract, or written statement of the nature of the arrangement to prevail in the absence of a contract between a professional solicitor and a charitable, religious, educational or benevolent organization does not provide for compensation on a percentage basis, the director shall examine the contract to ascertain whether the compensation to be paid in such circumstances is likely to exceed 15 percent of the total money, pledges or other property raised or received as a result of the contract or arrangements; if the reasonable probabilities are that compensation will exceed 15 percent of the total money, pledges or other property, the director shall not issue a permit as provided in section 26-33. 
(Code 1975, § 10-13) 
Sec. 26-33. - Investigation of permit application; issuance or denial of permit; appeals. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the director to investigate all applications of persons desiring to solicit funds for charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes; and if the director, after such investigation, is satisfied that the purpose of such solicitation is a bona fide charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purpose, that the applicant for the permit will solicit in good faith and in the manner authorized for such bona fide charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes and that a proper proportion of the money subscribed or contributed will be used for the purpose for which the subscription or contribution is made, it shall be the duty of the director to issue to such applicant a card giving the name of the person so authorized to solicit, the purpose for which the funds are being solicited, the time within which solicitations of money, contributions or subscriptions are permitted, the manner in which such solicitation is authorized and whether the person soliciting funds is being paid for his services as such solicitor. It shall not be necessary for each solicitor to apply to the director where more than one person is soliciting for the same purpose, but a general application for such persons may be made by any one of them, and cards for all such solicitors may be issued upon one application. If the director, after investigation of any application for a permit to solicit funds, decides that such permit should not be issued, the director shall decline to issue such permit; and the person whose application has been declined by the director shall have the right of appeal to the board of solicitation review. The board shall hear and determine the application and appeal at any open meeting, after notice to the applicant and appellant; and the decision of a majority of the members of the board, after such hearing, shall be binding on all of the parties. 
(b)  An appeal from the decision of the board may be taken before the city council, which shall, in such instances, have the power to sustain or reverse the decision of the board; but no appeal to the city council shall be recognized as such until after notice of such appeal has been published in at least one newspaper in the city for ten consecutive days. At the time of such hearing, the director shall be present to furnish the council with full information in support of the board's decision. 
(Code 1975, § 10-14) 
Sec. 26-34. - Card or certificate from director required. 
    Any person conducting a campaign or soliciting money, subscriptions or contributions for any charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes upon the streets, in public places, in buildings and from house to house, or by the use of the telephone, or otherwise in the city shall have and exhibit at all times when soliciting such funds a card or certificate from the director. The card shall authorize such person to solicit money, subscriptions or contributions for such purposes, in the manner and at the time when such solicitation of funds is made. Any person soliciting funds, subscriptions or contributions without such permit or certificate duly issued by the director or in any manner not authorized by the director shall be guilty of an offense against this section. 
(Code 1975, § 10-15) 
Sec. 26-35. - Suspension or cancellation of permit; jurisdiction of municipal court to issue subpoenas duces tecum. 
    In the event of violation of the conditions, limitations or restrictions imposed in the granting of any permit provided for in this article, or in the event of the misapplication of any funds collected thereunder, the director may suspend the effectiveness of the permit pending a hearing before the board as to whether or not any condition, limitation or restriction imposed by the director in the granting of such permit has been violated. Such suspension of the permit shall be in effect only until the hearing before the board, upon reasonable notice, at which hearing the holder of the permit may appear before the board, in person or by counsel, and may produce evidence. The board is authorized to hear testimony and swear witnesses, and the municipal court or the municipal judge is hereby authorized to issue subpoenas duces tecum upon application and proper showing being made by the board, such subpoenas to be served by any police officer of the city. If upon the hearing the board shall determine that this chapter has been violated, or any condition, limitation or restriction imposed in any permit has been violated, the board may cancel the permit or may suspend its effectiveness for such time as the board may deem advisable. The board shall make a written finding of the facts, based upon the testimony heard by it; and its finding as to the facts shall be conclusive. 
(Code 1975, § 10-16) 
Sec. 26-36. - Fees and bonds. 
(a)  Any application for permission to solicit funds shall be accompanied by a fee of $10.00. Once permission to solicit is obtained, any person or organization other than a professional solicitor shall post a cash bond of $250.00. Professional solicitors shall post a cash bond of $1,000.00 or ten percent of the total money, pledges and other property to be raised or received by reason of solicitation activities, whichever is less, but in no event less than $250.00. Such cash bond shall be refunded to the person or organization; provided, that such person or organization shall, within 45 days after the completion of the fundraising campaign, notify the director with a financial report stressing the amount raised, expenses of the campaign and projected use of the proceeds raised. 
(b)  Where multiple fundraising campaigns are conducted simultaneously by the same person or organization, the director may, in his discretion, not require a separate cash bond to be posted for each campaign. In no event, however, may all cash bond money posted by any person or organization be returned until all fundraising campaigns of that person or organization have been completed and the director has been so notified with a proper financial report.

(1)  Such person or family, because of financial conditions, age, infirmity, family size or other reasons, is unable to obtain, on suitable terms and conditions, loans or other credit necessary for the rehabilitation of such eligible dwelling, and hence requires the assistance as provided in this article; 
(2)  Such rehabilitation is necessary to place such eligible dwelling in a safe, sanitary and decent condition; and 
(3)  The assistance as authorized in this article shall make financing available to such person or family, or enable such person or family to obtain such financing, on terms and conditions substantially more favorable to such person or family than would otherwise be available.

(Code 1975, § 5-71) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 30-62. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds and declares that there has been for a number of years a clear trend for younger and more affluent persons and families residing in the city to move their residences from the inner urban areas of the city to newer suburban areas; that as a result, a disproportionate number of homeowners remaining in such inner urban areas are older, less affluent and otherwise less able to afford the expense of the remodeling, repairing and rehabilitating of their residences necessary to maintain such residences in a sanitary, safe and decent condition; that because of their lack of acceptable loan collateral, the age of their residences and the location and age of the neighborhoods in which their residences are located, many of such homeowners have not been able to borrow funds necessary to effect such remodeling, repair and rehabilitation; and that some homeowners who have been able to borrow funds for such purposes have been able to do so only upon rates of interest and upon other terms and conditions which are particularly onerous to such homeowners. 
(b)  The city council further finds and declares that the assistance authorized by this article will provide and will encourage private lenders to provide to such homeowners, more readily and at rates of interest and upon other terms and conditions significantly more favorable to such homeowners, the loans necessary to finance the cost of such remodeling, repair and rehabilitation. 
(c)  The city council further finds and declares that it is manifestly in the public interest to foster, in the populous inner urban areas of this city, the pride, self-respect and esteem incident to home ownership and to encourage and assist in the maintenance of residences situated in such areas in a safe, decent and sanitary condition; that without the assistance authorized in this article, there will be continued deterioration of such inner urban areas with the resultant proliferation of urban decay and slums, higher crime rates and general decline in civic pride, public spirit and the quality of life, with all of the public cost, direct and indirect, attendant thereon; and that accordingly by providing such assistance the city will be acting in all respects for the benefit of its citizens and shall thereby serve a public purpose in improving and otherwise promoting their health, welfare and prosperity. 
(Code 1975, § 5-70) 
Sec. 30-63. - Neighborhood rehabilitation fund; guaranteed loans. 
(a)  There is established a special fund of moneys to be made available by appropriation, grant, contribution, loan or otherwise, to be known as the "Neighborhood Rehabilitation Fund of the City of Charleston." Such neighborhood rehabilitation fund shall be administered and accounted for as a special purpose account, separate and distinct from any other moneys or funds owned by the city. 
(b)  The city council shall from time to time, by resolution, establish criteria which shall govern the determination of persons and families who qualify as eligible residents. 
(c)  The purpose of such neighborhood rehabilitation fund shall be to provide funds for the making of loans, or to guarantee the repayment of loans made by private lenders, to eligible residents of the city, the proceeds of which loans are to be used exclusively for rehabilitation. 
(d)  Such loans shall be made or guaranteed only upon determination by the city council, or by the rehabilitation fund commission, that the borrowers are eligible residents; that the proceeds of the loan shall be used for rehabilitation; and that loans to such eligible borrowers for rehabilitation are not otherwise available upon reasonable equivalent terms and conditions. 
(e)  No loan shall be made or guaranteed by the city except in accordance with a written agreement between such city, the eligible resident and, in the case of a guaranteed loan, the lender making such loan, which agreement shall provide without limitation that: 
(1)  The proceeds of such loan shall be used exclusively for rehabilitation. 
(2)  The loan shall be in such principal amount, repayable in such number of consecutive and substantially equal monthly installments, at such annual rate of interest and shall be secured in such manner as specified in such agreement. 
(3)  In the case of a guaranteed loan, the city shall, at its option and in accordance with predefined criteria, repay, from the neighborhood rehabilitation fund established in accordance with this article, any installment or installments of such loan as shall be in default. If the city chooses not to make such repayment, the lender may foreclose on the security for the loan and the city shall pay to such lender, from the neighborhood rehabilitation fund, the amount, if any, by which the unpaid balance of the loan, including accrued interest, exceeds the proceeds of such foreclosure. 
(4)  If the city incurs an obligation on a guaranteed loan under the provisions of subsection (e)(3) of this section, the city shall be entitled, at its option, to realize on any and all security for such loan; provided; that the right of the city to realize on such security with respect to a guaranteed loan shall be subordinate and secondary to the right of the lender as to such security, to the extent of the unpaid balance of such loan. If the city incurs an obligation on a guaranteed loan under the provisions of subsection (e)(3) of this section, the city shall be subrogated to the right of the lender against the eligible resident to the extent of all payments made by the city to the lender with respect to such loan. 
(f)  Nothing contained in this article shall be so construed as to authorize the city to make any contract or incur any obligation or liability of any kind or nature, except such as shall be discharged or payable solely from the funds on deposit in such neighborhood rehabilitation fund. 
(Code 1975, § 5-72) 
Sec. 30-64. - Rehabilitation fund commission. 
    There is created a commission to be known as the "Charleston Rehabilitation Fund Commission," which shall be comprised of three members, no more than two members of the same political party, who shall be appointed by and serve at the will and pleasure of the mayor. The commission shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  To determine the eligibility of applicants for loans from or to be guaranteed by the neighborhood rehabilitation fund in accordance with criteria as established from time to time by the council by resolution, and to ensure that the proceeds of such loans are used for rehabilitation, and that loans to such eligible residents for rehabilitation are not otherwise available upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions. 
(2)  At the request of eligible residents, to cause inspections to be made of their residences, to make recommendations concerning rehabilitation and to provide all manner of technical services and assistance in the planning, processing and design of needed rehabilitation. 
(3)  To cause to be prepared all forms of loan agreements, promissory notes, deeds of trust and other agreements and instruments as such commission shall deem necessary for the implementation of such program. 
(4)  To negotiate with banks, savings and loan associations and other lending institutions in the city and to obtain commitments from one or more of such institutions to provide loans to residents eligible to participate in such program, such loans to be guaranteed by the neighborhood rehabilitation fund. 
(5)  In general, to administer and coordinate the making and guaranteeing of loans from the neighborhood rehabilitation fund and to have such additional incidental powers and duties, including the hiring of consultants, as shall be necessary for the furtherance of the purposes of the neighborhood rehabilitation fund. 
(6)  To adopt rules and regulations for its government, to study housing problems existing in the city with reference to the need for and feasibility of rehabilitation loans and to advise city council as to such problems and the recommendations of the commission.

    Alarm user means any person whose business premises are protected by an alarm system within the city. 
    False alarm means an alarm not resulting from an unauthorized entry, robbery or where no other crime was committed or attempted at the premises.

(2)  The registration application shall provide the police department with a record of the company or firm that installed the alarm system, the names and telephone numbers of contact people (key holders) to call when an alarm is activated, and information concerning the maintenance and inspection of the alarm system. The registration application shall also confirm whether the alarm system includes an audible alarm (siren, etc.) and, if so, whether such alarm system has an automatic 15-minute shutoff switch. No registration pertaining to an alarm system having an audible alarm shall be deemed completed unless it confirms that such system also has an automatic shutoff switch as set forth in this section. The alarm user shall notify the police department of any changes in any information set forth in an application within 30 days of each such change. Failure to notify the police department of such changes shall result in a $100.00 fine.

(1)  The police department shall maintain records regarding false alarms for each alarm system for consecutive 12-month periods initially beginning on the date the alarm system is registered. 
(2)  After an alarm system is registered, the alarm user owning such alarm system shall be fined $100.00 upon the occurrence of the sixth false alarm recorded by such alarm system during any reporting period, and for each false alarm occurring thereafter during the same reporting period.

Sec. 50-81. - Legislative findings; statement of policy. 
(a)  The city council recognizes and declares that: 
(1)  Abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires, and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances are and constitute a public nuisance and hazard to both adults and children, and, therefore, are dangerous and constitute a clear and present danger; 
(2)  Such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve as harborage and breeding places for rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, mice, rats and other insects, pests and flies injurious to the public health, safety and general welfare; 
(3)  Abandoned motor vehicles and junked motor vehicles serve frequently as temporary or permanent places of human residence unconducive to public health, safety and welfare; 
(4)  The accumulation and storage of any such items or parts on private or public property, including but not limited to highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property and to promote blight and deterioration which, if permitted to remain, will continue to destroy the natural beauty of this city and have adverse economic and social effects; 
(5)  Such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances constitute an unattractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors; 
(6)  Such items are nearly always located on public highways or rights-of-way or within sight of such highway rights-of-way and on private property within a reasonable proximity, and when so located the cost of controlling or abating such visual pollution is a deterrent to economic development; and 
(7)  It is in the public interest and welfare to provide for a program to eliminate the unsightly practice of abandoning motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances. 
(b)  In view of these findings, the city council declares it to be the public policy of the city to eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires, and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances and to eliminate the visual pollution resulting from these items, and that in order to provide for the public health, safety, welfare and quality of life, to enact legislation to that end by providing expeditious means and methods for effecting the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires, and certain abandoned household appliances. The city council further finds and declares that the presence of an abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, old vehicle tire, or an abandoned or inoperative household appliance, or any part, on private or public property, including but not limited to highways, except as expressly permitted in this article, is a public nuisance injurious to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of this city, which shall be abated as such by the methods provided in this article.

The predominant usage of the structure is determined by the greatest usage of the total square footage by one or the other uses.

c.  Height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair, and other physical characteristics of the juvenile;

e.  Public place and date and hour involved; 
The chief of police or his designee may grant a permit in writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of this section. 
(12)  When authorized, by regulation issued by the chief of police or his designee in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled as set forth in subsection (d)(11) of this section but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the chief of police or his designee permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purpose of this section. 
(e)  Defense. It is a defense to prosecution under subsection (c)(3) of this section that the owner, operator or employee of an establishment promptly notified the police department that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during the restricted hours and refused to leave.

(e)  When the aggregate gross income of all persons residing in residential property, including single-family dwellings and multi-family dwelling units, maintained and occupied by a resident of the city during the preceding calendar year of the city, is less than $20,000.00, the rate for refuse may be reduced to $60.00 a year (or $5.00 per month); provided that the refuse fee account for which the reduced rate is requested is not in delinquent status, is current with no arrearage or penalties owed, has no delinquent fees or penalties due, and the resident who occupies such residential property makes an application for such reduced rate to the city collector and files therewith an affidavit evidencing the relevant facts required herein. If approved, the reduced rate and charges shall become effective with the first monthly billing after the filing of the affidavit; provided, however, that any approved reduced rate shall remain in effect for no more than one calendar year, or through June 30 of the year after which the affidavit is filed, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 102-217. - Mains and service wires. 
(a)  In bringing out of buildings mains which are to be supported by overhead service, the outlet must not be so located that the subsequent erection of an adjoining building might render it inaccessible. The main must be brought out at the front or rear wall, or along the street side if a corner building, and must be so placed that moisture cannot form a cross connection. Mains shall not be less than a foot apart, and shall not be in contact with any substance other than their insulation supports. Wooden blocks to which insulators are attached must be covered over the entire surface with at least two coats of waterproof paint. 
(b)  Fixtures to which insulators are attached must be covered over their entire surface with at least two coats of waterproof paint; when permitted, such fixtures must be at least seven feet above the highest point of flat roofs, and at least one foot above the ridge of pitched roofs over which they pass, or to which they are attached; but in new installations, service leads from poles to buildings must not enter buildings over the roof nor down the light shaft or court except with special permission and must be protected by dead insulated guard irons or wires from possibility of contact with other conducting wires or substances to which currents may leak. Special precautions of this kind must be taken where sharp angles occur or where any wires might possibly come in contact with electric light or power wires. 
(c)  Crosses, when unavoidable, must be made as nearly at right angles as possible; must be provided with petticoat insulators of glass or porcelain-porcelain knobs or cleats and rubber hooks will not be approved; and must be so spliced or joined as to be both mechanically and electrically secure without solder. The joints must then be soldered to ensure preservation, and covered with an insulation equal to that on the conductors. 
(d)  All joints must be soldered, even if made with some form of patent splicing device. This provision applies to joints and splices in all classes of wiring covered by this article and must, where they enter buildings, have drip loops outside; and the holes through which the conductors pass must be bushed with noncombustible, nonabsorptive, insulating tubes slanting upward toward the inside. 
(e)  For low potential systems the service wires may be brought into buildings through a single iron conduit, the conduit to be curved downward at its outer end and equipped with an approved service head to prevent the entrance of moisture. The outer end must be at least one foot from any woodwork, and the inner end must extend to the service cutout. 
(f)  Electric light or power wires must not be placed on the same crossarm with telegraph, telephone and similar wires; and when placed on the same pole with such wires, the distance between the two inside pins of each crossarm must not be less than 28 inches. 
(g)  The metallic sheaths to cables must be permanently and effectively connected to earth. 
(h)  Wires under sidewalks, especially likely to be injured, must be substantially protected. 
(i)  When wires come in contact with pipes, cornices, awning frames and covers, and places where bends occur outside of buildings, they must be protected by flexible metallic conduits running from one support to the other. The ends of the conduits must be equipped with an approved fitting. Flexible fibrous tubing will not be permitted on outside work. 
(Code 1975, § 21-6) 
Sec. 102-218. - Ground wires. 
    Ground wires must be kept outside of buildings so far as practicable, but may be directly attached to buildings or poles by cleats or straps or on porcelain knobs. Staples must never be used. The wire must be carried in as nearly a straight line as practicable, avoiding kinks, coils and sharp bends, and must be protected by a conduit wherever it is within eight feet of the ground.

Sec. 102-219. - High-tension wires. 
    If high-tension wires are carried on the same poles with other wires, the high-tension wires must be carried at least three feet above the other wires; and all reasonable precautions must be taken to prevent a breakdown. Wherever it is necessary to carry high-tension lines near any building, they must be located at such a distance from the building and at such a height as not to endanger the lives of firefighters who might be called to extinguish fire in any such building if compelled to fight the fire from the street or ladders on the outside of the building.

    All electrical construction of every kind and nature in the streets of the city over or through which a current of electricity passes or could pass shall conform in all respects to the standards and requirements of the electrical code and shall be equipped with all necessary appliances for the protection of life and property against any electrical current escaping from the wires or apparatus carrying or charged with the current, and for the protection of any person or property coming in contact with such wires and apparatus against injury from the current. 
(Code 1975, § 21-11) 
Sec. 102-223. - Poles, wires and electrical equipment to comply with article. 
    No person shall erect any poles, string any wires, or place any electrical equipment of any kind in the streets or other public places within the city unless the provisions of this article and all applicable provisions of the electrical code are fully complied with; and the city council shall have the power to order any person already occupying any such street or public place with any poles, wires or other electrical apparatus to remove, repair or reconstruct them in accordance with this article whenever, in the opinion of the city council, the safety of the traveling public and of the property of the citizens of the city requires any such removal, repair or reconstruction. This section shall not be construed, however, as impairing the obligations of any contract now in force between the city and any such person now lawfully occupying the streets of the city with poles or wires. 
(Code 1975, § 21-12) 
Sec. 102-224. - Municipal control of telephone, telegraph and electric companies.

(b)  If any person liable for any tax under section 110-52 or 110-53 shall ship or transport his products, or any part thereof, out of the city without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of the city shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in those sections. 
(c)  Gross income included in the measure of the tax under section 110-52 or 110-53, except in the production of natural gas, shall neither be added nor deducted in computing the tax levied under the other sections of this article. 
(d)  In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the relation between the buyer and the seller is such that the gross proceeds from the sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale, the value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied shall correspond as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and the seller but where the circumstances or conditions are otherwise similar. 
(e)  Sufficiency of contacts. The municipal business and occupation tax is imposed on each person engaged in privileges taxable under this article if such person is engaged in purposive revenue generating activities within the municipal limits of the city and such person has sufficient contacts to sustain the city's taxing jurisdiction.

(a)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the city in the business of severing, extracting, mining, quarrying, reducing to possession and/or producing for sale, profit or commercial use any natural resource products, the amount of such tax shall be equal of the value of the articles produced as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the producer, except as hereinafter provided, multiplied by the respective rates as follows: coal, one percent; limestone or sandstone quarried or mined, one percent; oil, one percent; natural gas in excess of the value of $5,000.00, one percent; blast furnace slag, one percent; sand gravel or other mineral products, not quarried or mined, one percent; timber one percent, and other natural resource products, one percent.

(d)  It is further provided, however, that in those instances in which the same person partially manufacturers, compounds or prepares products within the city and partially manufactures, compounds or prepares such products outside the city, the measure of his tax under this section shall be that proportion of the sales price of the product that the payroll costs of manufacturing within the city bears to the entire payroll costs of manufacturing the product. 
(e)  A person exercising any privilege taxable under this section and engaging in the business of selling his product at retail in the city shall be required to make returns of the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed in section 110-54 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such products at retail in the city.

Sec. 110-54. - Business of selling tangible property; certain sales exempt. 
(a)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the city in the business of selling any tangible property whatsoever, real or personal, including the sale of food in hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, confectioneries and other public eating houses and wholesale sales from a rolling stockpile, except sales of any person engaging or continuing in the business of horticulture, agriculture or grazing, or selling stocks, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness, there is hereby levied, and shall be collected, a tax equal to 5/10 of one percent of the gross income of the business; except, therein the case of selling at wholesale, the tax shall be equal to three-twentieths of one percent of the gross income of the business. 
(b)  Gross income or gross proceeds of sales derived from sales within West Virginia, which is not taxed or taxable by any other municipality are included in the measure of city business and occupation tax if the sales are either directed from a city location or the taxpayer's principal West Virginia office is located in the city. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, when the taxpayer has only one office location and this office is located within the municipal limits of the city and its activities elsewhere in West Virginia are neither taxed nor taxable by another municipality, the gross income or gross proceeds from those activities are taxable by the city. 
(c)  A person exercising any privilege taxable under section 110-53, and engaging in the business of selling his manufactured products in the city, shall be required to make returns of the gross proceeds of such wholesale sales and pay the tax imposed by this section at the rate of three-twentieths of one percent for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such manufactured products in the city. 
(d)  All sales of real estate (such as by a speculative builder) are sales at retail and must be reported accordingly. On sales of realty, the status of the purchaser or the intention or use made of the property by the purchaser is of no consequence to the vendor's tax status. To illustrate; where a speculative builder constructs apartment buildings which he later sells to a tax exempt entity, such sales must be reported at retail on the tax return of the speculative builder. 
(e)  Casual sales of real estate are not taxable to the vendor. 
(f)  Sales of tangible personal property made by vendors to persons engaging in exempt business activities (e.g., non profit hospitals and the activities of agriculture, horticulture, grazing) are not exempt sales and the gross income derived from such sales must be reported by the vendor under the retail classification. This rule results from the fact that the purchaser (non-profit hospital, farmer, etc.) is not engaged in a business subject to the municipal business and occupation tax. 
(g)  All sales made through vending machines are sales at retail. The term "vending machines" means and includes only those machines which, through the insertion of a coin of a specified amount, will return to the vendee a predetermined specific article of merchandise. It includes, but is not limited to, machines which vend cigarette, toilet articles, sandwiches, beverages, candies, confections, et cetera. 
(h)  Persons domiciled outside the city limits of the city who solicit sales within the city and sell tangible personal property of the city are doing business in the city, irrespective of the domicile of such persons irrespective of whether or not such persons maintain a permanent place of business in the city and irrespective of how a sales order is transmitted or processed. If an order is placed in connection with solicitation by a representative (regardless whether there is an employment or agency relationship or whether acting as an independent contractor) who solicits orders within the city, and the tangible personal property is to be delivered in the city, then the gross proceeds of such sales are included in the measure of the city's business and occupation tax.

    Upon any person engaging or continuing within the city in any public service or utility business, except railroad, railroad car, express, pipeline, telephone and telegraph companies, water carriers by steamboat or steamship and motor carriers, there are levied, and shall be collected, taxes on account of the business engaged in equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the respective rates as follows: Water companies, four percent; electric light and power companies, four percent on sales and demand charges for domestic and commercial lighting and three percent on sales and demand charges for all other purposes; natural gas companies, three percent of the gross income, such gross income for this purpose to be determined by deducting from gross income from all sales of gas to consumers the amount of the tax paid by the taxpayer under section 110-52 upon the production of the same gas; and upon all other public service or utility business, 2 35/100 percent. The measure of this tax shall not include gross income derived from commerce between the state and other states of the United States. The measure of the tax under this section shall include only gross income received from the supplying of public service. The gross income of the taxpayer from any other activity shall be included in the measure of the tax imposed upon such other activity by the appropriate section of this article. 
(Bill No. 6799, § 6-112, 1-22-2002) 
State Law reference- For corresponding provisions of state business and occupational tax law, see W. Va. Code § 11-13-2d. 
Sec. 110-56. - Business of contracting. 
(a)  Upon every person engaging or continuing within the city in the business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to two percent of the gross income of the business. A person performing any contracting activity shall report his/her gross income therefrom under the contracting classification of the municipal business and occupation tax return and shall receive no deduction from gross income on the account of any expenses incurred. All income derived from said activity shall be reported under the contracting classification, and the form of contract entered into by the parties shall not be determinative of taxable classification. 
(b)  Form of contract. Persons engaged in the contracting business shall report the entire gross income under the contracting classification, regardless of whether the contract is a turnkey contract, lump sum contract, per unit contract, cost plus fixed fee contract, or other contract having a similar basis. Gross income received from a contracting activity must be reported under the contracting classification and the manner of performance, basis of determining cost, fee or income or form of contract shall not alter the definition of contractor or of contracting and shall not change the taxability of such income from the contracting classification to another classification. A contracting activity remains a contracting activity regardless of what the parties may name it and regardless of the manner in which the parties may make payment and perform work. 
(c)  Costs. The measure of the tax under the contracting classification is gross income and includes all items of cost where the contractor has incurred liability. The cost of materials and labor can only be exempted from the measure of the tax in those cases where the contractor is not liable to vendors or workmen for payment. In those cases where the contractor contends that he/she has not incurred a municipal business and occupation tax liability because he/she acted solely as a agent for the owner, the burden of proving alleged principal-agency relationship shall be upon the contractor. 
(d)  Separate contracts for labor and materials. In cases where the contractor enters into a separate contract for the furnishing of materials by the contractor and a separate contract for erection of such materials by the contractor, the gross income from both contracts is taxable under the contracting classification, unless it can be provided by the contractor that passage of title of the materials was not dependent upon the erection of the materials by the contractor and that the sale of such materials is, in fact, a separate and distinct transaction, taxable under the municipal business and occupation tax law, as a retail or wholesale sale, as the case may be. The contract to furnish materials shall not be considered a separate and distinct transaction from the contract to erect the same, unless it is established by the contractor to be a complete arm's length transaction with no dependency existing between the contract for materials and the contract for erection. The burden of proving any alleged arm's length transaction shall be upon the contractor. 
(e)  Separate purchase orders. A separate purchase order for the furnishing of work or labor and a separate purchase order for the furnishing of materials which constitutes the contract(s) between the parties shall be treated in the same manner as set forth in the paragraph above. 
(f)  Prime and subcontractors. A prime contractor, one who furnishes work or both materials and work under a written or oral contract, for the construction, alteration, repair, decoration or improvement of a new or existing building or structure or any part thereof, or for the alteration, improvement or development of realty, must report his/her gross income under the contracting classification without any deduction on account of any expenses incurred. If the prime contractor executes a contract with another for a portion of the job or project, the prime contractor receives no deduction from gross income on account of any payment made to the subcontractor. The subcontractor will also be taxed on his/her gross income under the contracting classification. 
(g)  Contract entered into with government. Gross income received by a person for contracting activities performed for the State of West Virginia, the federal government or any of their instrumentalities, agencies, boards, commissions or political subdivisions, etc., or performed for nonprofit organizations is taxable and shall be reported under the contracting classification. The fact that the owner is a governmental unit or a non profit organization does not relieve the contractor, subcontractor, supplier or any other person from liability for municipal business and occupation tax on the full amount of gross income.

Each person subject to this regulation shall report gross income for the city municipal business and occupation tax purposes to reflect all gross income generated from loans originated and services provided to customers at or through each banking location within the municipal limits of the city and each such person's report shall fully reflect gross income earned from investments (other than loans) funded by deposits and repurchase agreements regularly maintained at or through each banking location within the municipal limits of the city. Other gross income shall be allocated in a reasonable manner that attributes all income to banking locations. No allocation methodology used to make such a report shall allocate or apportion gross income to locations other than a banking location. 
(2)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
a.  The phrase "banking location" (and all derivations thereof) means a physical facility maintained by a person engaged in banking business at which customers normally personally visit to conduct typical banking transactions, such as opening accounts, originating loans, making deposits, etc. 
b.  Gross income from loans is reportable (without adjustment, apportionment or allocation) to the banking location at which the loan originates. The transfer of loan files to a location outside of a municipality for processing or collection does not alter the taxability of the interest from such loans with respect to the banking location at which such loans originate. 
c.  Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or funded from deposits or repurchase agreements is reportable to banking location(s) in which deposits giving rise to the income are maintained, regardless of whether the investments function is managed or directed at a separate location. Deposits and repurchase agreements are considered maintained only at banking locations in accordance with reasonable procedures that reflect typical customer deposit activities and repurchase agreement relationships maintained at banking locations of the taxpayer subject to the approval of the city collector. Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or funded from sources other than deposits or repurchase agreements shall be reported to banking location(s) in a reasonable manner that fairly allocates all such gross income to banking locations. 
d.  Gross income from fees is reportable to the banking location at which the activity giving rise to the fee is primarily undertaken, using a reasonable method that fully reports fee income to one or more banking locations. 
(3)  The city collector of the city shall have authority to review and approve reasonable allocation methods in accordance with this ordinance. 
(4)  Each person subject to this regulation shall establish and maintain sufficient records for review by the city collector and his or her designee as long as the contents of such records may be material in the administration of the municipal business and occupation tax of the city along with such additional information as may otherwise be required. Each person subject to this regulation shall file reports on such forms designed from time to time by the city collector and shall follow all instructions in connection therewith.

Sec. 110-112. - Assessment of tax when insufficiently returned.

Assessments shall be served upon the taxpayer either personally or by certified mail. If any certified mail is refused or not claimed, the city collector may make service by first class mail and prepaid postage. 
(1)  Jeopardy assessments.

(b)  The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice, which petition and notice shall be serviced upon or accepted by the city collector as an original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it shall, with the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court and docketed as other cases, with the taxpayer as plaintiff and the city collector as defendant. The filing of the appeal shall not stay the collection of the tax. The collection of the tax shall be stayed if the plaintiff shall file with such clerk a bond for the use of the defendant, with sureties approved by the clerk, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the total amount of the tax, interest and penalties (to such date) appealed from, and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the court; provided, that the judge of the circuit court may stay the collection of the tax without the requirement of a bond, upon a proper showing by the taxpayer that the properties of the taxpayer are sufficient to secure performance of the court's orders or that the ends of justice will be served thereby.

Sec. 114-90. - Parking citation as prima facie evidence of offense; process to pay or contest parking citations. 
(a)  Issuance of a parking citation to an alleged violator of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the parking violation indicated on the face of the parking citation. As such, any person who is issued a parking citation must pay the fine indicated for the violation, as set forth in City Code subsection 114-3(c), in full to the cashier for the parking system within ten days of issuance; provided, however, that any person who feels he or she was improperly issued such parking citation may, within the ten days from issuance, file a motion to contest the parking citation along with the required bond with the municipal court clerk in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Prior to filing any motion to contest, the alleged violator must pay the required amount of the fine in full to the cashier for the parking system, which amount will be held by the parking system as bond pending evidentiary hearing before and resolution of the case by the municipal court; the cashier must issue a receipt to the alleged violator showing the amount of the bond paid. Thereafter, in order to properly and timely contest his or her citation, the alleged violator must file a copy of the bond receipt along with his or her motion to contest with the municipal court clerk within 10 days of issuance of the parking citation as set forth above. If any motion to contest filed in accordance with this section is not timely filed or is not accompanied with the required receipt showing payment of the required bond, the alleged violator shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to contest the citation, and such motion shall be summarily denied as untimely filed; provided, however, that nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the municipal court judge from finding upon proper showing that an alleged violator suffers from financial hardship, and, as a result, waiving the requirement that the bond be posted as a prerequisite to filing a motion to contest. 
(2)  Any motion to contest filed with the municipal court clerk must be in writing, on the form to be provided by the municipal court clerk, and must be signed by the alleged violator affirming that the contents of the motion are true and accurate to the best of the alleged violator's knowledge at that time. Such motion to contest must state the facts and reasons in support of the motion. Upon filing any such motion to contest with the municipal court clerk, the alleged violator must serve a copy of the motion and receipt showing proof of bond upon the city attorney. 
(b)  Upon filing of a motion to contest with the municipal court clerk, the clerk or his or her designee: shall place the case on the municipal court docket, set the case for evidentiary hearing, and provide a notice of hearing to the alleged violator; and shall forward a copy of the motion to the parking system director. Upon receipt of the motion, the parking system director shall cause a copy of the parking citation at issue to be forwarded to the municipal court clerk who shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation indicated therein. Further, if the alleged violator alleges as his or her reason for contesting that he or she is reporting a defective parking meter, then the parking system director shall cause an inspection of the meter to be made and a report to be generated setting forth the findings of the inspection, a copy of which will be forwarded to the municipal court clerk to be placed in the court file along with the motion to contest; if the meter is found defective, the parking citation shall be dismissed. 
(c)  The municipal court shall treat the parking citation itself as the original complaint before the court, and shall treat it as prima facie evidence of the parking violation alleged therein. As such, the alleged violator will bear the burden of overcoming the prima facie case at the evidentiary hearing. At the close of all of the evidence, should the municipal judge find against the alleged violator, the bond posted by the alleged violator will be applied as payment for the fine indicated for the violation, and the court may assess against the alleged violator appropriate court costs in an amount equal to the court costs generally assessed for any other violation of this chapter; however, should the court find in favor of the alleged violator, the bond shall refunded to the alleged violator by the municipal court clerk, and no court costs will be assessed. 
(d)  In any instance in which a alleged violator does not timely pay, within ten days of the issuance of a parking citation upon him or her, the full amount of the fine set by City Code subsection 114-3(c) for the alleged offense described in the parking citation, or properly and timely file a motion to contest along with the required bond, then the amount of the fine shall automatically increase to the amount set forth in subsection 114-3(c) as a penalty for late payment.

    Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be used; and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green alone or "go": 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Yellow alone or "caution" when shown following the green or "go" signal: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal is warned that the red or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop" signal is exhibited. 
b.  Pedestrians facing such signal are advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.

b.  A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may cautiously make a right turn; but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection. 
c.  A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street; but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection. 
d.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(4)  Red with green arrow: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
b.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(5)  If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. 
(6)  When authorized signs or markers are erected indicating any street or highway or part is newly paved or repaired or closed to traffic, no person shall drive any vehicle over any such street or highway until it is officially opened to traffic.

(a)  The driver of a vehicle, having brought it to a stop in compliance with the directive of an official traffic control signal, and having waited continuously in the same stopped position for not less than five minutes without such signal having changed from "stop," may then assume that the signal is not in proper working order and, upon visually ascertaining that he can do so with safety, may then proceed with caution, and at his own risk, to drive his vehicle beyond the signal and resume a normal and lawful speed. 
(b)  It is the purpose of this section to provide relief to vehicle drivers in those exceptional instances of failure of electrical or mechanical signals to function properly, and the burden of proof shall be upon each driver who avails himself of the right to proceed against a "stop" signal to show that he has complied with all requirements of subsection (a) of this section.

(1)  Rules and regulations. 
a.  Rules and regulations for the government of sewerage utilities adopted by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and now in effect, and all amendments thereto, and modifications thereof hereafter made by said commission. 
b.  For all premises and locations having a private water supply (that is, a well, cistern, or other water source not provided and metered by a public or private water utility) and connected to the sewer system and works, and for all premises and locations otherwise connected to the sewer system and works (such as a sanitary board approved RV dump, or other domestic (non-industrial and non-commercial) sewerage collection facility), the minimum charge will be billed each month until such time as a metering method of the discharge from said premises or location is established. 
c.  If for any reason there be no record of the amount of water supplied to a metered premises any month, the minimum charge shall be billed for that month. 
d.  The water utility may adjust usage for reasons including hidden leaks, over-read meters, and public relations. Upon a customer-of-record's request for an adjustment, the sanitary board will review the monthly meter information from the water utility and recommend an adjustment, if necessary. In cases where the meter information cannot be used, the customer-of-record's monthly use will be estimated from the average of the previous six-month period. The sanitary board does not make public relations adjustments. 
e.  Users, the nature and character of whose use is such that the amount of water discharged into the sewer system is deemed by the sanitary board to be substantially less or more than the amount of metered water supplied the premises, may be charged for sewer service substantially on the basis of the amount of water discharged into the sewer system, as may be determined according to method(s) approved by the sanitary board. 
f.  The sanitary board does not make adjustments for water that is not returned to the sewer system, including water used for swimming pools, lawn watering, cooling towers, and coin laundries. The sanitary board does not allow deduct meters to be installed on the water line. A customer may install and maintain a separate water meter at his expense for water used but not returned to the sewer system. 
g.  sanitary board customers are not billed for the first 60 days of construction to allow a builder a grace period in order to connect a new facility to the sewer system. The 60-day period may be extended for good cause shown at the sole discretion of the sanitary board's General Manager. 
h.  Final approval of any adjustment is made by the sanitary board's finance manager. Adjustments in excess of $25.00 are paid within thirty (30) days. Adjustments under $25.00 are credited to the customer's account, unless the account is terminated. 
i.  In apartment buildings, mobile home courts, shopping centers and other places where more than one occupancy unit is served with water through one water meter, the customer shall be required to pay (1) the minimum monthly charge for each occupancy unit, or (2) actual metered water usage, whichever is greater. 
(2)  Rates. 
a.  For sewage that does not contain industrial waste: 
In excess of 2,000 gallons used per month, per thousand gallons ..... $14.26 
b.  For sewage that contains industrial waste: 
1.  Where the character of sewage from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes a burden upon the sewer system in addition to the burden imposed by domestic sewage entering the sewer system, the sanitary board may compel the owner, tenant or occupant of such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to treat such sewage in such manner as shall be specified by the sanitary board before discharging into the sewer system. In the absence of such treatment sufficient to remove such additional burden, the charges for treatment of such sewage shall be as follows: 
Monthly service charge ..... $10,000.00 
Volumetric treatment charge, per thousand gallons ..... $6.50 
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) charge, per pound ..... $0.65 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) charge, per pound ..... $0.50 
2.  When an industrial user is to be served, a preliminary study of its waste, and the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing materials which, in the judgment of the sanitary board, should not be introduced into the sewer system, need not be handled by it. The results of this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service. 
(3)  Minimum charge. No bill will be rendered for less than $26.06 for each month or fraction thereof, for usage of 2,000 gallons or less. 
(4)  Recovery of bank charges. If a bank or other financial institution returns a customer's check to the sanitary board and charges a fee to the sanitary board for such service, the fee charged will be added to the account of the customer whose check is returned. 
(5)  Pretreatment charge. In addition to all other charges contained herein, all customers who operate under a pretreatment permit will pay an annual charge of $2,500.00, payable on July 1 of each year. 
(6)  Disconnect, lien, and reconnect fees. If the sanitary board gives notice to a provider of water service to disconnect water service to a customer of the sanitary board, the following charges will be added to the account of such customer: 
a.  A charge equal to that imposed upon the sanitary board by the water service provider, plus any legally required certified mail charge, will be added to such customer's account at the time notice to disconnect is given to the water provider. 
b.  A charge equal to the filing fee to cover the cost of placing a lien on the property served will be added to the account of such customer at the time such lien is filed in the office of the clerk of the county commission of the county where the property served is located. 
c.  A reconnect charge equal to that imposed upon the sanitary board by the water service provider will be made at the time the customer pays the amounts due on such customer's account and requests the reconnection of water and sewer service. 
(7)  New service fee. A new service fee equal to the greater of $250.00 or the sanitary board's actual cost of making the connection shall be paid before sewer service can be obtained at any location not previously connected to the sanitary board's collection system. 
(8)  Delayed payment penalty. On all current usage billings not paid in full by the latest pay date, which shall be no sooner than the 20th day following the date the sanitary board mails the bill, ten percent will be added to the net current amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.

g.  To correct typographical or other errors in the industrial user discharge permit; or 
h.  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator where requested in accordance with section 118-208(f). 
(f)  Industrial user discharge permit transfer. 
(1)  Industrial user discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 calendar days advance notice to the board and the board approves the industrial user discharge permit transfer. The notice to the board must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
a.  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
b.  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
c.  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing industrial user discharge permit. 
(2)  Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the industrial user discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(g)  Industrial user discharge permit revocation . The board may revoke an industrial user discharge permit for including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to notify the board of significant changes to the wastewater discharge prior to the changed discharge;

(h)  Permit reissuance. The user shall apply for permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. 
(i)  Continuation of expired permits. An expired permit will continue to be effective and enforceable until the permit is reissued if: 
(1)  The industrial user has submitted a complete permit application at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the user's existing permit. 
(2)  The failure to reissue the permit, prior to expiration of the previous permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the industrial user. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-209. - Monitoring and reporting requirement. 
(a)  Discharge reports . 
(1)  Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge report at such intervals as are designated by the general manager. The general manager may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing to discharge into the POTW to file such periodic reports. 
a.  Discharge report format shall be pre-approved by board and is subject to change by the board. Two paper copies and one electronic copy (in board approved format) are required to be submitted by the industrial user. 
(2)  The discharge report shall include but shall not be limited to nature of process, volume, rates of flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation, concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the general manager may require information in the form of industrial user discharge permit applications and self-monitoring reports. 
a.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a bmp or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the board or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the industrial user. 
(3)  The discharge report shall be accompanied by the certification statement set forth in section 118-207(c). The certification statement shall be signed by the appropriate individual as described in section 118-207(c). 
(b)  Records and monitoring . 
(1)  All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewater into the POTW shall maintain such records of production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts of concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this article and any applicable state or federal pretreatment standards or requirements, and any BMPs based on any categorical standards. Such records shall be available to the public without restriction. Any request for confidential treatment of information and for access to such information shall be governed by procedures specified in 40 CFR 2. 
(2)  Such records shall be made available upon request by the general manager. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA and the WVDEP upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial user's compliance with this division shall be prepared and submitted quarterly to the board. 
(3)  The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging industrial wastewater into the POTW shall install at her/his own cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall: 
a.  Be pre-approved by the board. 
b.  Be located where approved by the board. 
c.  Be maintained by the industrial user in proper working order and kept secure, but accessible to the board at all times. 
d.  Be calibrated and certified by a manufacturer's authorized third party to the user and board, on a routine basis, as determined by the manufacturer's guidelines or at least once per year, whichever frequency is less. The industrial user will observe the calibration and shall receive a copy of the calibration/certification report. 
(4)  The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the industrial user, the board may allow the equipment to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(5)  When more than one industrial user can discharge into a common sewer the board may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each industrial user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single industrial user, the board may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
(6)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the board's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. 
(c)  Inspection, sampling and analysis. 
(1)  Compliance determination . Compliance determinations with respect to section 118-203 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater, as determined by the general manager. 
a.  Except as indicated in subsections b and c below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite is authorized by the board. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the board, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the board, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
c.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the board may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 118-209(a) or 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. Failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(2)  Analysis of industrial wastewaters . Monitoring of pollutants and laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 136. Analysis of those pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the general manager of the board and the WVDEP . 
(3)  Sampling frequency . Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance determination with respect to section 118-203 will be done at such intervals as the board may designate. However, it is the intention of the board to conduct compliance sampling or to cause such sampling to be conducted for all major contributing industries at least once every year. 
(d)  Reports of changed conditions . Each user must notify the board of any significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90-calendar days before the change. 
(1)  The board may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of an industrial user discharge permit application under section 118-207. 
(2)  The board may issue an industrial user discharge permit under section 118-207 of this division or modify an existing industrial user discharge permit under section 118-208(e) of this division in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(e)  Reports of potential problems . 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify the board of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(2)  Within five calendar days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the board, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(f)  Reports of unpermitted users . All industrial users not required to obtain an industrial user discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the board as the board may require. 
(g)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting . If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the board within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the board within 30 calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(h)  Date of receipt of reports . Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the board's date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(i)  Record/keeping . Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the industrial user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs. Records shall include the date, exact place, methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the industrial user or the board, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the board. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-210. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry inspection and sampling . The board shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any industrial user discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the board ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the board shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The board shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The board may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the board and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the board access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(b)  Search warrants . If the board has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the board designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the board may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate Kanawha County Court. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-211. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, industrial user discharge permit applications, industrial user discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the board's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests confidential treatment of the information and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret process shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the user furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-212. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
(a)  The board shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper of the city, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs (3), (4) or (8) of this section) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all the measurements taken for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit on the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of an industrial user discharge permit effluent limit or of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 118-201 that the general manager determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of potw personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the board's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety calendar days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an industrial user discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 calendar days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the board determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-213. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation . When the board finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the board may serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Within 30 calendar days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the person to the board. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the board to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Cease and desist orders. When the general manager finds that a person has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, an industrial user discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that such person's past violations are likely to recur, the general manager may issue an order to the person directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing such person to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against such person. 
(c)  Consent orders. The general manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by such person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (b) and (d)(4) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(d)  Show cause hearing. 
(1)  The board may order a person that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the board and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and requesting that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the person. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person. 
(2)  The board may conduct the hearing and receive the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the board: 
a.  Issue in the name of the board notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in any such hearings; 
b.  Receive the evidence; and/or 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the board for action. 
(3)  At any public hearing, testimony taken before the board or any person designated by it must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges. 
(4)  After the board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the party responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, or compliance schedule, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated, and such further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate. 
(5)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the person to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, beginning operation, and conducting routine operation). No increment shall exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18 months. 
(6)  No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the person shall submit a progress report to the general manager, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the person to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the general manager. 
(e)  Compliance orders . When the board finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued pursuant to this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the board may issue an order to the person responsible for the discharge directing that the person come into compliance within a specified time. If the person does not come into compliance within the time provided, the ability to discharge to the POTW may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person. 
(f)  Legal action. If any person violates a provision of this article, any order of the board, or any term or condition of a permit issued under section 118-208, the board attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in Kanawha County Circuit Court. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions . The board may immediately suspend a person's discharge, after informal notice to the person, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The board may also immediately suspend a person's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge. In the event of a person's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the board may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any persons. The board may allow the person to recommence its discharge when the person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 118-213(h) of this division are initiated against the person. 
(2)  A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the board prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 118-213(d) or (h) of this division. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge . In addition to the provisions in this division, any person who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of industrial user discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the person's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in this division. 
Such person will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 118-213(d) of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the board shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-214. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the board finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision(s) of this division, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the board may petition the Kanawha County Circuit Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains the violating activity or compels the specific performance of the industrial user discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the person. The board may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the person to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a person. 
(b)  Civil penalties . 
(1)  A person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the board for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000.00 but not less than $1,000.00. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The board may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the board. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the person's violation, corrective actions by the person, the compliance history of the person, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a person. 
(c)  Remedies nonexclusive . The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The board may take other action against any person when the circumstances warrant. Further, the board is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant person. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-215. - Supplemental enforcement authority. 
(a)  Financial assurance . The general manager may decline to issue or reissue an industrial user discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. The basis for such denial shall be reevaluated upon proof to the general manager that the user has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(b)  Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The general manager may decline to issue or reissue an industrial user discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines, or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this article, a previous industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder. 
(c)  Water supply severance . Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, an industrial user discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be discontinued. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 7596, 9-16-2013) 
Sec. 118-216. - Criminal penalty. 
    Any person who willfully or negligently violates a provision of this article, any order of the board, or any term or condition of a permit issued under section 118-208; willfully or negligently fails to notify the board of unauthorized discharges; falsifies the discharge records kept under the requirements of section 118-209; or alters monitoring equipment required by section 118-209 in order to facilitate false observation, sampling or measurement of wastewater shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not less than $100.00, nor more than $1000.00 or imprisoned in the county jail for a period not to exceed six months, or both such fine and imprisonment. Any person who intentionally misrepresents any material fact in an application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained under the provisions of this article is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1000.00 nor more than $10,000 or by imprisonment in jail not exceeding six months, or by both fine and imprisonment.

Sec. 118-217. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset . 
(1)  For the purpose of this division, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with an applicable discharge standard or requirement because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable discharge standards or requirements if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the board within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five calendar days. 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  The user shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable discharge standards or requirements. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable discharge standards or requirements upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards . A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 118-203(a) of this division or the specific prohibitions in sections 118-203(b)(1) through (18) of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the board was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. For the purpose of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(3)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. 
(4)  Bypass notifications. 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit a prior notice to the board, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the board of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds an applicable pretreatment standard within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided to the board within five calendar days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The board may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four hours. 
(5)  Bypass is prohibited, and the board may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (4) of this subsection. 
The board may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the board determines that the user will meet one or more of the three conditions listed in paragraph (5) a of this subsection.

Rule No. 8. - Reference of bills, resolutions, etc., to committees. 
    No bill, resolution, petition, communication or report may be divided among two or more committees although it contains subjects properly within the jurisdiction of several committees but must be referred to one committee in its entirety. 
    When the presiding officer is of the opinion that a bill, resolution, petition, communication or report should be considered by more than one committee, at the time of referring it the presiding officer may direct that when the committee to which it is referred completes its consideration thereof and makes a recommendation with respect thereto, such bill, resolution, petition, communication or report shall be automatically referred to such other committee as directed by the presiding officer upon making the initial referral. 
    This provision shall not be construed as limiting the right of any member of the city council to move, or the presiding officer to order, the reference of any bill, resolution, petition, communication or report to another committee upon receipt of the report of the committee to which initially referred, or to recommit to the committee to which initially referred. 
Rule No. 9. - Requests for action; making entries in the journal.

    A member of the city council may move to reconsider the vote on any question during the meeting at which such question was voted upon or at the next regular meeting of council if the member voted on the prevailing side or, irrespective of how the member voted, if there was not a roll call vote.

(2)  Motion to table. 
(3)  Motion for the previous question. 
(4)  Motion to recess. 
Rule No. 12. - Rules of debate. 
    No question shall be debated until it has been propounded by the chair, and then the mover shall have the right to explain his or her view in preference to any other member and shall have the right to close the debate. 
    When two or more members of the city council arise at the same time, the presiding officer shall name the person to speak; but in all cases, the member who shall first rise and address the chair shall speak first. 
    No one shall disturb or interrupt a member who is speaking, without the member's permission, except to call to order if the member is transgressing the rules. 
Rule No. 13. - Call for a division of a question. 
    Any member of the city council may call for a division of any question before a vote is taken thereon if it comprehends propositions in substance so distinct that, if one proposition be taken away, another substantive proposition remains for decision by the city council; but a member of the city council calling for a division of a question shall state in what manner the question shall be divided. 
Rule No. 14. - Use of a previous roll call. 
    On any question, the roll call immediately next preceding may be used to record the vote of the city council upon motion by any member, provided such previous roll call was unanimous. 
Rule No. 15. - When a member abstains from voting. 
    No member shall vote on any question before the city council if the member is directly and immediately interested therein other than as a citizen of the City of Charleston; however, no member may abstain from voting without, prior to a vote being taken, having stated the reason for not voting and having obtained a ruling from the presiding officer excusing the member from voting. 
Rule No. 16. - Decisions on questions of order. 
    The presiding officer shall decide all questions of order, subject to an appeal to the city council which shall be determined by a majority vote of those present and voting. 
Rule No. 17. - Presiding officer may relinquish chair. 
    The presiding officer of the city council may call any member of the city council to the chair, who shall exercise its functions for the time being. 
Rule No. 18. - Demand of previous question. 
    If the previous question be demanded by not less than three members, the presiding officer shall, without debate, put the question: "Shall the main question be now put?" If this question be decided in the affirmative, all further debate shall cease and the vote be at once taken on the proposition pending before the city council. When the council refuses to order the main question, the consideration of the subject shall be resumed as if the previous question had not been demanded. 
Rule No. 19. - Rescission, amendment and suspension of rules. 
(a)  No standing order or rule of the city council shall be rescinded or amended except by a majority vote of the members elected to the city council. 
(b)  No rule of the city council shall be suspended in any case except by unanimous consent of the councilmembers present, provided, that no rule shall be suspended if compliance therewith is made mandatory by state law, the city Charter or an ordinance of the City of Charleston. 
Rule No. 20. - Calling for a division of city council. 
    The presiding officer may in case of doubt and shall upon the request of any member call for a division of the city council on any vote by requiring first those voting in the affirmative to stand and then those voting in the negative to stand. 
Rule No. 21. - Parliamentary rules of order. 
    The rules of parliamentary usage comprised in the manual known as "Manual of Legislative Procedure" by Paul Mason shall govern the city council in all cases not provided for by the rules of city council, city Charter and state law. In any case not governed by said manual, said rules, city Charter or state law, the city council shall be governed by the practice in the House of Delegates of the State of West Virginia. 
    A copy of said manual shall remain on file in the office of the clerk of the city council. 
Rule No. 22. - Members of the public speaking before city council. 
(a)  A member of council may ask the floor for a member of the public to speak before council, which said motion is nondebatable. Upon such request, the presiding officer shall inquire of the councilmember the subject matter of the inquiry and ask council if there is any objection to the person speaking, and, if an objection is raised, then council, by majority vote, shall determine whether or not the person shall be allowed to address council. Any person addressing council shall be allowed no more than five minutes to make remarks, unless by unanimous consent council allows a longer period of time. 
(b)  A maximum of ten minutes shall be set aside at the outset of each meeting of the council to permit members of the public, without leave of council, to address the council on any matter pertaining to the city's business. Any member of the public wishing to address the council shall first register with the clerk of the city council, or the clerk's designated representative for such purpose, in the council's chambers not earlier than 15 minutes before the beginning of each meeting setting forth his or her name, the group, if any, on whose behalf he or she wishes to speak, and the subject matter which he or she wishes to address. If more than one person registers to address council, such persons shall be allocated time on a prorated basis, and shall be permitted to speak only for the time allotted. In no event shall more than five people be permitted to address the council under this rule 22(b). Nothing in this rule 22(b) shall affect the ability of a member of council to request that a member of the public be allowed to speak pursuant to rule 22(a).

D. 	Bring about the gradual conformity of the uses of land and buildings with the zoning regulations set forth, and minimize conflicts among the uses of land and buildings; 
E.

Sec.  14-010 Purpose 
The Central Business District (CBD) is established to provide for the economic vitality and orderly growth of the City. This district is intended to be a compact, densely developed and well-defined area having a strong pedestrian orientation and urban character that is compatible without surrounding neighborhoods.  The standards of this district are established to provide for a vital downtown economy that maintains Charleston's focus as a political, commercial, cultural and entertainment hub of the region while increasing livability and compatibility with the Urban Renewal Overlay district found in portions of downtown Charleston. The Central Business District (CBD) is of special public interest for the following reasons: 
A. 	Recognition of the function of this district and its orientation to the interstate highway system, and in view of the limited amount of available developable flat land within the City, this area has potential for high intensity development in a compatible arrangement of government, commercial, office, residential, and service uses in a unique setting. 
B. 	The permitted uses and regulations of the district are intended to promote an attractive pedestrian environment with retail, personal service, and office establishments at street level and with minimal disruption from vehicle-oriented land uses and features that would detract from a pedestrian environment. 
C. 	This district is an integral part of the center of economic, social, and civic life in the community. Therefore, it requires sensitive regulations to maintain and enhance the relationships between height, bulk, light, air, and amenities and habitation of the area. 
D. 	This district is intended to promote the preservation of historic and architectural character and the predominant scale of the CBD by encouraging retention and appropriate use of existing structures and to ensure that new infill development be compatible with surrounding structures and the area in general. 
E. 	This district should be regulated in a manner, which aids in ensuring its ties with retail development in the adjacent Urban Renewal area, as well as solidifying its position as an important and contributing sector of the downtown area. 
Sec. 14-020 Lot Provisions 
A.	Non-residential uses 
1. 	No minimum lot size shall be required  
2. 	No minimum lot frontage shall be required.

2. 	The minimum lot frontage shall be 40 feet. The frontage requirement may be waived for a parcel not fronting on an existing road if the parcel is served by a proper right-of-way. 
3. 	Maximum lot coverage shall be 100 percent. 
Sec.  14-030 Setbacks 
A. 	Non-residential uses: 
1.	In all cases, the front setback for all new construction shall be the same as existing 	buildings on the same block.   
B. 	Multi-family residential uses: 
1. 	Front setback:  	0 feet 
2. 	Side setback:  	0 feet 
3.	Rear setback:  	0 feet 
4. 	In all cases, the front setback for all new construction shall be the same as existing buildings on the same block. 
C. 	For all uses, the front yard setback will conform to the clearly prevailing setback pattern of developed lots within the block fronting the same street.  When an unimproved lot is situated between tow lots with existing principal buildings that each have front yard setbacks less than the setback required in that district, then the front yard setback may be reduced to a depth equal to the average of the two adjacent lots, provided that in no case shall a front yard be reduced by more than 50 percent of the required front yard for that district. 
Sec.  14-040 Building Height 
A. 	The maximum height permitted for all principal structures shall be 400 feet.  The provisions of Article 22-020, Height Exceptions, shall not apply.  Height shall reflect character and the development concept for an area or street corridor.

Sec.  15-010 Purpose 
The Urban Corridor District (UCD) is established to provide for the economic vitality and orderly growth of the City. A desirable quality of life for residents results from the physical form, design and pattern of development in the traditional Main Street format.  This district is characterized by an inviting and attractive street environment that encourages pedestrian activity and informal interaction among residents, merchants and visitors. This interaction is enlivened by the closely interwoven combination of residential, retail, service, office and other non-residential uses built at a human scale and are intended to be compact, densely developed and well-defined areas of  urban character that are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.  The standards of this district are established to provide for additional regulations to protect the distinctive character, landscape, and historic nature of structures and design within the UCD in accordance with the goals set forth by the Charleston Historic Landmarks Commission and with the City of Charleston Comprehensive Plan. The Urban Corridor District (UCD) is of special public interest for the following reasons: 
A. 	The district is established to protect and enhance the overall quality of the built environment and some of the design standards apply to activities that occur in public areas such as streets and sidewalks, public parking areas and public parks and are intended to guide City Officials as well as private citizens in making land use and land management decisions.
B. 	The permitted uses and regulations of the district are intended to promote an attractive pedestrian environment with retail, personal service, and office establishments at street level as well as residential uses in upper floors and to promote the uses that will attract well-planned mixed use developments with minimal disruption from vehicle-oriented land uses and features that would detract from a pedestrian environment. 
C. 	This district is an integral part of the center of economic, social, and civic life in the community. Therefore, it requires sensitive regulations to maintain and enhance the relationships between height, bulk, light, air, and amenities and habitation of the area. The economic and social viability of the City of Charleston depends on maintaining and enhancing the attractiveness of the street environment, the economic viability of the businesses in the district, and a welcoming atmosphere for residential occupants and visitors.
D. 	This district is intended to promote the preservation of historic and architectural character and the predominant scale of the UCD by encouraging retention and appropriate use of existing structures and to ensure that new infill development is compatible with surrounding structures and the area in general. 
E. 	This district should be regulated in a manner, which aids in ensuring its ties with retail development in adjacent Urban Renewal areas.  Gateway and transition areas contribute to the character of the district and are appropriately subject to specific design standards that will protect and enhance their unique character as well as solidifying its position as an important and contributing sector of the city.

Sec.  20-010 Purpose 
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development district is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design of land developments than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. Planned Unit Developments are intended to allow substantial flexibility in planning to promote more economical and efficient use of land.  Ideally, this flexibility results in a development that is better planned, contains more amenities, and is a more desirable to live in than one produced in accordance with typical zoning ordinance and subdivision controls. An intrinsic premise upon which the approval of a Planned Unit Development must be conditioned is that while greater density or more lenient siting requirements may be granted, the Planned Unit Development should contain features not normally required of traditional developments.  
Through proper planning and design, each Planned Unit Development shall include features which further, and are in compliance with, the following objectives: 
A. 	To allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative, and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible through strict application of standard zoning and subdivision controls. 
B. 	To encourage land development that, to the greatest extent possible, preserves natural vegetation, respects natural topographic and geologic conditions, and refrains from adversely affective flooding, soil, drainage, and other natural ecologic conditions. 
C. 	To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and structural/visual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of different land uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner. 
D. 	To provide for abundant, accessible, and properly located open and recreation space. 
E. 	To promote the efficient use of land resulting in networks of utilities, streets and other infrastructure features that maximize the allocation of fiscal and natural resources. 
F. 	To enable land developments to be completely compatible and congruous with adjacent and nearby land developments. 
G. 	To ensure that development occurs at proper locations, away from environmentally sensitive areas and on land physically suited to construction. 
H. 	To allow unique and unusual land uses to be planned for and located in a manner that ensures harmony with the surrounding community. 
I. 	To create a method for the permanent preservation of historic buildings and/or landmarks, where appropriate. 
Sec.  20-020 General Requirements 
A. 	Each phase or section of a multi-phase PUD shall meet open space and density requirements on an independent basis.  At no point during the development of a multi-phase project shall the density of residential development in any phase of the PUD exceed the maximum density for the total land area included in that phase. 
B. 	All engineering requirements shall be certified by a professional engineer licensed by the State of West Virginia. 
C. 	All architectural requirements shall be certified by a professional architect licensed by the State of West Virginia. 
D. 	The subdivision of all parcels of land shall be in conformance with the Charleston Subdivision Ordinance. 
E. 	A rezoning of the property proposed for the PUD is required.   
Sec.  20-030 Procedure for Planned Unit Development Approval 
A. 	The unique character of a Planned Unit Developments (PUD) requires a thorough application and review process.  PUDs are more complex and of a significantly different character than other projects requiring site plan review, and therefore, require the establishment of specific procedures different than those used to process most site plans. The procedures, standards, objectives and purpose set forth in this Article, when in conflict with other provisions of this Ordinance, as they may pertain to PUDs, shall be superseding.  
1. 	Pre-application Conference 
The intent of the Pre-Application Conference is to discuss with the applicant the compatibility of the proposed PUD with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the Citys PUD procedures.  At the Pre-Application Conference, the Planning Director and the City Engineer shall meet with the applicant to review a sketch plan of the proposed PUD which schematically shall illustrate proposed land uses, major structures, type and density of development, major site amenities, general street layout and configuration of all open space.  The size and complexity of the PUD shall be discussed at the conference.  The Pre-Application Conference is mandatory and must be completed prior to the submission of a Preliminary PUD Plan.  
2.	Preliminary PUD Plan Submission 
a.	It is the intent of the Preliminary PUD Plan Submission to obtain approval from the Planning Commission for the plans and design that the applicant contemplates. If the Preliminary PUD Plan is approved, the applicant is permitted to proceed to Final PUD Plan Procedure with reasonable assurance that the Final PUD Plan will be approved if substantially in compliance with the Preliminary PUD Plan.    
b. 	A request for approval of a Preliminary PUD Plan shall be submitted to the Planning Office for public hearing, review and recommendation.  The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD application.   The Planning Commission may impose additional reasonable conditions on the Preliminary PUD Plan.   
 c. 	The application to rezone a parcel to the PUD designation shall be made concurrently with the submission of the preliminary PUD plan.  The required public hearing on the rezoning application shall be held in accordance with Article 29-020 of this Ordinance.  Once approved, the PUD zoning designation shall expire two years following the original date of approval if final approval is not achieved for the PUD plan. 
 d. 	Following the public hearing and review of the Preliminary PUD Plan submission, the Planning Commission shall recommend approval, modification, or denial of the Preliminary PUD Plan, and the reasons therefore.  The Commission shall set forth written findings of fact describing how the Preliminary PUD Plan meets or does not meet the standards and objectives stated in this Article. 
3. 	Final PUD Plan Submission 
a. 	The applicant shall submit a Final PUD Plan to the Planning Office for review and approval, in accordance with the conditions set forth by the Planning Commission in their written decision.   
b. 	No building or construction may be initiated on the proposed PUD site, and no permits may be issued, until the Final PUD Plan has been submitted, approved, and recorded. Approval of a Preliminary PUD Plan shall not constitute approval of the Final PUD Plan; rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the Preliminary PUD Plan and as a guide to the preparation of the Final PUD Plan, which will be submitted for approval by the Planning Commission and subsequent recording, upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and conditions of the preliminary approval, if any.  
Sec.  20-040 Planned Unit Development Application Requirements 
A. 	A Preliminary PUD Plan submission shall be provided in the form of a drawing of the proposed PUD site prepared at a scale of not less than 1 inch = 50 feet, or as considered appropriate by the Planning Director, and shall show location, proposed uses and dimensions of buildings, structures, and parking areas; open space areas, recreation facilities, and other details to indicate the character of the proposed development. Specifically, the submission shall include: 
1. 	The location of the site in relation to the surrounding neighborhood and identification of adjacent zoning districts. 
2. 	Map data such as north point, scale and date of preparation. 
3. 	The name of the proposed development, with the words Preliminary Plan" in the title block. Property lines of the overall tract with all bearings and distances. 
4. 	Calculation of the total area of the site.  
5. 	Proposed circulation system, including general access, roadways, driveways, curb cuts, parking areas, bikeways and walkways. 
6. 	Proposed division of property by general land use category with approximate dimensions of each land use type. 
7.	Total number of residential units proposed. 
8. 	Calculation of the area of land per dwelling unit. 
9. 	Type and total square footage of all non-residential land uses. 
10. 	General area, location, setbacks and height of all existing and proposed structures. 
11. 	Location of all watercourses, wetlands and the 100-year floodplain. 
12. 	Facilities plan for water, sanitary sewer, public utilities. 
13. 	Open space and recreation plan showing approximate area, location and configuration. 
14. 	Any additional documentation which the Planning Director determines to be necessary in order to perform a complete and thorough review of the plan in accordance with this section of this ordinance. 
15. 	Scheduling plan indicating the stages in which the project will be built, including the area, density, use, and open space to be developed with each stage. Each stage shall be described and mapped and projected dates provided for beginning and completion of each stage of land development.  
16. 	Agreements and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and continued protection of the PUD and its common spaces, shared facilities, and private roads. 
17. 	Guarantee of Performance for Completion of Improvements. A bond or other guarantee acceptable to the City shall be provided for all proposed public improvements and shall be executed at time of permit application or platting, whichever comes first. Improvements that must be guaranteed include facilities that shall become public, and may include other facilities or improvements as may be specified in the Preliminary or Final PUD Plan approval. If the project is to be built in phases, the guarantee shall be posted prior to the commencement of work on each phase. The guarantee shall specify the time for completion of improvements, and shall be in an amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of a verifiable estimated cost of the improvements, as determined by the project contractor or engineer, and as approved by the City Engineer. 
B. 	Planning Commission Public Hearing 
After a complete review by planning staff, the Planned Unit Development proposal shall be presented to the Planning Commission for a public hearing.  The Planning Commission may impose additional reasonable conditions with the approval of the PUD.  Should the Planning Commission approve the Preliminary PUD Plan, preliminary subdivision approval shall be granted concurrently.  Approval of the Planned Unit Development shall be final. 
Sec.  20-050 Permitted Uses

(e) 	Level or below ground improvements such as swimming pools, tennis courts, walking trails, etc., shall not occupy more than twenty (20) percent of the common open space. 
Sec.  20-070 Criteria for Review 
In consideration of a Preliminary PUD Plan, the following criteria shall be used: 
A.	General conformance with the zoning ordinance:  The extent to which the Planned Unit Development meets the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and any other adopted planning objectives of the City. 
B. 	The proposal will not be injurious to the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
C. 	The physical design of the Planned Unit Development and the extent to which it makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate control over vehicular traffic and promotes alternative forms of transportation, provides for and protects designated permanent open space, and furthers the amenities of urban ambience, light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment. 
D. 	The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the adjacent properties and neighborhood, and whether the proposed plan would substantially interfere with the use or diminish the value of adjacent properties and neighborhoods. 
E. 	The desirability of the proposed plan to the City's physical development, tax base and economic well-being. At the discretion of the Planning Commission and City Council, special consideration in the form of increased development flexibility may be given to projects that are intended to rehabilitate or replace dilapidated areas, brownfields, or other areas of general visual or economic blight. Such special consideration shall not be granted to projects intended for construction on lands that consist of sixty (60) percent or more previously undeveloped lands. 
F. 	The proposal will not cause undue traffic congestion, and can be adequately served by existing or programmed public facilities and services. 
G. 	The proposal preserves significant ecological, natural, historical, and architectural resources to the extent possible. 
H. 	The proposal will enhance the appearance, image, function, and economic sustainability of the community at large. 
I. 	Projects which are designed to a more human scale, support multi-modal transportation options, preserve useful open space, provide significant amenities to residents, and incorporate architectural detailing, massing and scale that is consistent with historical community norms shall have a significant advantage in the review process over those that merely seek to maximize inappropriate forms of density, circumvent customary development standards, or promote a pattern of development that can be generally recognized as urban sprawl, as defined in this ordinance. 
J. 	The proposal makes reasonable accommodations in housing, recreational amenities, and pedestrian facilities for individuals with disabilities. 
K. 	The proposal dedicates and provides a percentage of the total number of dwelling units to be offered at sale or rental prices deemed affordable to individuals of low and moderate income, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Generally, between three (3) to five (5) percent of all units should meet this goal. 
Sec.  20-080 Changes in the Approved Planned Unit Development 
A. 	Changes in the Preliminary PUD Plan which alter the concept or intent of the Planned Unit Development and would require new approval include but are not limited to: 
1. 	Significant increases in density; 
2. 	Significant changes in the proportion or allocation of land uses; 
3. 	Change in the list of approved uses; 
4. 	Changes in the locations of uses; 
5. 	Changes in functional uses of open space, where such change constitutes an intensification of use of the open space; and/or 
6. 	Changes in the final governing agreements where such changes conflict with the approved Preliminary PUD Plan.  
B. 	Changes in the Final PUD Plan which alter the concept or intent of the Planned Unit Development and would require new approval include but are not limited to: 
1. 	Changes in lot arrangement, or addition of buildable lots that change the approved density of the development; 
2. 	Changes in site design requirements, such as location of required landscaping, signage, building height, architectural character, cube and/or footprint, or other such requirements of the Zoning Ordinance; 
3. 	Changes to the internal street system or off-street parking areas; 
4. 	Changes in drainage management structures; 
5. 	Changes in Access to the development site, where such change amounts to an intensification in the traffic patterns of roadways of classification higher than local; and/or 
6. 	All other changes not expressly addressed in this section shall require new Final Plan approval. 
Section 20-090 Revocation and Extension 
A Planned Unit Development conditional use shall become null and void and the subject property shall thereupon be rezoned to its most appropriate district classification, as deemed suitable by City Council acting upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission, in any case where the PUD has:  
A. 	Received Preliminary PUD Plan approval and where the Preliminary Plat of said PUD, or the first phase of the Preliminary Plat if construction is to take place in phases, has not been submitted for approval within two (2) years after the date of approval of the Preliminary PUD Plan.
B. 	Received Preliminary PUD Plan approval and where the Final PUD Plan, or the first phase of the Final PUD Plan if construction is to take place in phases, has not been submitted for approval within one (1) year after the date of approval of the Preliminary PUD Plan.  
C. 	Received Final PUD Plan approval and where the construction of the PUD, as authorized by the issuance of a building permit, has not begun within (1) year after the date of approval of the Final PUD Plan dealing with such construction. 
D. 	Further, if construction of a PUD falls more than two (2) years behind the building schedule filed with the Final PUD Plan, City Council, acting upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall either extend the project schedule or initiate action to revoke the PUD conditional use. In doing so, one (1) year extensions in the building schedule filed with the Final PUD Plan may be granted by City Council, acting upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission. If Council so stipulates when acting favorably on a PUD, the Planning Commission may be delegated the authority of granting such one (1) year extensions in the building schedule of the PUD.

OVERLAY DISTRICTS
Contents

Sec.  21-010 	Purpose 
Sec.  21-020 	Establishment and Designation 
Sec.  21-030 	Urban Renewal (UR) Overlay District 
Sec.  21-040 	Historic (HD) Overlay District 
Sec.  21-050 	Neighborhood Conservation (NC) Overlay District 

Sec.  21-010 Purpose 
The purpose of overlay zoning districts is to allow the City to establish special land use regulations, standards, or procedures in areas with unique land use, site planning, building design, or environmental resource issues.  Overlay zoning districts are also an appropriate mechanism to implement long-term goals and land use requirements of the City for a specific property, location, or to coordinate land use and design requirements unique to a large tract of land.  Overlay zoning districts are intended to be applied only where special circumstances justify the modification of base zoning district regulations to achieve specific land use and design objectives. 
 In addition to the conventional zoning districts established by this ordinance, the following overlay districts are established: 
A.	Urban Renewal Overlay (UR) 
B. 	Historic District Overlay (HD) 
C. 	Neighborhood Conservation Overlay (NC)
D. 	Neighborhood Reinvestment Overlay District (NRO)

Sec.  21-020 Establishment and Designation  
Overlay zoning districts are established through rezoning, and only in conjunction with base zoning districts.  Letters, numbers, or a combination thereof, shall be combined with other applicable district designations to the property or properties on which an overlay district is established.  Except as modified by the overlay zoning district, the provisions of the applicable base zoning district shall apply to all development within the boundary of the designated area. If regulations conflict, the applicable overlay zoning district regulations shall prevail.  
Whenever an overlay district is established, any subsequent application to change the base zoning district shall not be construed to be an application to eliminate the overlay district for the property covered by the application.  An intent to eliminate the overlay district on a given property shall be expressly stated to be part of the application.  
Sec.  21-030 Urban Renewal Overlay District (UR) 
Sec.  21-030-01 Purpose 
The intent of the Urban Renewal Overlay District is to facilitate the redevelopment and reinvestment within approved Urban Renewal Districts in the City.  This overlay district specifies exceptions and Additions to the land use regulations of the base zoning district.  Developments within the overlay district must conform to the requirements of both the base zoning district and the overlay district or the more restrictive of the two. The boundaries of all approved Urban Renewal districts have been defined by City Council ordinance. 
Sec.  21-030-02 Power to Designate Districts 
A. 	The Urban Renewal Authority has the authority to designate Urban Renewal Districts pursuant to the Code of West Virginia, Chapter 16, Article 18, as amended.  City Council shall approve all proposed Urban Renewal Districts. 
B. 	Redevelopment plans prepared by the Urban Renewal Authority, reviewed by the Planning Commission and adopted by City Council identify the boundaries of geographically delineated areas within the City, which have been identified as areas of slum and blight.  To mitigate these conditions, the Urban Renewal Authority redevelopment plans contain specific provisions for land use, development standards, façade restoration, demolition and other redevelopment-related activities to foster new public and private capital investment.
Sec. 21-030-03 Permitted Uses 
A. 	Property and buildings in the Urban Renewal District may be used for the purpose permitted by the base zoning district legislatively approved for the district by City Council.  Furthermore, additional uses may be permitted by the Urban Renewal redevelopment plan for each Urban Renewal District approved by City Council pursuant to the Code of West Virginia, Chapter 16, Article 18, as amended. 
B.  	When an Urban Renewal District expires, the properties included within the expired districts boundaries shall continue to be permitted and limited in accordance with the expired redevelopment plan until such time as City Council rezones the properties in accordance with Article 29 of this ordinance.   
C. 	The list of uses permitted in each Urban Renewal Overlay District can be found in the respective Urban Renewal District Redevelopment Plan available from the Planning Office and the Charleston Urban Renewal Authority. 
Sec.  21-030-04 Lot Provisions 
The lot development standards required for each Urban Renewal Overlay District can be found in the respective Urban Renewal District Redevelopment Plan available from the Planning Office and the Charleston Urban Renewal Authority. 
 
Sec.  21-040 Historic District Overlay (HD) 
Sec.  21-040-01 Purpose 
It is the purpose of the Historic District Overlay to achieve the preservation of selected historic buildings, structures and sites throughout the City of Charleston by providing additional safeguards and land use regulations in addition to the requirements of the base zoning district and the design review powers of the Charleston Historic Landmarks Commission in order to: 1) protect the heritage of the historic site(s) by preserving the cultural, social, economic, political, architectural or archaeological history; 2) foster urban and civic beauty; 3) promote the preservation, and where permitted and appropriate, the use of historic districts for the education, welfare, and pleasure of the residents of the City and the region; and 4) strengthen the local economy.
Sec.  21-040-02 Power to Designate Districts 
For the purposes of this section, City Council may establish, change, layout, and define historic districts which are of local, state or national historic or architectural significance following the procedures set forth in this ordinance for the reclassification of zoning. Such Historic Districts may include structures, archaeological sites, lots, tracts of land, as well as portions thereof.    
Sec.  21-040-03 Conflict 
The historic district and property regulations provided in this section are intended to identify, study, preserve and protect historic buildings, structures, sites and districts within the boundaries of a zoning district. Such properties are subject to the regulations for the base zoning district and the historic district overlay. If there is a conflict between the requirements of the zoning district and the requirements of the historic district overlay, the historic district overlay requirements apply.
Sec.  21-040-04 Local Register Historic Districts
As established in Chapter Two, Article VII, Division 10 of the Code of the City of Charleston, the Charleston Historic Landmarks Commission is granted the power to designate and maintain a register of locally significant historic districts. The local register may list buildings, districts or sites in three ways. Properties may be listed to honor their significance, to be subject to a temporary stay of demolition, or to be subject to design review. All such districts are recorded on the official Zoning Map of the City of Charleston and applications for new construction, alteration, reconstruction, relocation or demolition may be subject to design review by the Charleston Historic Landmarks Commission.
Sec.  21-040-05 Temporary Stay of Demolition
A.	A Demolition Review Permit is required prior to the demolition of any significant building approved under section 2-695(b) and (c) of the Code of the City of Charleston. The intent of the Demolition Review Permit is to establish a waiting period during which the City, members of the public, and the Applicant can propose and consider alternatives to the demolition of a building that may have significant historical, architectural, cultural or urban design value.

Demolition Review Permits are subject to review by the CHLC and shall be regulated as follows:
1.	The demolition of a significant building may be temporarily delayed for 90 days if the CHLC determines, after a public hearing, that the stay would be in the publics interest due to the buildings significant historical, architectural, cultural or urban design value. If the CHLC chooses to impose the temporary stay of demolition, the stay begins the day the decision is made. 
2.	In considering a Demolition Review Permit, the CHLC may require, the applicant to divulge the proposed use of the property and submit photographic evidence of the existing conditions of the building, structural reports by a certified engineer or architect, and any other information the Commission deems necessary.
3.	A Demolition Review Permit shall be reviewed by the CHLC at a public hearing, except as provided in section 4 below.

Sec.21-060 Neighborhood Reinvestment Overlay District (NRO)
Sec. 21-060-01 Purpose
The Neighborhood Reinvestment Overlay District seeks to uplift distressed communities where disinvestment has resulted in a concentration of dilapidated properties, vacant structures, and under-utilized land.
The NRO promotes vibrant and desirable urban neighborhoods by encouraging housing types ranging from small lot bungalows to duplexes and triplexes, and from townhouses to stacked apartments. This mix of housing types, referred to as the Missing Middle, bridges the gap between the available housing stock and shifting demographics. It responds to the growing demand for walkability in neighborhoods. And because Missing Middle housing types are similar in form and scale to detached single-family homes, this approach to compatible infill can encourage socioeconomically diverse households. 
Missing Middle housing does not represent a new type of building. Rather, it is a return to a range of housing types that were constructed in cities and towns across the United States in the 1920s through the 1940s. Examples of these building types still exist throughout Charlestons urban neighborhoods on the West Side flats and the East End.  As young families fled densely populated areas for single family homes with ample yards in the suburbs after World War II, construction of these building types halted. A return to smaller dwelling units near public transit and a density that will support local businesses is necessary to attract and retain millennials and to serve an aging population.
 Specifically, the NRO attempts to stimulate the economy and boost the housing market by:
1.	Encouraging the development of a range of housing types that meet the needs of households of varying size and income levels while resisting concentrations of either the very poor or the very wealthy.
2.	Concentrating development around public transportation routes to enhance mobility and offer opportunities for lower income households. 
3.	Increasing density to support neighborhood-serving main streetscommercial and mixed use areas where goods and services are available within walking distance of the majority of a neighborhoods residential units.
4.	Creating opportunities for small-scale, neighborhood-based developers to invest in and revitalize their own communities.
To accomplish these goals, the NRO relaxes development standards like setback and parking requirements and permits increased density by allowing duplexes by right and concentrating higher density development on corner properties.

When calculation of the number of required off-street parking spaces results in a fractional number, a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded and a fraction of one-half or more shall be rounded to the next highest whole number. 
B. 	Multiple Uses or Activities 
When two or more uses, activities, or separate establishments are located within the same development, off-street parking shall be provided for each use or separate establishment according to Table 23-060-01.01, Minimum Parking Space Requirements, unless a shared parking plan is approved pursuant to Sec. 23-060-04, Joint and Shared Use Parking, or unless a parking demand analysis is performed per Sec. 23-060-02. In the event that one or more uses within a multi-use development are of a size that would otherwise exempt them from compliance with off-street parking requirements, only one such exemption shall be permitted to be taken for the entire development. 
C. 	Bench Seating 
When seating consists of benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each 20 linear inches of seating space shall be counted as one seat. 
D. 	Employees and Occupants 
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on the number of employees, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable. 
Sec.  23-060-04 Joint and Shared Use Parking 
A. 	The joint use of a parking lot for two or more buildings or uses which are abutting or directly across the public way from each other, may be permitted, except for single-family residential and duplexes, provided that: 
1. 	The total number of spaces is not less than the sum required for various building or uses if computed separately unless the hours of operation are computed separately, except in the CBD district. 
2. 	Each use of the shared spaces shall function as if having been provided separately.   
3.	A written agreement shall be prepared by and between property owners specifying the conditions for sharing and maintaining said spaces(s), and such agreement shall be filed with the City Planning Department. 
B. 	The Planning Director may allow a reduction of total parking requirement up to twenty-five (25) percent: 
1. 	If the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate the parking spaces will be shared with another adjacent land use and the lack of overlap of hours of operation of the land uses justify such a reduction, and
2. 	The applicant provides the Planning Director with a written agreement as described in (A)(3) above, which includes the justification for the reduction. 
C. 	Shared parking facilities shall provide signs on the premises indicating the availability of the facility for the patrons of the participating uses. 
D. 	Modifications to the structures in which the uses are located or changes in tenant occupancy shall require review for compliance with this Section.   
Sec.  23-060-05 Restricted Accessory Parking Lot Standards
A.	Parking spaces in restricted accessory parking lots when approved as either a permitted or conditional use shall count toward fulfilling on-site parking requirements for the use to which the parking lot is accessory.

Sec.  24-100-09 Lighting 
Off-premise signs may be illuminated unless otherwise specified, provided such signs are so constructed that no light bulb, tube, filament or similar source of illumination is visible beyond the property lines.  Signs making use of lights to convey the effect of movement, or flashing, intermittent or variable intensity lighting shall not be permitted.     
Sec.  24-100-10 Movement

¬Sec. 24-130 Message Substitution
Subject to the land owners consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content.  Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting.  This provision prevails over more specific provisions to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any other non-commercial message.  This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.

A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for the building for a period of one year when weather conditions do not permit landscape installation.  Failure to implement the approved landscape plan, including preservation of existing features, or to maintain the landscaping as long as incompatibility of adjoining uses exists, shall be a violation of this ordinance subject to the penalties outlined in Article 37. 
Sec. 25-040 Content of Landscape Plan 
Where required, all landscape plans submitted for approval as a component of a required site plan for all multi-family residential and non-residential uses shall show the entire zoning lot to scale and shall contain the following information: 
A. 	The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, parking lots and drives, roadways and right-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, freestanding electrical equipment, recreation facilities, utility lines and easements, freestanding structural features, and other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved areas; 
B. 	The location, quantity, and size of all proposed planting materials; 
C. 	Existing and proposed grading of the site, including proposed berming; 
D. 	Specification of the type and boundaries of all proposed vegetative ground cover; 
E. 	Design of fences and other significant accessory structures.  
Sec. 25-050 Preservation of Existing Features 
A. 	Trees and shrubs already existing on land subject to the provisions of this section should be preserved wherever feasible, using a minimum of the following criteria: 
1. 	The condition of the vegetation with respect to continued vitality; 
2. 	The practical and economic possibility of designing the location and grades of proposed structures and paving to preserve existing vegetation; 
3. 	Interference with utility services or encroachment into the traffic visibility triangle. 
B. 	Existing trees in landscaped areas that are preserved will contribute to the required landscaping.  For each tree that is preserved, which is greater than 12-inch caliper, the amount of new trees to be installed shall be reduced by two trees.   
Sec. 25-060 General Landscaping Requirements 
All land areas that are not covered with buildings and pavement or used for agricultural purposes shall be appropriately landscaped in accordance with the requirements of this section.  Landscaping shall be provided in the areas specified and of the minimum intensity, specified below. 
A. 	The scale and nature of landscape materials shall be appropriate to the size of the structures and the available space. Materials shall be located to avoid interference with overhead and underground utilities and utility easements or vehicular or pedestrian movement and visibility. Growth characteristics should be carefully considered. 
B. 	Trees shall be planted to maintain a minimum five (5) foot clearance between the tree trunk and structures, building overhangs, walls, fences, and other trees. 
C. 	Plantings should be arranged to promote energy conservation wherever practicable; e.g. use of tall deciduous trees on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun and planting evergreens on the north of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds. 
D. 	All trash dumpsters, trash pads, loading areas consisting of two (2) or more loading spaces, loading docks, building service and outside storage areas shall be screened from land in a residential zone and must be screened if visible from a public street. Such screening may be achieved by using a minimum six (6) foot high, completely opaque fence or wall, a six (6) foot high berm, or a six (6) foot high evergreen screen. The height of screen shall be measured from the grade of the nearest street. 
E. 	Grass and other vegetative ground cover shall be used for all open space, including parking lot islands, except for: 
1. 	Decorative mulch planting beds containing trees and/or shrubs 
2. 	Inert stabilization in areas subject to severe runoff, erosion, or ponding.  
F. 	Where stone or other inert materials are to be used for ground cover, they shall be specifically identified on the landscape plan. Any area not so designated shall be required to have grass or vegetative ground cover. 
G. 	All landscaping shall conform to the regulations established for visibility triangles to maintain safe sight distances and intersections and points of Access as designated in Section 21-030, Safety and Vision. 
H. 	All landscaped areas at the front line of off-street parking spaces shall be protected from encroachment or intrusion of vehicles. 
I. 	In no case may a tree or shrub be planted within a drainage, sewer or utility easement. 
Sec. 25-070 Bufferyard Landscaping Requirements 
A. 	New non-residential buildings that abut a residential zoning district shall provide a landscape buffer ten (10) feet wide and this requirement may supersede the minimum setback requirement for the district.

C. 	New construction and expansions of fifty (50) percent or more of existing floor area are subject to the provisions of this section. 
Sec. 25-080 Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements 
The following landscape requirements applied to parking lots are intended to screen parking areas from the street, prevent large expanses of unbroken paving, and provide shade to cool paved areas during the hot summer months.  
A. 	General Provisions 
All areas of the parking lot not devoted to parking spaces or traffic flow shall be grassed or planted in ground cover, unless otherwise specified. 
B. 	Development with Parking Behind the Building Line  
A four (4) foot perimeter buffer shall be provided, along the property lines, that contains appropriate plantings.   
 
Graphic 25-080.01.  Development with No Parking Between Building Line and Street 
 
C. 	Development with Parking Located Between Building Line and Street 
If any parking is located between the street and the building line, a ten-foot wide buffer with appropriate plantings shall be provided for the length of any parking area abutting the street. 
D. 	Design Standards for Interior Landscaping 
1. 	All interior landscaping required by this ordinance shall be in addition to any perimeter buffers required. 
2.	All parking areas containing more than 20 parking spaces shall provide a minimum of 5% interior landscaping. 
3. 	All parking areas containing 40 or more parking spaces shall provide, for each row of parking spaces, a terminal island with concrete curbs and at least 130 square feet of landscaped area to protect parked vehicles, provide visibility, confine moving traffic to aisles and driveways, and provide shade. Terminal Islands shall be planted with appropriate trees.  These islands may count toward fulfilling the five (5) percent internal landscaping requirement. 
4. 	All parking areas containing 40 or more parking spaces shall provide for each row of parking spaces interior landscaped islands with concrete curbs and at least 100 square feet of landscaped area shall be provided every 20 spaces or less within a row of spaces for multi-family residential or commercial developments. Planting islands should be evenly spaced throughout the parking lot.  A minimum of 50% of interior islands should be planted with appropriate trees to consistently shade paved areas.  Islands shall be utilized where needed to control vehicular circulation and define major drives. These islands may count toward fulfilling the five (5) percent internal landscaping requirement.  To prevent cars from parking too close to trees or damaging shrubs, an extended curb or wheel stop must be provided. Planting islands parallel to parking spaces must be a minimum of five (5) feet wide to allow car doors to swing open.
Sec. 25-090 Modifications 
A. 	Under conditions where a strict interpretation of requirements may be either physically impossible or create practical difficulties, an alternative compliance procedure may be used to maintain the spiritrather than the letterof the law. The proposed solution must equal or exceed standard landscaping requirements. Requests to the Planning Director for use of alternative landscaping schemes may be justified only when one or more of the following conditions apply: 
1. 	The sites involve space limitations or unusually shaped parcels; 
2. 	Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible or impractical; 
3. 	Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer yard is larger than can be provided;  
4. 	Existing utility lines or easements complicate the placement of required plant materials. 
5. 	The applicant must provide a justification statement that describes which of the requirements established by this ordinance will be met with modifications, which project conditions justify using alternatives, and how the proposed measures equal or exceed normal compliance 
B. 	Where compliance is required as a result of change in use or expansion of an existing building and compliance with this section will necessitate removal of existing pavement, the Planning Director may approve a reduction of minimum planting areas, provided that proposed plantings, screens, and other landscape features are substantially equivalent to the minimum requirements in terms of landscaping. 
C. 	After initial approval of the landscape plan the Planning Director may approve any substitute landscape proposal that he/she deems to be equivalent to the approved landscape.  
Sec. 25-100 Installation and Maintenance 
A.	Plant materials shall conform to the requirements described in the latest edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock, which is published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Plants shall be nursery grown. 
B. 	The owner of the premises shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscaping materials on the premises.  All landscape areas shall be kept free of refuse and debris. Fences, walls, and other barriers shall be maintained in good repair.  It is the responsibility of each private property owner to remove any dead, diseased, or dangerous trees or shrubs, or parts thereof, which overhang or interfere with line of sight, traffic control devices, public sidewalks, rights-of-way, or property owned by the City. The City shall have the authority to order the removal of any such trees or shrubs.

Sec.  27-040 	Nonconforming Structure Used for a Permitted Use 
Sec.  27-050 	Nonconforming Use of a Structure or Land 

Sec.  27-010 Purpose 
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival.   
Sec.  27-020 Nonconforming Use Limitations 
A.	 It is recognized that there may exist within the districts established by this ordinance and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments.  Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. 
B. 	It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
C. 	Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently conducted. 
Sec.  27-030 Nonconforming Lots 
In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of this ordinance or any subsequent amendment.  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
Where such a nonconforming lot does not meet the minimum area or width requirements, or both, the following setback requirements shall apply: 
A. 	The minimum front setback shall conform to the clearly prevailing setback pattern of developed lots within the same block fronting the same street.  When an unimproved lot is situated between two lots with existing principal buildings that each have front yard setbacks less than the setback required in that district, then the front yard setback may be reduced to a depth equal to the average of the two adjacent lots, provided that in no case shall a front yard be reduced by more than fifty (50) percent of the required front yard for that district. 
B. 	No side setback shall be less than five (5) feet in any event, unless provided for in this ordinance. 
Sec.  27-040 Nonconforming Structure Used for a Permitted Use 
A lawfully existing structure, which contains a permitted use but does not comply with the other requirements of this ordinance for the zoning district in which it is located, may be continued but shall be subject to the regulations below.  In such cases, however, the failure to meet landscaping or screening requirements shall not be considered nonconforming. 
A. 	Enlargement, repair, alteration.   
A nonconforming structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered, provided no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration shall create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of such structure. 
B. 	Reconstruction.   
In the event a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of up to (60) sixty percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, the structure may be reconstructed on the same foundation, provided the reconstruction is begun within twelve (12) months of the date it was destroyed. 
C.  	Relocation.   
Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any distance for any reason, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
Sec.  27-050 Nonconforming Use of a Structure or Land 
A nonconforming use of a structure or land may be continued so long as otherwise lawful but shall be subject to the regulations below. 
A. 	Enlargement.   
No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, unless the structure and the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which they are located. 
B. 	Ordinary repair and maintenance.   
Ordinary maintenance and repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, shall be permitted, provided these actions shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of the other parts of this section.  Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of a structure, or the restoration of a structure to a safe condition except for a damaged or destroyed structure subject to provisions of Section 27-040(B) of this section, in accordance with the order of the City Building Commissioner. 
C. 	Structural alteration.   
No structural alteration shall be made unless the entire structure and the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which they are located.  However, nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent owners of nonconforming residential structures the right to perform structural alterations which do not increase the number of dwelling units within  the nonconforming residential structure or enlarge its exterior dimension. 
D. 	Damage or destruction.   
In the event a structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of its replacement costs of the entire structure, exclusive of foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the regulations for the district in which they are located. Moreover, if such damage is  sixty (60) percent or less of the replacement cost of the entire structure, no repairs or restoration shall be permitted unless a building permit is obtained and restoration actually begun within one (1) year of the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.   
E. 	Moving.   
 Should a nonconforming use of land or structure be moved, in whole or in part, for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after being moved. 
F. 	Change.   
A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than the same use or a use permitted in the district in which the land is located.  When a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. 
G. 	Discontinuance.   
A nonconforming use which is hereafter  discontinued for any reason, and remains such for a continuous period of one (1) year, shall not thereafter be re-established.  Such location shall thereafter be occupied by a use which conforms to the regulations for the district in which it is located. 
H. 	Nonconforming accessory use.   
A nonconforming accessory use shall not continue to remain after the principal use to which it is accessory has been destroyed, relocated, or abandoned.

Sec.  28-040 	Fees 
Sec.  28-050 	Administrative Interpretations 

Sec.  28-010 Responsibility for Administration and Enforcement 
A. 	It shall be the duty of the Planning Director, or their designee, to: 
1.	Perform zoning reviews of building permit applications as necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
2.	Maintain permanent and current records of applications for all variances, conditional uses, amendments, and other zoning related records required by this ordinance and of the hearings and actions thereon. 
3. 	Conduct investigations as necessary to determine compliance with or violation of this ordinance. 
4.	Participate in the abatement of violations of this ordinance and aid in the prosecution of such violations. 
 	5. 	Maintain in current status the official zoning map. 
 	6. 	Provide information on zoning upon request by citizens and public agencies. 
B. 	The Planning Director may request the Building Commissioner to conduct field investigations of buildings, structures, or uses of land as necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. 
Sec.  28-020 General Provisions 
A. 	No commission, board, agency, officer, or employee of the City shall issue, grant, or approve any permit, license, certificate, or other authorization for any construction, reconstruction, alteration, enlargement, or relocation of any building or structure, or for any use of land or building, that would not be in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
 B.	 In administering the provisions of this ordinance, the standard rule of rounding numbers to the nearest whole shall apply.  When the unit of measurement results in a fraction less than one-half, the fraction shall be disregarded; fractions of one-half or more shall require the addition of one (1) unit of measure. 
Sec.  28-030 Zoning Reviews 
A. 	No building permit pertaining to the construction, enlargement, moving, remodeling, or reconstruction of a structure shall be issued by the Building Commissioner unless approval of the site plan has been granted by the Planning Director.  The Planning Director shall grant approvals only in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance except when he or she receives a written order from the Municipal Planning Commission, City Council, Board of Zoning Appeals, or a court of law in the form of an administrative review, special exception, variance, or judgment as provided in this ordinance.  When required, a change of land use permit must be acquired prior to issuance of a certificate of compliance with the zoning ordinance.  
B. 	For projects that are reviewed administratively, the Planning Director shall make every reasonable effort to review the application and report to the applicant by the end of thirty (30) working days following the day on which a completed application is received.  
Sec.  28-040 Fees 
A. 	Fee Requirement and Payment 
The Schedule of Fees for zoning applications shall be maintained on file with the Planning Department.  The appropriate fee shall be paid by the applicant when the application is submitted for review.  An application shall not be considered complete until the appropriate fee is paid in full to the Planning Department.  The Planning Director may waive fees in unusual or extreme circumstances. 
Approvals shall not be granted nor zoning certificates of compliance issued until the appropriate fee is paid to the Planning Department. 
B. 	Exemption from Fee Requirement 
Governmental agencies shall be exempt from paying fees for zoning permits, land use certificates or any other permit prescribed by these regulations. 
C. 	No part of any filing fee paid pursuant to this section shall be returnable to the applicant or petitioner. 
Sec.  28-050 Administrative Interpretations 
A. 	Authority 
The Planning Director, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of this Article, may render written interpretations, including use interpretations, of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and of any rule or regulations issued pursuant to it. The Planning Director may forward requests for interpretations to the Board of Zoning Appeals, where, in the opinion of the Planning Director, the proposed use is not sufficiently similar to a use expressly listed as a permitted or conditional use on the Land Use Table to allow staff interpretation. 
B. 	The interpretation authority established by this article is intended to recognize that the provisions of this ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. In particular, certain categories of uses are listed as either Permitted or Conditional Uses, but certain specific proposed uses may not clearly fall within the common meaning of any of the listed uses. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this ordinance in light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, an interpretation shall not have the effect of adding to or changing the essential content of this ordinance, but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases. 
C. 	Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations.  
Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation, provided that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion. 
D. 	Application Procedure 
1. 	Applications for interpretations of this ordinance shall be filed on a form provided by the Planning Department and shall contain information describing the nature of the requested information. 
2. 	Action on Application 
The Planning Director shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating any specific precedent, the reasons, and the analysis upon which the determination is based. 
E. 	Standards for Use Interpretations.  
The following standards shall govern the Planning Director and the Board of Zoning Appeals in issuing use interpretations: 
1. 	Any listed use defined in Article 2, Definitions shall be interpreted as therein defined; 
2. 	No use interpretation shall authorize any use in any district unless evidence is presented demonstrating that it will comply with the general district regulations established for that particular district. 
3. 	No use interpretation shall authorize any use in a particular district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses specifically listed as permitted or accessory in such district and is more similar to such uses than to other uses listed as permitted or accessory in another zoning district. 
4. 	If the proposed use is most similar to a use allowed only as a conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation authorizing such use shall be subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to Article 30 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
5. 	No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in question, unless such use meets the standards of Subsections 3 and 4 above. 
F. 	Effect of Favorable Use Interpretations. 
Use interpretations shall only authorize a use in a specific district and shall not allow the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure.  Use interpretations shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City, including, but not limited to, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy, Subdivision Approval, and Site Plan Approval. 
G. 	Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations.  
1.	A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted, or allowed as a conditional use in a particular district, shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it is issued, and such interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has not been issued. 
2. 	Once a use interpretation is made for a particular use in a particular district, that use interpretation shall be permitted as a use for the entire district and shall be available for other property owners in that district. 
H. 	Appeals from Planning Director Decisions.  
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall, pursuant to Article 32 of this Zoning Ordinance, hear and decide appeals from any administrative interpretations by the Planning Director acting pursuant to the authority and duties under this section.

CONDITIONAL USES

Sec.  30-010 	General Provisions 
Sec.  30-020 	Application for Conditional Use Approval 
Sec.  30-030 	Standards for Approval 
Sec.  30-040 	Conditional Approval 
Sec.  30-050 	Expiration of Conditional Use Permit 

Sec.  30-010 General Provisions 
A. 	Purpose 
It is the purpose of this article to recognize that there may be cases where community and Comprehensive Plan goals are met by flexible and individual regulation of land uses within a zoning district.  The establishment of a conditional use permit procedure provides such flexibility to provide for certain uses which shall be permitted only if adequate conditions exist or can be imposed that will make such uses compatible with the purposes of this ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan.  The conditional use permit procedure shall provide for some measure of individualized judgment and the imposing of conditions on certain uses, in order to make them compatible with uses in the surrounding area.  It is further intended that the conditional use permit, through a site plan review process, shall provide a method whereby it can be determined whether or not a use would cause any damage, hazard, nuisance, or other detriment to persons or property in the vicinity. 
B.	 Standards and Requirements 
Conditional uses are declared to possess characteristics of such unique and special form that each specific land use must be considered as an individual case.  Consideration by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be based on adopted standards and requirements.  These considerations shall be general, applying to all conditional uses, and specific, applying to individual types of conditional uses.  The standards and requirements stipulated in this article shall be made a condition of approval.   In addition, the Board may impose additional, reasonable conditions to fit the particular use and site under review. 
C. 	Limits of Authorization 
A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use specified in the permit. 
D. 	Review 
If a conditional use permit meets the thresholds for a Development of Significant Impact or a Major Development of Significant Impact as set forth in Article 33, Planning Commission approval of the application for Development of Significant Impact criteria and Board of Zoning Appeals approval of the application as a conditional use request are both required before a permit shall be issued.

A. 	The proposed use is compatible with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan. 
B. 	The proposed use shall be compatible with the appropriate and orderly development of the district, taking into consideration the location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved in or conducted in connection with such use, the size of the site in relation to the use, the assembly of persons in connection with the use, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to the site. 
C. 	The proposed site development shall be such that the use will not hinder nor discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings, taking into consideration the location, nature and height of buildings, the location, nature and height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site. 
D. 	Neighborhood character and surrounding property values shall be reasonably safeguarded. 
E. 	Operations in connection with the use shall not be offensive, dangerous, destructive of property values and basic environmental characteristics, or detrimental to the public interest of the community.

F. 	The character and appearance of the proposed use, buildings, structures, and/or outdoor signs shall be in general harmony or better, with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood. 
G.	The Board shall have the authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed conditional use permit. 
Sec.  30-040 Conditional Approval 
A. 	A conditional use approval may be denied or revoked where the applicant fails to comply with specific conditions made a part of the approval by the Board, or fails to comply with a reasonable request of the Board for furnishing specific information related to the proposed use. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance.
B. 	If there are other valid reasons for denying a conditional use application, the denial may be sustained even if the proposed conditional use constitutes the highest and best use which can be made of the subject property.  The Board may not deny a permit solely for the purpose of limiting the number of similar uses in an area.  
Sec. 30-050 Expiration of Conditional Use Permit 
In the case where a Conditional Use Permit has not been used within twelve (12) months after the granting thereof, then without further action it shall be null and void.  This may be extended to eighteen (18) months upon prior written request of the Board.

B. No lot, tract or parcel of land will be subdivided, and no land will be developed, and no street, alley, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main or related facility will be laid out, constructed, opened or dedicated for public use or travel, or for the use of occupants of buildings abutting or to abut on them, except according to the provisions of this ordinance, any other applicable ordinances of the City, and the City of Charleston Comprehensive Plan.

B. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. Where the conditions imposed by, or pursuant to, these regulations are different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law, the provisions which are more restrictive and which impose the higher/greater standards shall control.
C. The provisions of this Ordinance are separable. If any part or provision of these regulations or their application to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or their application to other persons or circumstances. The City hereby declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision or application.

3. When requested by the applicant, the City shall furnish the applicant with a signed copy of the decision of the Planning Commission or Planning Director indicating approval of the Final Plat contingent upon the providing of financial security by the applicant. The Final Plat shall not be signed or recorded until the financial improvements agreement has been executed. The written decision of the Planning Commission or Planning Director and letter of contingent approval shall expire if the financial improvements agreement is not executed and delivered within ninety days, unless an extension to such period has been granted in writing by the Planning Commission. Any request for such an extension shall be submitted in writing from the applicant to the Planning Commission.
4. The financial security shall provide for and secure to the public the completion of all improvements for which the security is being posted within one (1) year of the date of Final Plat approval for completion of such improvements.

The new amount shall not exceed one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of completing the remaining required improvements as established upon the expiration date of the preceding one year period, as described in Section B6 above.
9. Where development is projected over a period of years, the City may authorize submission of Final Plats by phase of development, subject to such requirements or guarantees for improvements within the future phase(s) of development which are necessary to secure the proper functioning of any improvements within any finally approved phase(s) of the development.
10. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the Planning Commission to release or to authorize the release of such portions of the financial security representing the cost of improvements properly completed in accordance with City specifications. Any such requests shall be in writing, addressed to the Planning Commission. The Commission shall have forty-five (45) days from the receipt of such request within which to allow the City Engineer to certify in writing to the Commission that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved plans. Upon such certification, the Commission shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the City Engineer fairly representing the values of the improvements completed.
11. The City Engineer, in certifying the completion of work for a partial release, shall not be bound to the amount requested by the applicant, but shall certify to the Planning Commission his independent evaluation of the proper amount of partial releases.
C. Release from Improvements Guarantee
1. When the applicant has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, he shall notify the Planning Commission of the completion of the required improvements. Upon receipt of such notice, the City Engineer shall give a final inspection to the improvements covered by the guarantee.
