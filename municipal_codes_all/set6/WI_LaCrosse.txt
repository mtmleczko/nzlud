PREFACE\ 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of La Crosse, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented and amended through April 16, 2014. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Teri Lehrke, City Clerk, Mr. Stephen F. Matty, City Attorney, and Ms. Brenda Buddenhagen, Paralegal, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

At all times, whether a special meeting of a governmental body is held shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the City subject to any other applicable statutes and ordinances. After a determination that a special meeting will not occur, a refund of the fee shall be repaid to the requester, except for that portion of the fee disbursed by the City in good faith reliance of the request. 
(6)  Definitions. For this subsection, the following terms shall be defined as follows: 
a.  The term "special meeting" means a meeting of any governmental body of the City of La Crosse, requiring public notice, other than a regularly scheduled meeting. 
b.  The term "extraordinary circumstances" does not include a lack of planning or preparation on behalf of the requester to timely submit the new business before the governmental body. Extraordinary circumstances shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the City official or department head through whose office the request originated, subject to review by the City Attorney.

Sec. 2-262. - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stat. § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under section 2-261. A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or Federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize the request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2-263. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon the petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stat. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney. 
(Code 1980, § 2.36(E)) 
Sec. 2-263. - Limitations on right to access.

(b)  Whenever the Assessor, in the performance of the Assessor's duties, requests or obtains income and expense information pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 70.47(7)(af), or any successor statute thereto, then, such income and expense information that is provided to the Assessor shell be held by the Assessor on a confidential basis; except, however, that the information may be revealed to and used by persons: in the discharging of duties imposed by law; in the discharge of duties imposed by office, including, but not limited to, use by the Assessor in performance of official duties of the Assessor's office and use by the Board of Review in performance of its official duties; or pursuant to order of a court.

ARTICLE IX. - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 2-402. - Findings of fact, statement of purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The City of La Crosse is essentially landlocked and the future economic prosperity of the City is primarily dependent on redevelopment of existing land uses. Redevelopment of sites, buildings and land typically has a higher up-front cost than "greenfield" suburban development as a result of potential environmental contamination, existing buildings that need to be removed or renovated, and smaller parcels that need to be assembled to create development sites. The Legislature has recognized this and has allowed cities to conduct economic development programs primarily through Tax Incremental Finance Districts (TID), the use of loans, grants, Industrial Revenue Bonds, land write downs, and provision of public infrastructure. A comprehensive program of economic development, including the prudent use of incentives, protects the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base of the City. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. This article is intended to regulate economic development programs and incentives to: 
(1)  Protect life, health, property and general welfare of the City; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for development and redevelopment projects; 
(3)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(4)  Implement a high profile proactive approach to local economic development through public/private partnerships; 
(5)  Provide a range of development incentives, as needed, to retain local employers and to stimulate their expansion; 
(6)  Facilitate the redevelopment and revitalization of the downtown and older commercial areas; 
(7)  Attract a variety of manufacturing and regional office employers in business sectors with projected growth; 
(8)  Provide both existing and new employers with a consistent set of standards for the City's approach to incentive programs for projects located on private and/or publicly owned sites; 
(9)  To facilitate the use of Federal and State development incentive programs and grants for local development projects. 
(10)  Maximize the effectiveness of the City's limited resources in stimulating job-creating development projects; 
(11)  Compete on an equal basis with other communities for an increased share of new development projects; 
(12)  Assist the City in implementing its overall economic development goals; 
(13)  Enable the City to compete globally by actively creating and retaining an educated work force. 
(Code 1980, § 2.23(A)) 
Sec. 2-403. - Economic Development Commission. 
(a)  Purpose.

(Code 1980, § 2.23(B)-(D); Ord. No. 4996 , § I, 5-11-2017) 
Sec. 2-404. - Standards for economic development assistance. 
(a)  The standards outlined herein are intended to provide clear direction and understanding to applicants, City staff, the Commission and Common Council for projects and developments needing City assistance, including those within tax increment financing (TIF) districts and projects outside of TIF districts. These standards and requirements have been promulgated to protect the public's trust and resources and to ensure that City government treats all applicants fairly and equitably. Notwithstanding compliance with any or all of the standards herein, the provision of assistance is a policy choice to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the Common Council. The burden of establishing the public value of assistance shall be placed upon the applicant and the application must substantially meet the criteria contained herein. The Commission reserves the right to bring any incentive proposal forward for Council consideration. Meeting statutory requirements, standards or other criteria listed herein does not guarantee the provision of TIF financial assistance nor does the approval or denial of one project set precedent for approval or denial of another project. 
(b)  If the applicant is looking for funding from the City's established economic development loan programs: Small Business Development Loan Program/Commercial Rehabilitation Loan Program, Upper Floor Renovation Revolving Loan Program, Facade Improvement Programs, or the Architectural and Engineering Analysis Program, the applicant should follow the specific loan application process, and should expect a 60-day turnaround from the City. If, however, the applicant is looking for assistance through Tax Incremental District loans/grants or other forms of assistance, the applicant should expect a four- to six-month turnaround from the City, depending on the scope of the project and type of assistance requested. 
(c)  The City will consider using financial assistance to assist private development in those circumstances where the proposed private project shows a demonstrated financial gap and that the financial assistance request is the minimum necessary to make the project feasible. It is the Commission's discretion whether to require the developer to have exhausted every other financial alternative(s) prior to requesting the use of financial assistance, including equity participation, other Federal and State funds, bonds, tax credits, loans, etc. It is the intent of the City to provide the minimum amount of assistance to make the project viable and not solely to increase a developer's profit margin on the project. As part of a formal request for assistance through a completed application, the City will undertake, at the requestor's cost, an independent analysis of the project to ensure the request for assistance is necessary and valid. 
(d)  Each project is unique and therefore every proposal shall be evaluated on its individual merit, including its potential impact on City service levels, its overall contribution to the economy and its consistency with the Comprehensive Plan or other planning documents. Each project must demonstrate probability of financial success. The developer must demonstrate that there will be a substantial and significant public benefit to the community by achieving as many of the following public benefits as possible: 
(1)  Stimulate revitalization of the City, its older neighborhoods, industrial areas, commercial districts and Historic Downtown La Crosse by: 
a.  Improving infrastructure; 
b.  Meeting job creation requirements as referenced in the City's Living Wage Resolution as amended or superseded; 
c.  Retaining existing jobs; 
d.  Creating a variety of mixed-use commercial/housing opportunities to increase the number of downtown residents; 
e.  Attracting desirable businesses and retaining existing businesses; 
f.  Encouraging development projects that enhance the streetscape and pedestrian experience and improve the vitality of the downtown area by adding interest and activity on the first floor of mixed-use buildings; 
g.  Promoting use of mass transit by actively promoting and participating in the MTU Works pass program for employees. 
(2)  Promote efficient usage of land through elimination of blight and redevelopment of underutilized properties. 
(3)  Strengthen the economic and employment base of the City and support Economic Development. 
(4)  Stabilize and upgrade targeted neighborhoods. 
(5)  Increase property values, tax base and tax revenues. 
(6)  Leveraging the maximum amount of non-City funds into a development and back into the community. 
(7)  Supporting an educated workforce. 
(8)  Contribute to other unique projects or programs not listed that provide public benefits. 
(e)  The following standards shall be met in order for the applicant requesting public funding to demonstrate the financial need for public assistance: 
(1)  "But for" standard (i.e., demonstration of need for the public assistance). The fundamental principle and that which the City must determine through information provided by the developer is that the project would not occur "but for" the assistance provided through City financial assistance. The burden is on the developer to make its case to the City. City financial assistance will be provided solely to fill an identified financial "gap" and the City's assistance will be restricted to the minimum amount necessary to make a project financially feasible. It is at the Commission's discretion to define the amount and form of financial assistance. 
(2)  Every other financial alternative is expected to be explored prior to the request for City assistance, including obtaining primary financing through conventional lenders, seeking additional investment and/or partners, and seeking other Federal and State funds, bonds, tax credits, loans, etc. The developer shall provide copies of correspondence from lenders, business partners/investors and copies of applications (Prospect Data Sheet) for State assistance through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation or other State or Federal agencies. 
(3)  Demonstration of need can be provided in the form of, but not limited to, personal financial statements, income tax returns, commitment letters, cash flow statements, project pro forma's, feasibility studies, industry data, and market demand studies, etc. Upon request, the City may permit these documents to be provided directly to the City's financial advisor or developer's financial advisor to protect proprietary or confidential information. 
(4)  To meet the public purpose doctrine, job creation and retention will be a requirement for economic assistance (with the exception of Upper Floor Loans or facade loans or other forms of financial assistance that are not expected to create jobs) and the City may require job records and retention of jobs for a period of time. If the promised jobs are not created and retained for the agreed to period of time, then the City's financial assistance may become due and payable immediately. The City will not provide financial incentives for job creation on a per job basis and will work with the applicant to obtain State of Wisconsin and other job creation tax credits for which these programs are intended. 
(5)  Eligible projects. In order for the project to receive financial assistance, the project shall consist of the following types of development projects: 
a.  Business development (attraction, retention, expansion) for basic industries (businesses that export products), assistance will be evaluated on its impact on existing local markets. 
b.  Mixed-use developments that creatively integrate commercial and retail projects into a residential development. 
c.  Revitalization of historically designated, significant or deteriorated buildings.

c.  Relocation (pirating) of tenants from another site within the City or region (offices, retail and/or other commercial uses) for the purpose other than retaining or substantially expanding said business. 
d.  Office or retail development outside of Downtown unless within a redevelopment project that is targeting mixed-use commercial/office and residential such as Caledonia Street and the I-90/Exit 3 commercial nodes. 
e.  Standalone big box commercial. 
f.  Standalone residential development projects unless limited by site and environmental conditions beyond which make the project financially infeasible, including luxury housing or 100 percent market rate housing. 
g.  Standalone student housing. 
h.  Projects not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(f)  Structure for financing assistance. The following parameters are established for providing financial assistance. 
(1)  Financial assistance may be provided by the City in a form and method acceptable to the City. Requests for up-front financing may be considered on a case-by-case basis if increment generation is sufficient to meet initial financing and debt service costs and are not the first dollars spent on a project. 
(2)  For "pay-go" and reverse cash grant structured projects, the project owner shall agree to pay all other outstanding City of La Crosse property tax bills and special assessments prior to disbursement of any payments by the City. 
(3)  No mortgage guarantees. The City will not provide mortgage guarantees. 
(4)  Personal guarantees. The City will require personal guarantees from the investor, borrower and members for receiving financial assistance. Amount and form shall be acceptable to the City. 
(5)  The City will retain an administrative fee of not less than 15 percent of any tax increment received from the project to reimburse for administrative costs. 
(6)  When the project is intended as a for-sale development (i.e., office, mixed use retail/residential), the developer must retain ownership of the overall project until final completion; provided, however, that individual condominium units may be sold as they are completed. For all other projects, the developer must retain ownership of the project at least long enough to complete it, to stabilize its occupancy, to establish the project management and to initiate payment of taxes based on the increased project value. Transfer of ownership or the addition of owners/members or changes to ownership/member percentages shall first be approved as an amendment to the developer's agreement. 
(7)  Projects receiving assistance will be subject to a "look back" provision. The look back mandates a developer to provide the City or its financial advisor with evidence of its annualized cumulative internal rate of return on the investment (IRRI) at specified periods of time after project completion. The IRRI shall be calculated with equity, revenues, and expenses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
a.  When the developer owns the subject property and rents space to tenants, supporting documentation shall include certified records of project costs and revenues, including lease agreements and sales on a per square foot basis at no cost to the City. If the records indicate that the developer has received a higher return on equity, a higher return on cost, or a higher internal rate of return than originally proposed to the City at the time of the development agreement, the developer and the City shall split, on a 50/50 basis, the increase above the originally projected rates of return. 
b.  When the subject property is a for-sale development and the IRRI cannot be completed, the developer is to provide financial data after the project is completed at no cost to the City. This shall include a calculation of profit on total development costs minus the financial assistance. If the financial records indicate that the developer has received a higher return on equity, a higher return on cost, or a higher internal rate of return than originally contemplated at the time of development agreement approval, the developer and the City shall split, on a 50/50 basis, any increase at or above original projected rates of return. 
(8)  Loans using Federal or City funds, including State Trust Funds, shall generally follow the same underwriting standards and procedures as grants or other financing mechanisms contained herein. The City shall use its standard loan documents used for the Small Business Development Loan/Commercial Rehabilitation Loans for all development loans. 
(g)  All of the following financial criteria must be met in order to be considered for economic assistance. 
(1)  Equity requirement. Developers must provide a minimum 15 percent equity of total project costs. Projects that exceed the 15 percent equity requirement will be looked upon favorably by the City. Equity is defined as cash or un-leveraged value in land or prepaid costs attributable to the project. City assistance shall not exceed the amount of equity provided by the developer. Donated developer or construction management fees shall not be considered as equity investment. 
(2)  Payback period. 20-year maximum payback period. Preference will be given to projects with payback periods of 12 years or less. 
(3)  TIF cap . The total amount of TIF assistance should not exceed ten percent of the increase in taxable valuation. This limitation may be modified by special consideration as outlined in (i). 
(4)  Land assembly cap. Assistance for land/property assembly costs will not be provided in an amount exceeding ten percent of the fair market value of the land. The fair market value will be determined by an independent appraiser contracted by the City with the cost of appraisal paid for by developer. 
(5)  Sale of City-owned land . For development projects involving the sale of City-owned land, the procedures in section 2-404(m) must be followed. 
(6)  Internal rate of return. The amount of assistance provided to a developer will be limited to the amount necessary to provide the developer a reasonable rate of return on investment in the project and the subject site. A developer's return on equity, return on cost or internal rate of return will be based on current market conditions as determined by the City or City's financial advisor. In no case shall the internal rate of return exceed 30 percent. 
(7)  Taxable increase. The project should result in an increase in taxable valuation of at least 20 percent upon project completion. 
(8)  Living wage requirements. The City has adopted, by resolution, a policy that developments that are provided City assistance must pay their employees a "living wage." Any agreement for financial assistance shall include provisions that ensure the publicly assisted projects pay a living wage to their employees. 
(9)  PILOT payment. In the event that some or all of the property, developments, improvements, personal property, or real estate becomes exempt from general property taxes the developer shall make a payment to the City in lieu of taxes (the " PILOT").

The Board of Public Works shall annually request the surplus property listing from each Department to ensure annual compliance. 
(2)  Property may only be offered for sale if it is first determined to be "surplus" by the Board or Committee that oversees such land and by Common Council resolution.

a.  Lands that are deemed of local interest, such as a parcel smaller than 7,200 square feet or a remnant parcel created as a result of a highway construction project or remnant or surplus parcels that would only have an interest by the abutting property owner, shall only be required to be advertised via a legal ad in the La Crosse Tribune.

b.  Land sold to non-profit entities or corporations for municipal public purpose. 
c.  Land sold in the City's industrial/business parks, land sold for industrial purposes, or land sold by the Redevelopment Authority where Wisconsin Law otherwise authorizes sale of industrial or Redevelopment Authority lands.

Sec. 4-171. - Purpose and findings. 
    The Common Council of the City of La Crosse intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons civilly responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Common Council of the City of La Crosse finds: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some circumstances, provide the alcohol. 
(5)  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

If the Height Limitations Zoning Map, La Crosse Regional Airport, La Crosse, Wisconsin indicates "Permit Required" instead of a height, a permit must be obtained, regardless of height. The provisions of the AOZD within this article shall apply to all areas indicated in this Map. 
(b)  Airport Overlay Zoning District . All La Crosse Regional Airport Overlay Zones established by this article are shown on the La Crosse Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map which shall bear the signature of the Mayor of the City attested by the City Clerk and shall be on file in the office of the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. These six zones encompass a three-mile radius from the La Crosse Regional Airport property line, as authorized by Wisconsin Statutes. No land use shall be allowed nor shall any structure be constructed, altered, located, or permitted which encroaches upon the La Crosse Regional Airport creating hazards for aircraft, airport operational area, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as nearby citizens. For the purpose of this article, the area of La Crosse County under the jurisdiction of this article is hereby divided into the following zones as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. 
(1)  Zone A-Runway Protection Zone. Zone A is a trapezoidal shape which includes the area off the end of each runway which is designed to enhance the protection of people and property on the ground. 
(2)  Zone B-Approach Service. Zone B is critical overlay zoning surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at the Airport. The size of Zone B is the combinations of Zone B1, B2, and B3 and is predicted on a 50:1 approach surface. 
a.  Zone B1-The length of Zone B1 extends 3,750 feet from the outer edge of Zone A. 
b.  Zone B2-Zone B2 extends 3,750 feet beyond the outer edge of Zone B1. 
c.  Zone B3-Zone B3 extends from Zone B2 in the 50:1 approach, ending at the three-mile boundary. 
(3)  Zone C-Transitional Surface. The areas within Zone C are those that extend 1,050 feet outward from the edge of the primary surface, paralleling the runway and extended edge of the primary surface, paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline with Zone B1, to a length equal to the outer edge of Zone A and then squared to meet Zone A. 
(4)  Zone D-Three-Mile Jurisdictional Boundary. Zone D encompasses the horizontal innermost area, all of which represents the three-mile jurisdictional boundary, as provided for in Wis. Stat. §§ 114.135 and 114.136. Zone D is calculated by intersecting a series of three-mile arcs drawn from the outermost property boundaries of the Airport.

Subdivision II. - Use Restrictions 

Sec. 8-168. - Generally. 
    Through the use of the La Crosse Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, heights of structures and features, both manmade and natural growth, shall be limited. 
(Code 1980, § 13.01(D)(1)) 
Sec. 8-169. - Exceptions. 
    The restrictions contained in this section shall not apply to temporary cranes, temporary lifts, temporary scaffolding, and other similar temporary equipment used for normal and routine construction, provided that a permit with any conditions has been issued by the Department of Planning and Development after obtaining the approval of the La Crosse Regional Airport Director and, if required, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a part of the FAA 7460-1 notification process. 
(Code 1980, § 13.01(D)(3); Ord. No. 4943 , § VII, 7-14-2016) 
Sec. 8-170. - Specific restrictions. 
    The following specific use restrictions and regulations shall also apply: 
(1)  Existing uses . All existing property uses allowed by the current zoning classifications, within the zones defined by this article are allowed to remain, subject to applicable Federal, State, and local requirements, including height limitations set forth in this article. This includes the constructions of ancillary uses, such as garages, subject to existing local requirements. Nothing contained in this article shall require the removal of or any change in the construction, alteration, location, or use of any existing use; this includes the construction, alteration, or use of property or structural improvements lawfully in existence on October 21, 2012, or which commenced prior to October 21, 2012, and has been completed or is being diligently pursued. This includes vacant platted lots that were established to accommodate proposed development prior to October 21, 2012. It is further provided that the height limits of this article shall in no event be exceeded by more than ten feet. If a use penetrates the applicable height limitation by ten feet or less, it must be approved through the permitting process. 
a.  Partial/complete destruction or reconstruction. The owner of any existing use, building, or structure which, as a result of fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty is destroyed or is demolished by the owner, shall be allowed to rebuild, reconstruct, or rehabilitate the same existing use on the same parcel, provided the following requirements are met: The existing use is reviewed and complies with the La Crosse Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, and is not otherwise prohibited by the underlying zoning ordinance of the municipality with jurisdictional authority. 
b.  Expansion of existing uses. Any existing use, as described in this article, may be expanded, altered, or otherwise enlarged as long as the following requirements are met: 
1.  The expansion, alteration, or enlargement meets the requirements of the La Crosse Regional Airport Height Limitations Zoning Map, meets the criteria for the existing land use with no change in zoning classification, and is not otherwise prohibited by the underlying zoning ordinance of the municipality with jurisdictional authority. 
2.  Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, altered, or rebuilt, a permit shall be applied for and secured in the manner prescribed by section 8-172, authorizing such change, replacement, or repair. No such permit shall be denied if the structure will not become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was on the effective date of this article, or than it was when the application for permit was made. 
(2)  Future land use. Any changes in land use, requiring a zoning reclassification are subject to the land use restrictions set forth below and illustrated in Table 3 titled "Future Land Use Compatibility Chart" and are to be evaluated with the criteria set forth in the AOZD checklist which has been made effective January 19, 2010, and is hereby adopted by reference. 
a.  Permitted uses are those land uses generally considered compatible within a particular zone of the AOZD. Compatible land uses do not impact or create hazardous conditions for aircraft, airport operational areas, or aircraft overflight areas, and are considered reasonably safe for nearby residents. Permitted uses, however, shall conform to all Height Restrictions within the AOZD. A permit and AOZD checklist are not required for compliance with this article. 
b.  Permit required uses are those land uses that shall be permissible following the issuance of a permit. The permit, which may include development and use-related conditions, along with a signed AOZD checklist, notifies applicants of their responsibilities and required mitigation for any construction, alteration, location or use of land to minimize potential hazardous impacts to the La Crosse Regional Airport, aircraft, airport operational areas, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as nearby residents. Any use exceeding the height limitations by ten feet or less require a permit regardless of the type of land use. 
c.  Not permitted uses are those land uses generally considered not compatible (incompatible) and/or not permitted within a particular zone of the AOZD. Incompatible land uses endanger the health, safety, and welfare of nearby residents and aircraft utilizing the La Crosse Regional Airport. 
(Code 1980, § 13.01(D)(2); Ord. No. 4943 , §§ VIII-X, 7-14-2016) 
Sec. 8-171. - Hazard marking and lighting. 
(a)  All uses must comply with the FAA's requirements for marking and lighting per the current version of Advisory Circular 70-7460 Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Additionally, any permit may, if such action is deemed advisable by the La Crosse Regional Airport Management, Wisconsin Department of Transportation Bureau of Aeronautics (WI DOT BOA) and/or the FAA, require the owner of a structure or trees, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers, light, and navigational aids as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of a hazard, at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Prohibited uses in the Airport Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Any use that would exceed the Height Restrictions indicated in the Height Limitations Zoning Map by more than ten feet. 
(2)  Any use that is not permitted according to Table 3 - Land Use Compatibility Chart.

(1)  Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, State or community; 
(2)  Are identified with historic personages or with important events in national, State or local history; 
(3)  Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen, inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or 
(4)  Are representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer or architect whose individual genius influenced such master's age. 
(b)  The Commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for landmark sites designation providing such are in conformance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  A fee in the amount established by resolution shall be paid by the owner of said property to the City of La Crosse in connection with said historic designation. 
(Code 1980, § 2.27(E)) 
Sec. 20-91. - Voluntary restrictive covenants. 
    The owner of any historic structure or site may, at any time following such designation of his property, enter into a restrictive covenant on the subject property after negotiation with the Commission.

The owner shall record such covenant in the County Register of Deeds Office, and shall notify the City Assessor of such covenant and the conditions thereof. 
(Code 1980, § 2.27(G)(2)) 
Sec. 20-92. - Regulation of construction, reconstruction or alteration. 
(a)  Prior to applying for a permit from the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety involving the exterior of a designated historic site or historic structure, an application for a certificate of recommendation shall be filed with the Commission, in the Department of Planning and Development. 
(b)  The applicant shall submit a detailed description of the proposed construction, reconstruction or alteration together with any architectural drawings, if those services have been utilized by the applicant, and a sufficient description of the construction or alteration and use to enable the Commission to determine what the final appearance of the structure will be. 
(c)  No owner or person in charge of a historic site or historic structure shall construct or alter all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property until a certificate of recommendation has been issued by the Commission. The request for a certificate of recommendation for such sites shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee in the amount established by resolution. Until such certificate of recommendation has been issued by the Commission, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(d)  Upon filing of any application with the Commission, the Commission shall within 45 days of receipt of the application consider and may give weight, in issuing its certificate of recommendation, to any or all of the following: 
(1)  Whether the property will be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  Whether the historic character of the property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall be discouraged. 
(4)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved. 
(5)  Deteriorated historic features should be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature should match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. 
(6)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials should not be used. The surface cleaning of historic structures shall be undertaken using the methods promulgated by Department of Safety and Professional Services pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 101.1215. 
(7)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction should not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work should be differentiated from the old and should be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(8)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction should be undertaken in such a matter that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(9)  The "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation" (36 CFR 67 and 68 as amended). 
(e)  The Commission shall issue the certificate of recommendation within 45 days of the filing of the application. The certificate of recommendation shall serve as a nonbinding recommendation only. During such period of review, the Commission shall work with the applicant to preserve the historical attributes of any structure or building. 
(f)  The issuance of a certificate of recommendation shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by applicable Federal, State or local code. Insofar as they are applicable to a historic site or historic structure designated under this section, any provision of the plumbing code, electrical code, or building or housing code of the City shall apply, unless waived by the appropriate State or City officials. The Commission may support or propose such waivers before the appropriate State or City appeals body. 
(g)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of recommendation provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or historic site or the replacement of elements of a structure with materials similar in appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit.

Sec. 20-93. - Regulation of demolition. 
(a)  Prior to applying for a permit from the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety to demolish all or part of the exterior of a historic structure, historic site, or structure or contributing building in a historic district, an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition along with a fee as established by resolution shall be filed with the Commission, in the Department of Planning and Development. 
(b)  The Commission may decide to grant the certificate of appropriateness for demolition or refuse to grant such Certificate. If the Commission fails to act on the application for the certificate of appropriateness for demolition within 45 days of the application date, it will be deemed an issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. During such period, the applicant and the Commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property. 
(c)  In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the Commission shall consider and may give weight to any or all of the following: 
(1)  Whether the building or structure is of such architectural or historic significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the City and the State; 
(2)  Whether the building or structure, although not itself a designated historic structure, contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic character of the district as a whole and therefore should be preserved for the benefit of the City and State; 
(3)  Whether the building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense; 
(4)  Whether the building or structure is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore it; provided, however, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created or which is the result of inexcusable neglect to maintain the property in good repair shall not qualify as a basis for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; 
(5)  Whether the denial of the permit would result in the loss of all reasonable and beneficial use of or return from the property.

Sec. 22-22. - Declaration of policy. 
    The practice of providing equal opportunities in housing, places of public accommodations and amusement, and City facilities without regard to sex, race, religion, color, national origin or ancestry, age, disability, marital status, lawful source of income, physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political activity, familial status, domestic partnership, or the fact that such person is a student as defined herein is a desirable goal of the City of La Crosse and a matter of legitimate concern to its government. Discrimination against any of La Crosse's citizens or visitors endangers the rights and privileges of all. Denial of equal opportunity in housing compels individuals and families who are discriminated against to live in dwellings below the standards to which they are entitled. Denial of equal opportunity in public accommodations subjects those discriminated against to embarrassment and creates distress and unrest within the community. Provision for adequate safeguards against such discrimination is a proper and necessary function of City government. In order that the peace, freedom, safety and general welfare of all inhabitants of the City may be protected and ensured, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the City of La Crosse to foster and enforce to the fullest extent the protection by law of the rights of all of its inhabitants to equal opportunity to housing, the use of City facilities and places of public accommodations and amusement without regard to sex, race, religion, color, national origin or ancestry, age, disability, marital status, lawful source of income, physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political activity, familial status, domestic partnership, or the fact that such person is a student as defined herein.

One member shall be a member of the Common Council. Members shall be appointed from among the residents of the entire City, and shall be committed to the principle of equal opportunities. They shall receive no compensation for their services. 
(1)  The Commission members shall be appointed for terms of three years and their terms shall run until their successors are appointed and confirmed. Terms shall expire on March 1. 
(2)  The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:

If a witness either fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued by the Commission, the Commission may order attendance. At any time after it has issued such an order, the Commission may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for its enforcement;

i.  To refer orders, under this article, to the City Attorney to be enforced by the City Attorney in the name of the City of La Crosse;

m.  To enter into cooperative agreements with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Equal Rights Division which agreements shall provide that the City of La Crosse Human Rights Commission shall refer those complaints which are covered under Wisconsin Housing or Public Accommodation laws which would require significant investigation and which would exceed the annual budget of the Commission;

Such appeal shall be made in writing with a copy served upon the Commission within 45 days of the complainant's receipt of such final determination of the Commission.

The complainant and respondent shall be informed of all such referrals. 
(k)  The process defined in section 22-24 not exclusive. The Complainant and/or Respondent may have other rights, causes of action, remedies available in other forums such as the ERD, EEOC or HUD.

Chapter 39 - COMMUNITY EVENTS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 39-1. - Purpose.
The City of La Crosse encourages and supports community events that occur within the city limits because they serve an important role in enhancing the City's quality of life and can provide benefits to the community. The City's goal is to encourage and help coordinate special community events, while regulating these events in a positive manner to ensure the health and safety of participants in the event, efficient management of City services and the protection of public lands and facilities.

Such events are allowed subject to the reasonable requirements contained in City ordinances and the established policies and procedures. Proper planning, review and coordination with the City will ensure that special events are executed as efficiently and safely as possible. During the City's review and oversight in this process, the City will address traffic and parking issues, health and safety issues related to the participants and the public, effects upon neighboring properties, fire potential, explosions, disorder and other dangers to persons or property, preservation of peace and order, sanitation and the overall safeguarding of the public. The City will also consider the potential diversion of public safety, emergency and other services from their regular and necessary duties, and the additional costs of providing public services necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare associated with special events.

The City also recognizes that marches and public assemblies held for the purpose of conveying messages protected by the Constitution play an important role in enhancing the public life of citizens as well as the interrelationship between citizens and their government. To that end, the City will similarly review requests to hold marches and public assemblies in the context of the safety and welfare of the community and the availability of resources, but will do so in an expedited and abbreviated manner to ensure that those wishing to hold and/or participate in such events may do so without unreasonable delays or restrictions.

Sec. 40-14. - Green Complete Streets. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the City's Green Complete Streets regulation is to establish standards to safeguard life and property and promote and preserve public welfare and community aesthetics and to allow citizens to enjoy the use of streets and corridors within the City of La Crosse by the establishment of comprehensive standards, regulations and procedures governing the planning, design and construction or major construction of corridors within the City. The regulations found in this section attempt to balance the needs of all users of City streets and corridors including motorists, transit users, pedestrians and cyclists. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the streets of the City of La Crosse provide safe, convenient, and comfortable routes for walking, bicycling, and public transportation, encourage increased use of these modes of transportation, enable convenient travel as part of daily activities, improve the public welfare by addressing a wide array of health and environmental problems, and meet the needs of all users of the streets, including children, older adults, and people with disabilities. This section is further intended to provide a mechanism to combine the principles of complete streets and traffic calming with improving the stormwater quality and quantity problems that the City faces by incorporating stormwater considerations into each and every complete street or traffic calming activity where feasible. 
(b)  Focus areas. The City shall focus Green Complete Streets implementation in areas where the Green Complete Streets infrastructure is most immediately needed such as missing links in sidewalks, along transit routes and stops, areas where nonmotorized transportation modes are common or anticipated to become common, corridors which provide primary access to significant destinations such as parks, schools, commercial areas, or employment centers, and streets/intersections which have high pedestrian and/or bicycle crash rates. In addition to focus areas, all corridor projects shall be considered for Green Complete Streets. Green Complete Streets may be achieved through single projects or incrementally through a series of smaller improvements or maintenance activities over time. It is the Council's intent that all sources of transportation funding be drawn upon to implement Green Complete Streets. The City believes that maximum financial flexibility is important to implement Green Complete Streets principles. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Corridor means any right-of-way, public or private, including arterials, connectors, alleys, ways, lanes, and roadways by any other designation, as well as bridges, tunnels, and any other portions of the transportation network. 
    Green Complete Streets means streets that safely accommodate all users of the right-of-way, including pedestrians, people requiring mobility aids, bicyclists and drivers and passengers of transit vehicles, trucks, automobiles and motorcycles, while at the same time incorporating best management practices for addressing stormwater runoff. 
Examples of Green Complete Streets design features that contribute to a safe, convenient, or comfortable travel experience for users include, but are not limited to, incorporating a combination of treatments such as: sidewalks; shared use paths; bicycle facilities; automobile lanes; paved shoulders; street trees and landscaping; planting strips; curbs; accessible curb ramps; bulb outs; crosswalks; refuge islands; pedestrian and traffic signals, including countdown and accessible signals; signage; street furniture; bicycle parking facilities; public transportation stops and facilities; transit priority signalization; traffic calming devices such as rotary circles, traffic bumps, and surface treatments such as paving blocks, textured asphalt, and concrete; narrow vehicle lanes; raised medians; and dedicated transit lanes, as well as stormwater and native vegetation features such as curb cuts to vegetation and permeable pavements, and those features identified in the City of La Crosse Bicycle/Pedestrian Master Plan. 
    Project means the construction, reconstruction, retrofit, alteration, or repair of any corridor, including the planning, design, approval, and implementation processes, but does not include minor routine upkeep such as cleaning, sweeping, mowing, spot repair, or interim measures on detour routes. 
    Users means people of all ages and abilities that use corridors, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicle drivers, public transportation riders and drivers. 
(d)  Requirement of infrastructure ensuring safe travel. 
(1)  The City Engineer's Office, Board of Public Works and Department of Planning and Development shall make Green Complete Streets practices a routine part of everyday operations and shall approach every transportation project and program as an opportunity to improve public and private corridors and the transportation network for all user groups, and shall work in coordination with other departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to achieve Green Complete Streets. 
(2)  Every corridor project on public or private property shall incorporate Green Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable reasonable safe travel along and across the right-of-way for each category of use; provided, however, that such infrastructure may be excluded, upon written approval by the Board of Public Works where documentation and data indicate that: 
a.  Use by nonmotorized users is prohibited by law; 
b.  The cost would be excessively disproportionate (greater than 20 percent) to the need or probable future use over the long term (stormwater and facilities for nonmotorized users are weighted equally); 
c.  There is a demonstrable absence of current or future need; 
d.  Inclusion of such infrastructure would be unreasonable or inappropriate in light of the scope of the project, or because it would be contrary to public safety; 
e.  Loss of on-street parking shall not be considered a singular criterion for exclusion of a Green Complete Street Project; 
f.  Public transit facilities are not required on streets not serving as transit routes; 
g.  For repairs made pursuant to the pavement openings and restorations or to ordinary maintenance activities designed to keep assets in serviceable condition (e.g., mowing, cleaning, sweeping, spot repair and surface treatments such as chip seal, or interim measures on detour or haul routes; 
h.  Because freight is important to the basic economy of the City and has unique right-of-way needs to support that role, freight shall be the major priority on streets classified as truck routes. Green Complete Streets improvements that are consistent with freight mobility but also support other modes shall be considered on these streets. 
(3)  The City of La Crosse shall incorporate Green Complete Streets infrastructure into existing and future public and private streets to improve the safety and convenience of users, construct and enhance the transportation network for each category of users, and create employment. 
(4)  If the safety and convenience of users can be improved within the scope of pavement resurfacing, restriping, or signalization operations on public or private streets, such projects shall implement Green Complete Streets infrastructure to increase safety for users. 
(5)  Trainings in how to integrate, accommodate, and balance the needs of each category of users shall be provided for planners, civil and traffic engineers, project managers, plan reviewers, inspectors, and other personnel responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of streets. 
(e)  Data collection, standards, and public input. 
(1)  The City of La Crosse shall collect data measuring how well the streets of the City of La Crosse are serving each category of users. Data may include latent demand, existing levels of service for different modes of transport and users, collision statistics, bicycle and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, or others. 
(2)  The City of La Crosse shall put into place performance standards with measurable benchmarks reflecting the ability of users to travel in safety and comfort. Performance standards may include transportation mode shift, miles of new bicycle facilities or sidewalks, percentage of streets with tree canopy and low design speeds, public participation, or others. 
(3)  The City of La Crosse shall establish procedures to allow full public participation in policy decisions and transparency in individual determinations concerning the design and use of streets. 
(4)  The City of La Crosse shall incorporate Green Complete Streets principles into all appropriate plans, zoning and subdivision codes, laws, manuals, rules, regulations and programs as appropriate, including Confluence, the La Crosse Comprehensive Plan and the Bicycle/Pedestrian Master Plan, to integrate, accommodate, and balance the needs of all users on public and private streets.

Each person making such opening shall he held liable for all damages, including costs incurred by the City in defending any action brought against it for damages, as well as cost of any appeal, that may result from the neglect by such person or his employees of any necessary precaution against injury or damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind. 
(d)  In opening any street or sidewalk, or other public way, the paving materials, sand, gravel and earth or other material moved or penetrated and all surface monuments or hubs disturbed must be replaced as nearly as possible in their original condition or position and the same relation to the remainder as before. Any excavated material which in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, or his authorized representative, is not suitable for refilling shall be replaced with approved backfill material. All rubbish shall be immediately removed, leaving the street or sidewalk in perfect repair, the same to be so maintained for a period of three years. In backfilling the opening, material shall be placed in maximum 12 inch lifts with each lift thoroughly compacted by mechanical means, or other methods approved by the Director of Public Works, or his authorized representative. Backfill material shall be clean, free from rocks, broken concrete exceeding two inches in size, organic material, debris, or any frozen chunks. The compaction method shall be capable of compacting the backfill to 95 percent of standard Proctor density. Trench shall be back-sloped or sheathed and braced as required by the State rules, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or as may be necessary to protect life, property or the work. No timber, bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any trench. If a contractor backfills a trench without implementing adequate compaction methods the contractor shall be required to remove the backfill and reinstall it using proper compaction methods. Refusal by the contractor will result in the City performing the work at the cost of the excavation permit holder along with possible other penalties described by this Code. The City may elect to have the City make the pavement repair for any street or sidewalk opening, in which case the cost of making such repair and of maintaining for three years shall be charged to the person making the street opening.

After such permanent improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open, cut or excavate said street for a period of five years after the date of improvement or repaving unless in the opinion of the Board of Public Works an emergency exists which makes it absolutely essential that the permit be issued. 
(Code 1980, § 5.11(F)) 
Sec. 40-36. - Emergency excavations authorized. 
    In the event of an emergency, any person owning or controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or utility in or under any street and his agents or employees may take immediate proper emergency measures to remedy dangerous conditions for the protection of property, life, health, or safety without obtaining an excavation permit; provided that such person shall apply for an excavation permit not later than the end of the next succeeding business day and shall not make any permanent repairs without first obtaining an excavation permit hereunder.

(1)  Each dwelling or other building used for human habitation or other buildings where human beings are in need of water facilities, which is located upon or adjacent to any street in and along which public water mains have been laid, or which has reasonable access to public water main, shall be connected with an individual connection to the said water main; except that when a private well is in compliance with Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 312, the Wisconsin Well Code, is adequate and safe, this supply may be continued in operation until such time as it is in need of repair or replacement. 
(2)  The owner of a multiunit dwelling has the option of having a metered water supply to each unit from a single connection to the public water system. The owner, by selecting this option, is required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable the individual supply to each unit and also individual disconnection without affecting service to other units. Each meter and meter connection will be a separate water utility customer for the purpose of the filed rates, rules and regulations. 
(3)  No more than one building shall be supplied from each individual water service. 
a.  A domestic water service shall not be used as a supply for a fire protection system, nor shall a fire protection service be used for domestic purposes except where a four-inch or larger connection is made to the main for private fire protection service, such fire service line may be tapped with a smaller size branch line for general domestic service. Rates for said "combined service" are on file in the office of the La Crosse Water Utility. 
b.  The installation of any pipe, valve, or conduit in any manner connected with the municipal water system so as to result in connection of a private water supply, the sanitary sewer, storm sewer system to the water supply, or any other fluid or substance which might result in the introduction into the municipal water system of a foreign substance, is prohibited. 
(b)  Pipe. 
(1)  Size. The water service pipe shall be of sufficient size to furnish water to the property in the quantities and at the pressures required in Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 382. The minimum inside diameter of any service pipe shall be three-fourths-inch. 
(2)  Materials. The water service pipe from a main to any property shall be Type K copper, cast iron, ductile iron, or other materials approved by the Utility. Any materials used within bounds of, or beneath an area subject to easement for highway or street purposes or public rights-of-way shall be subject to acceptance by the Utility. 
(c)  Control valves. 
(1)  Location. 
a.  Domestic services shall include an approved valve at the main, a curb stop or valve between the property line and the street, and valves inside the building, one on the supply side and one on the building side of the meter.

c.  For any water service three inches or larger, one valve may service as the shutoff at the main and the curb stop or valve. 
(2)  Materials. Curb stop valves shall be an approved ground key stopcock or ball valve up to and including two-inch size. Over two inches shall be approved gate valve with nonrising stem and square head operating nut. Each curb stop or valve shall be protected by an approved cast iron curb box or valve box and the cover exposed and level with the sidewalk, curb or lawn. 
(d)  Connection to main. 
(1)  Size. Any connection to the main shall be of sufficient size to furnish water to the property in the quantities and at the pressures required in Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 382. All connectors shall be made with an approved corporation cock, service saddle, tapping water valve and sleeve or other approved connection depending on connection and main size. Only one tap or connection to the main will be permitted for each service pipe. 
(2)  Installation. 
a.  Where corporation cocks are used, they shall be inserted at an angle of 45 degrees with the top of the water main and where applicable, the service pipe at the connection shall be bent into a large "S" or gooseneck to provide flexibility. 
b.  No pipe or fittings that have been used for other purposes shall be used for distributing potable water. 
(e)  Placement and backfilling. 
(1)  Placement. The water service pipe shall be laid at right angles to the water main. No water service pipe and building sewer shall be placed less than eight feet apart horizontally, separated by undisturbed or compacted earth, except as permitted by conditions outlined in Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 382. The water service pipe shall be placed not less than seven feet below the surface of the ground. When conditions prevent installation to specified depth, the service shall be so protected as to prevent freezing. All water service pipes shall be located within extended property lines of the property served, or on street rights-of-way, or other public land, and so installed as not to interfere with other utility lines. 
(2)  Backfilling. In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe shall be protected against injury by carefully hand-tamping the earth fill to a depth of six inches. The earth fill shall be free from hard lumps, rocks, stones and other injurious material. Water services shall not be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock, gravel fill nor any other material which may cause injury to, or disintegration of, the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or insulation approved by the Water Utility. 
(f)  Inspection . No plumber shall cover or permit the covering of any water service line until the installation has been inspected and approved by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety or its duly authorized representative.

(g)  Where, because of some deficiency in the Utility's portion of the facilities and at the request of the Utility, a customer permits the water to flow to prevent freezing, the Utility shall adjust said customer's bill for the excess consumption which results. 
(Code 1980, § 4.07) 
Sec. 46-29. - Cost of water services. 
(a)  The original installation of service pipes, including all excavation, materials and the connecting of such service pipes with the main and all related street and public land replacement and repair shall be at the expense of the property owner. 
(b)  The expense of laying new service pipes from the main through the curb stop in advance of street construction or rehabilitation, or when ordered by the Board of Public Works, shall be charged to, and be made a lien upon the real estate to be served by the service pipe. The property owner shall pay for such service installation before a permit will be issued to extend such service pipe to a building or property. 
(c)  In case it is necessary to install a larger service to replace an existing service, the new service shall be installed at the expense of the property owner. 
(d)  Upon proper installation, inspection and approval, all services from the main through the curb stop become the property of the Water Utility and shall be maintained by the Water Utility. 
(e)  Where an existing service must be relaid from the main to the curb stop by the Water Utility because of its condition and the owner wants an increase in size of service pipe, he shall pay for all cost over and above the cost of replacing the original size of service. 
(f)  Anytime an existing service is relaid for the purpose of increasing its size and a new and larger tap is made to the main, all existing service pipes that are to be discontinued shall be disconnected and the main taps property plugged.

The amount of the connection fee per residential equivalent connection (REC) shall be set forth in the City's fee schedule established by resolution and adopted by the Common Council. The amount of the connection fee may be reviewed and updated by the Common Council from time to time to ensure that the fee reflects the amounts that the City has invested in its wastewater treatment infrastructure and the current demand patterns of customers. 
(b)  Basis for connection fee. The City owns and operates a wastewater treatment plant and interceptor sewers and lift stations with capacity to serve additional customers. The purpose of the connection fee is to recover from new customers the cost of the available excess capacity in the utility system that has been paid for by the City and past and current customers. The amount of the connection fee is based on the total current value of the wastewater treatment plant and interceptor assets, the average day wastewater flow capacity of the entire system, and the average wastewater flow per day of a typical residential customer in the City. 
(c)  Residential equivalent connections. A residential equivalent connection (REC) equals the estimated amount of wastewater discharged by a single-family home in the City on a daily basis. The connection fee for each new single-family home is based on 1.00 REC. The connection fee for other uses is based on the number of RECs assigned to the use. RECs are assigned to a new connection based on the estimated amount of average wastewater flow to be discharge by the new connection compared to that discharged by an average single-family household. A new connection shall never be assigned less than 1.00 REC. 
(d)  New connection. A new connection is a parcel or property that has not discharged wastewater to the City's Wastewater Treatment Facility within the 15 years immediately prior to the plumbing permit application date. An increase in average wastewater flow discharged by a current or previously served parcel or property is not a new connection. 
(e)  Payment of connection fee. The City Utility Manager shall determine the number of RECs applicable to a new connection in conjunction with the City's issuance of a plumbing permit and issue an invoice to the property owner for the new connection. The City shall collect the connection fee as a condition precedent to the issuance of the plumbing permit. The billing entity shall provide documentation of all new connections, collect this fee and provide payment to the Sanitary Sewer Utility for the prior year's connection fees no later than January 31 of each year. 
(f)  Appeal. A property owner of a new connection who disputes the determination of RECs applicable to such new connection may within 20 days following the date of the City's invoice described in subsection (d) above, file a written appeal with the City specifying the nature of the dispute. The appeal shall state the grounds upon which the property owner contends that the decision should be modified or reversed. No appeal may be considered by the City unless the appeal is timely filed, and the connection fee is paid in accordance with the terms of this section and the invoice. If an appeal is timely filed, the Utilities Manager shall review the initial determination within 20 days and determine whether to sustain or deny the appeal. The property owner may further appeal this decision to the Board of Public Works within 15 days of receipt of the Utilities Manager's decision on appeal. The Board of Public Works shall hear the appeal within 15 days after receipt of the appeal. The Board of Public Works may sustain, reverse or modify the determination. Any appeal not timely filed, failing to state the grounds upon which the property owner contends the decision should be modified or reversed, or failing to pay the disputed fee shall be summarily denied by the City. Chapter 68, Wis. Stat., shall not apply to this section. 
(g)  Enforcement. The penalty for failing to pay any connection fee is as provided for in section 46-71 and, in addition, termination of service or the right to use the Sanitary Sewer System of the City of La Crosse including equitable and injunctive relief.

Sec. 46-107. - Purpose. 
(a)  This division sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors of wastewater discharged into the City of La Crosse Wastewater collection and treatment system owned and operated by the City and enables the City to comply with applicable Local, State, Federal laws and General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The objectives of this division are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of deleterious materials into the wastewater collection system which will interfere with the operation of the sewage collection and treatment system. 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of excessive quantities of pollutants into the wastewater treatment system which do not receive adequate treatment through treatment processes and which will pass partially treated or untreated into the Mississippi River or diffuse into the atmosphere. 
(3)  To prevent the contamination of municipal wastewater sludge and to improve the opportunity to beneficially recycle the sludge in conformity with applicable agricultural landspreading regulations. 
(4)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants or materials into the sewer system that are damaging or potentially damaging to the Wastewater Collection Treatment System, or threaten the health or safety of wastewater workers. 
(5)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants or materials into the City's wastewater system which will cause the treatment plant to violate its WPDES discharge permit or be otherwise incompatible with the system. 
(b)  This division provides for the regulation of wastewater discharged into the City sewer system through the issuance of permits to certain users of the system and through enforcement activities consistent with the provisions of this division and applicable State and Federal law. In addition, this division provides for the establishment of fees for the equitable distribution of expenses resulting from the regulatory program established herein. 
(c)  The provisions of this division shall be applicable within the corporate limits of the City of La Crosse and to other governmental entities and users outside the corporate limits of the City of La Crosse who discharge wastewater into the City's Collection Treatment System or are bound, by contract, agreement or permit, as users of the La Crosse Wastewater Treatment System. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board of Public Works of the City of La Crosse shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this division. 
(Code 1980, § 6.11(A)) 
Sec. 46-108. - Enforcement, appeal, and penalties. 
(a)  Enforcement procedures. The Board and/or its authorized representative is authorized to enforce the requirements of this division. The Board shall establish a stepped enforcement procedure to provide enforcement response by the City to noncompliance with or violation of any provisions of this division. The enforcement procedures shall be given in an Enforcement Guidelines document to be implemented by the Board. The enforcement responses incorporated into such Enforcement Guidelines document are listed in order of severity as follows: 
(1)  Informal notice (IN). Informal notice shall be achieved through a telephone call, inspection visit, informal meeting, or letter. Using any of these methods, an authorized agent of the Board may discuss with the user the noncompliance and its timely correction. 
(2)  Notice of violation (NOV). A notice of violation will be issued by the Board or its authorized agent for noncompliance based on the criteria contained in this division, the user's discharge permit, and the enforcement guidelines. The NOV will state the specific nature of the violation and the applicable permit or ordinance section(s) violated. The NOV will require a response from the user within 15 days to establish the reasons for the noncompliance and to provide a written plan for the satisfactory and expeditious correction of the noncompliance. 
(3)  Compliance order (CO). The Wastewater Utility Superintendent or the Board will issue an administrative order based on the criteria contained in this division, the user's discharge permit, and the enforcement guidelines. Such CO may contain requirements and deadlines for specific action by the user, compliance schedules, or prohibit certain actions or discharges by the user. A CO may not require termination of sewer or water service, but may require elimination of a specific noncomplying discharge. 
(4)  Forfeitures. The Board may levy an administrative forfeiture against any person in violation of this division or in violation of a discharge permit issued by the City. The forfeiture shall be not less than $100.00 or more than $2,000.00 per offense. Each day of violation will be considered a separate offense. 
(5)  Show cause hearing (SCH). 
a.  The Board may order any user who is in violation of, or in noncompliance with, requirements of this division or the user's discharge permit, to show cause before the Board why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken or why sewer or water service should not be terminated. A notice will be served on the offending person specifying the time and place of the hearing to be held by the Board regarding the violation. The notice shall include the reason why the hearing is to be held, the proposed enforcement action, and direct the offending person to show cause before the Board why the further enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by certified mail at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a user. 
b.  The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take evidence, or may designate any of its members or any representative or employee of the wastewater treatment facility to: 
1.  Issue in the name of the Board notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involving such hearings. 
2.  Take the evidence. 
3.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence together with recommendations to the Board for actions thereon. 
c.  At any hearing pursuant to this division, testimony taken shall be under oath and recorded stenographically or by electronic recording. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges for reproduction. 
(6)  Legal action, monetary penalties (LA). 
a.  Any violation of the substantive provisions of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or a CO shall be considered a public nuisance. If any person discharges wastewater into the City of La Crosse wastewater system contrary to the substantive provisions of this division, a discharge permit, or a CO, the City Attorney, at the direction of the Board, shall commence an action for appropriate legal and equitable relief. 
b.  The Board may seek injunctive relief when, in the opinion of the Board, potential harm to the wastewater treatment system, public health or welfare, or the environment requires an injunction to ensure a prompt and appropriate action by a discharger. 
(7)  Termination of sewer and/or water service, permit revocation (TS). 
a.  Any user who violates the conditions of this division, any applicable State or Federal regulations, the user's wastewater discharge permit, or a compliance order, is subject to having its discharge permit revoked and wastewater treatment and/or water service terminated in accordance with the provisions of this division by the Board. 
b.  Depending on the significance and severity of the noncompliance/violation identified, the Board is not precluded from directly taking any enforcement step appropriate to the nature of the noncompliance, and thus need not proceed in a stepped fashion as provided above. 
c.  In determining the level of enforcement response to user noncompliance/violation, the Board's consideration may include, but is not limited to, the historical compliance of the user to permit requirements, adherence to previously established compliance schedules, the impacts of the noncompliance on the public health and welfare, environment, wastewater treatment system, City employees, wastewater treatment effluent or sludge, the frequency and degree of exceedance of discharge limits or permit requirements, cooperation of the discharger in determining compliance status, previous enforcement actions taken, and good faith efforts of the discharger to attain compliance. 
d.  The Board may suspend the wastewater treatment service or a wastewater discharge permit or cut off the sewer connection when such suspension or cut-off is necessary, in the opinion of the POTW, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which: 
1.  Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons; 
2.  Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the environment; 
3.  May cause or actually causes interference to the POTW; or 
4.  Causes the POTW to violate any condition of its WPDES or State discharge permit. 
e.  The POTW may reinstate the wastewater contribution permit or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. 
f.  In the event of a suspension or cut-off under this section, within 15 days the user shall submit a written report describing the event that caused the suspension and the measures taken to prevent any recurrence. 
(b)  Right to appeal. Any discharger or interested party shall have the right to request in writing within 15 calendar days an interpretation or ruling by the Board on any matter covered by this division and shall be entitled to a written reply within 15 days. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with a specific condition of a permit issued pursuant heretofore which enforcement action related to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending the user's receipt of a written reply. Further inquiries shall not stay enforcement proceedings. Appeal of a final judicial order entered pursuant to this division may be taken in accordance with local and State law. 
(c)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or City-issued wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division, shall upon conviction be punished by the imposition of a civil penalty of not more than $2,000.00. 
(d)  Emergency situations. Whenever in the judgment of the Board or its authorized agents it is determined that any emergency situation exists, the Board or its agent may issue orders for the immediate halt of any discharge or discharges causing or contributing to an emergency situation, whether or not the discharge is in compliance with this division and any applicable discharge permit. Upon resolution of any emergency situation, the Board shall rescind its halt discharge order and enforcement procedures contained herein shall prevail. 
(e)  Penalty, costs. Any person who is found to have violated an order of the Board, or who willfully or negligently fails to comply with any provision of this division or the orders, rules, permits, and regulations issued hereunder, shall be subject to the following additional penalties:

r.  Wastewater containing mass discharge quantities of a contaminant in excess of a permit limit. Such limit shall apply to normal production days and may be a daily maximum limit, an average limit (weekly, monthly, etc.) or both. Such mass based permit limits will be used only for a user discharging more than five percent of the total quantity of that contaminant entering the City Wastewater Treatment System, based on data for the most recent 12 months. Such a mass based limit may be a more restrictive limit than the concentration based limits given in subsection (a) of this section or provided by Federal categorical limits. 
(b)  Variance. Upon request of a user, the Board may approve a variance of the limits set forth in subsection (a) of this section, if the user demonstrates that a thorough examination of available waste treatment technologies has been undertaken and that the cost of achieving compliance with a standard or standards is prohibitive within the context of the mass amount of pollutants to be removed. In addition, a variance shall only be allowed after the Board has established that such variance will not adversely impact wastewater treatment operations, sludge disposal, or result in a discharge in excess of the limits established for the City in its WPDES permit. Furthermore, if the user is subject to Federal categorical limits, the variance granted shall be no less stringent than the limit or limits established by the Environmental Protection Agency for said categorical user. 
(c)  Other Federal, State, or local limits. In addition to the general prohibited discharge standards established in subsection (a) of this section, no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged or deposited any wastewaters or effluent which do not conform to the pretreatment standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Pretreatment limits shall minimally include applicable national categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing sources set out in 40 CFR, Subchapter N, Parts 401 through 471 inclusive. No wastewater, or effluent including domestic, commercial and industrial waste, shall contain any substance which is in violation of any State, Federal, or local pretreatment or other discharge standards. 
(1)  Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. All users (existing sources or new sources) who are subject to categorical standards shall meet the compliance deadlines as outlined in Federal or State regulations. 
(2)  Concentration and mass limits for categorical users. The control authority may, for ease of operation, convert mass limits to concentration limits. The applicable Federal or State regulations will apply. 
(d)  Pretreatment removal credits. The Board may adjust pretreatment requirements for sources discharging toxic pollutants into the treatment system in order to reflect the removal of such toxic pollutants through the wastewater treatment works processes, as authorized by section 307(b)(1) of the Act. The regulatory approval required to issue removal credits is subject to a number of conditions as follows: 
(1)  There must be demonstrated and documented consistent removal of a toxic pollutant or pollutants through a treatment process or processes. 
(2)  The effluent discharged from the publicly owned treatment works must not be in excess of the limitations or standards which would be applicable to the toxic pollutant or pollutants if said pollutants were directly discharged to a waterway without receiving treatment by a publicly owned treatment works. 
(3)  The removal of a toxic pollutant or pollutants by the publicly owned treatment works must not cause the treatment works to violate sludge use or disposal requirements established under Section 405 of the Clean Water Act. 
(4)  The publicly owned treatment works must have an approved pretreatment program. 
(5)  The granting of removal credits will not cause a violation of the City's WPDES permit limitations or conditions. At the discretion of the Board, the City may seek authorization to grant removal credits to those users subject to categorical standards.

(Code 1980, § 6.13(B)) 
Sec. 46-148. - Basis for service charge. 
    Sanitary sewer charges shall be billed quarterly. Said charges shall initially be based on the City-Wide Sewer User Charge Rate System, dated September 1990 by John A. Mayer Associates and shall be reviewed and updated from time to time using the same or similar methodology. The minimum quarterly billing shall be sufficient to pay the billing and customer related administration expenses. The unit price per volume shall be sufficient to pay the remaining annual cost of operation, debt service and maintenance, including any replacement fund, of the sewerage facilities. The rates in this division shall be reviewed not less than biennially. Such review shall be performed by the Sanitary Sewer Utility and the Common Council. Rates shall be adjusted, as required, to reflect actual number and size of users and actual costs. 
(Code 1980, § 6.13(C)) 
Sec. 46-149. - Sewer service charges. 
    A sewer service charge is hereby imposed upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or premises served by the public sewer and wastewater facilities or otherwise discharging sewage, including industrial wastes, into the public sewerage system.

(1)  Category A. Category A is defined as normal or domestic strength wastewater having organic concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) no greater than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/1) and suspended solids no greater than 300 milligrams per liter (mg/1). The sewer service charge for Category A wastewater will consist of the following: 
    Quarterly facilities charge established by resolution. 
    V.C. = C.V. x V. 
    V.C. = Total volumetric charge. 
    V. = Total volume of water used during billing period in units of 100 cubic feet (CCF). 
    C.V. = Volume unit price = Cost per 100 cubic feet, as established by resolution. 
(2)  Category B. Category B is defined as nondomestic strength wastewater having organic concentrations of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) greater than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/1) and/or suspended solids (SS) greater than 300 milligrams per liter (mg/1), based on average concentrations discharged to the Utility's sewer system during the billing period. The sewer service charge for Category B is as follows: 
    Quarterly Facilities Charge - Fixed charge, as established by resolution. 
    Volume Charge: as established by resolution. 
    S.S.C. = Total sewer service charge 
    S.S.C. = Category A charge (fixed plus volumetric) plus High Strength Surcharge 
    High Strength Surcharge = (C.B. x BOD) + (C.S. + SS) 
    C.B. = BOD Unit Price = Charge per pound, as established by resolution. 
    C.S. = SS Unit Price =, as established by resolution. 
    BOD = pounds of BOD discharged during billing period in excess of domestic strength wastewater. 
    SS = pounds of SS discharged during billing period in excess of domestic strength wastewater. 
(3)  Category C. Category C is tanker truck disposal. Charges are as follows: 
a.  Tanker Truck Disposal: Fixed Disposal Charge per Load, as established by resolution.

3.  Grease Trap Disposal** as established by resolution. 
Assumes waste pumped directly to Digesters 
(4)  Deduct meter. 
a.  Where a deduct meter is approved for measuring water not discharged to sanitary sewer, the user shall purchase such meter from the Utility, and shall be responsible for installing the meter in accordance with applicable codes. The Utility will be responsible for subsequent maintenance and replacement of such meters. The user shall be responsible for removal of in-place deduct meter and installation of replacement meters in accordance with applicable codes. 
b.  The quarterly fixed charge for deduct meters or segregated meters for meter reading, billing, meter maintenance, and ultimately, meter replacement, shall vary based upon the size of the meter and shall correspond to the quarterly fixed charged for similarly sized water meters. 
(5)  Contract users. All persons, entities, municipalities, public bodies or others receiving treatment of sanitary sewage pursuant to a contract with the City shall pay charges in accordance with the contract. 
(6)  Reassignment of sewer users. The Sanitary Sewer Utility will reassign sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary. 
(Code 1980, § 6.13(D)) 
Sec. 46-150. - Sampling and testing. 
(a)  Flow proportional 24-hour composite samples collected during a period representing typical discharge conditions shall be used to determine BOD and SS concentrations. Not less than one sample per billing period shall be taken and analyzed. The collection, preservation, and analysis of samples shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 136 and any amendments thereto, or other such methods approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
(b)  Data provided to the Utility under an industrial pretreatment discharge permit is acceptable for this purpose. The results of any samples taken and analyzed with approved methods shall be reported to the utility within 30 days of the date the user received analysis results. 
(c)  The Sewer Utility may sample and test the discharge from any user suspected of having nonnormal domestic strength wastewater. If this testing indicates the wastewater exceeds maximum domestic strength concentrations, the user will be required to sample and analyze their wastewater for BOD and SS at least once every three-month billing period. The Utility may require more frequent sampling if, in the opinion of the Utility, the variability of the BOD and/or SS concentrations, or the magnitude of the surcharge warrants. The Utility may require the user to install a sampling manhole if there is not another suitable location to obtain a representative sample. 
(d)  The user will be responsible for all sampling and analysis costs, except the Utility will be responsible for the initial sampling and analysis in cases where there is not data available to determine if a user discharges wastewater exceeding normal domestic strength concentrations.

(1)  Acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, manage, and finance such facilities and equipment as are deemed by the City to be proper and necessary for stormwater and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation, due to enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, pollution control practices, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls, ponds, streets, roads, ditches, and such other natural or manmade facilities as will support a stormwater management system. 
(2)  Undertake any operations or activities, or provide any services deemed by the City to be proper and necessary for stormwater and surface water management. 
(3)  Maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements for stormwater and surface water management. 
(Code 1980, § 23.02) 
Sec. 46-175. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City Billing Policy means a written document prepared by the Director and approved by the Board of Public Works that sets forth the methods and criteria under which customers are billed for stormwater charges. The City Billing Policy shall be available through the Department of Public Works prior to the initial billing. 
    City Credit Policy means a written document prepared by the Director and approved by the Board of Public Works that sets forth the methods and criteria under which customers may obtain credit to reduce stormwater charges. The City Credit Policy shall be available through the Department of Public Works prior to the initial billing. 
    Customer means the owner or non-owner user of a property with impervious area in the City. 
    Developed property means property that is developed by the addition of an improvement such as a building, structure, grading, other impervious surface, or substantial landscaping, but excluding publicly owned rights-of-way. A new improvement shall be considered complete, upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or if no such certificate is issued, upon substantial completion of construction or final inspection. A new improvement shall also be considered complete if the construction project is at least 50 percent complete and then is halted for a period of three months or more, whether consecutive or not. 
    Director means the Director of Public Works. 
    Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the basic unit from which a storm sewer charge is calculated under this division. An ERU is equal to 2841 square feet of impervious surface, which is based upon the statistical average impervious area of a residential housing unit within the City as determined in the report "Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study Report City of La Crosse, WI," dated August 2009. This definition applies only to this division, and not to any other City of La Crosse ordinance. 
    Impervious area or impervious surface means a surface that has been compacted or covered with a layer of material so that it is highly resistant to infiltration by rainwater. It includes, but is not limited to, streets, roofs, sidewalks, parking lots, compacted gravel surfaces, as well as other similar surfaces; all as measured on a horizontal plane. 
    Nonresidential property means any developed property not defined as "residential property," including, but not limited to, transient rentals (such as hotels and motels), multifamily apartment buildings or condominiums of four or more dwelling units, commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental property, and parking lots. 
    Owner means each and every property owner and includes, but is not limited to, natural persons, partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, joint ventures, and all other legal entities of whatever kind or nature. 
    Residential property means any property developed exclusively for residential purposes with three or fewer residential housing units. 
    Storm event. A ten-year storm event is defined as 4.4 inches of liquid precipitation falling in a 24-hour period using a SCS Type II distribution curve as established in the "United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Technical Paper 149, published 1973." Statistically, a ten-year storm has a ten percent chance of occurring in any given year. 
    Stormwater means water that originates during a precipitation event. It may also be used to apply to water that originates with snowmelt. Stormwater that does not soak into the ground becomes surface runoff. Stormwater is of concern for two main issues, one related to volume and timing of runoff (water quantity) and the other related to potential contaminants that the water is carrying, i.e., water pollution (water quality). 
    Stormwater quality. The terms "water quality" and the "assessment of water quality" refer to total suspended solids and phosphorus. The analysis of water quality shall be performed using a pollutant loading analysis model such as SLAMM, P8, or equivalent methodology as approved by the Director. 
    Stormwater quantity. The term "water quantity" refers to the total volume and peak flow rate of stormwater run-off. 
    Stormwater Utility or Utility means the City-owned and operated utility established under this division for the purpose of managing stormwater and imposing charges for the recovery of costs connected with such stormwater management.

The annual rate per ERU shall be established pursuant to further resolution of the Common Council and shall be fair and reasonable. A schedule of current rates shall be maintained and on file in the office of the City Clerk. 
(1)  All developed property with impervious area shall be assigned ERUs. Each residential property shall be assigned one ERU. The number of ERUs assigned to nonresidential property shall be determined by the Director based upon the nonresidential property's actual impervious area (in square feet) divided by 2,841 (carried out to the nearest 0.1). 
(2)  The Director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the City Assessor, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant, or developer. The billing amount shall be updated by the Director based on any additions or reductions to the impervious area. Individual property owners may submit site and building surveys to the Director that help more accurately determine the total area and impervious area. 
(3)  All unoccupied developed lots and parcels with impervious surfaces shall be subject to a stormwater utility charge. 
(4)  The minimum charges for any parcel shall be equal to the rate for 0.4 ERU, unless it contains no impervious surface. 
(5)  In the event the owner and non-owner users of a particular property are not the same, the liability for the charges attributable to that property shall be joint and several. 
(6)  This division shall sunset after 20 years from the date it is enacted, provided the City's storm sewer system has the capacity to safely transport the quantity of water produced in a ten-year storm event and the City's total water quality loading has been reduced by 40 percent from the "no controls" load determined in the report "Stormwater Utility Feasibility Study Report City of La Crosse, WI," dated August 2009.

The pilot flame shall be in such a position that in the event of a drop in gas pressure, the contact between the pilot flame and flame rod or scanner shall be broken before the point where the pilot light will fail to reliably ignite the main burner. 
c.  The control system used in conjunction with the electronic safety pilot shall be of a type to lock out the main flame in approximately five seconds or less, and shall require a manual re-set operation before flame can be re-established. All safety pilots shall be equipped with positive closing automatic gas valves, and shall close in the event of an indicated flame failure. 
d.  Forced or induced draft equipment and natural draft type burners with supplementary air fans with modulating or closing air shutters with an input in excess of 1,000,000 BTU per hour shall be so arranged that a prepurge period of approximately 30 seconds is obtained. This prepurge shall occur before establishing ignition on intermittent or interrupted pilots, and before establishing main flame or continuously proved pilots. 
e.  Where a switch is installed in the low-water cut-off circuit to keep the circuit to the safety shut-off valve closed when blowing down water column, the switch must be of the push button type, so that when operator releases button, the control circuit to safety shut-off valve will be normal. 
f.  All pilot burners shall be supported in such a manner that their position relative to the main burner or burners will remain fixed. 
g.  Pilot lines shall be connected to vertical supply lines when possible. When horizontal line is used, connection must be made on top or side. Connection must be ahead of all controls, (except pressure regulator on medium and high pressure) and main shut-off valve, and shall be provided with separate shut-off cock. Where gas pressure is greater than that for which pilots are designed, a pressure regulator (pilot regulator) must be installed on the downstream side of pilot line shut-off cock. 
h.  Safety shut-off valves shall be tested to assure gas tightness of the seat when in a closed position; the valve assembly shall be gastight in all positions. Packing glands shall be designed so that the valve will not be made inoperative by excessive tightening of the packing nut. 
(9)  Venting of controls. Pressure regulators, slow opening gas valves and other gas equipment requiring venting shall be vented to a safe point outside the building, or to a point in the breeching or stack, where the volume of flow of air is such that a combustible mixture cannot be obtained. 
(10)  Draft controls. 
a.  Approved draft controls are to be used on all equipment, except when forced and induced draft is used in conjunction with controls that modulate the forced or induced draft in the direct ratio with the fuel modulation, and shall be used with forced or induced draft modulating systems when they are attached to a stack which may disturb fuel air ratio due to its draft intensity to the equipment. 
b.  Barometric draft controls. These draft controls are to be of the "gas" type control, free to swing both ways. Barometric type draft controls shall have a cross sectional area equal to approximately 75 percent of the cross sectional area of the breaching from equipment which they are regulating. 
c.  Mechanical draft controls. This type of control may use hydraulic pressure, steam, air, or electricity as an actuating medium, and shall be so arranged that they will program to the open position before ignition is established on interrupted or intermittent piloted equipment, and before main flame is established on constantly proved pilot equipment, and shall be equipped with a positive means of delaying the equipment before the open position is obtained. 
(11)  Dual fuel equipment. 
a.  All dual fuel equipment, using gas as one of the fuels, must comply with the requirements of this section, in controlling the gas equipment, and shall be so arranged that no adjustments are changed or required when changing fuels. Dual fuel equipment shall be equipped with an on-off-on type of transfer switch that will not pass through the center off position without stopping in the off position. 
b.  When atmospheric inshot gas burners are used for over stoker dual fuel operation, two automatic draft sensing controls shall be installed to insure a preset draft for each fuel. These two automatic draft sensing controls shall be electrically connected with the control systems so that each draft sensing control will be electrically interlocked with its respective fuel. 
c.  Inshot type gas burners installed for dual fuel operation shall be equipped with a sliding protective refractory slab that can be easily positioned in front of the gas burner firing nozzles when the other fuel is being used. The sliding protective refractory slab shall be interlocked electrically with the control system so as to prohibit accidental operation of the gas burner when the protective slab is positioned for other fuel operation. 
Note: The protective slab may be omitted when using power gas burners installed for dual fuel operation provided continuous fan operation is maintained while the gas burner is on standby. 
(12)  Inspection and tests . All installations shall be carefully tested for the proper operation of all controls and electrical circuits. Upon completion of fire testing and adjusting, a complete test report shall be filed with the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety in accordance with forms supplied by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. Piping shall be carefully tested for leaks. 
(13)  Industrial applications . On certain industrial and process applications, where certain parts of these regulations cannot be met as required, individual approval must be obtained from the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety, before a permit will be issued, or installation can be made. 
(14)  Air intakes. Gas burning equipment in buildings where adequate air for combustion is not assured, shall have fresh air intakes of the permanently open type, or with closeable dampers. Air intakes with closeable or automatic type dampers that program with the equipment shall be equipped with a positive lockout device to prevent operation of the equipment unless the damper is open to a predetermined position.

ARTICLE VII. - VACANT BUILDING REGISTRATION PROGRAM (VBRP) 

Sec. 103-363. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Building means any structure used or built for the shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, chattels, or movable property of any kind; and when separated by a fire-wall, each portion of such building so separated shall be deemed a separate building. A boathouse shall be considered a building. 
    Dwelling means any building which is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living or sleeping purposes by human occupants. 
    Evidence of vacant property means any condition that on its own or combined with other conditions would lead a reasonable person to believe the property is vacant. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, overgrown and/or dead vegetation, accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail, past due utility notices, disconnected utilities, accumulation of trash, junk and/or debris, broken or boarded windows, abandoned vehicles, auto parts or materials, the absence of window coverings such as curtains, blinds and/or shutters, the absence of furnishings and/or personal items consistent with habitation, or occupation, statements by neighbors, passerby, delivery agents or governmental employees that the property is vacant. 
    Foreclosure means the process by which a mortgage is enforced against a parcel of real property through sale or offering for sale to satisfy the debt of the mortgagee. 
    Mortgage means a recorded lien or interest in real property to secure payment of a loan. 
    Mortgagee means a person, firm, corporation or other legal entity holding a mortgage on a property. 
    Mortgagor means a borrower under a mortgage who grants a lien or interest in property to a mortgagee as security for the payment of a debt. 
    Owner means any individual, limited liability company member, co-partnership, association, corporation, company, fiduciary, or any other person or legal entity having a legal or equitable title or interest in real property. The term includes a mortgagee which has obtained a judgment of foreclosure against a property. 
    Structure means a combination of material to form a construction that is safe and stable; including among others, buildings, stadiums, reviewing stands, platforms, staging observation towers, radio towers, water tanks and towers, trestles, piers, wharves, sheds, coal bins, shelters, fences and display signs; the term structure shall be construed as if followed by the words "or part thereof." 
(Code 1980, § 8.01(L)(2)) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction, § 1-2. 
Sec. 103-364. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of this article is to prevent the blighting influence and nuisances caused by residential and commercial structures that are condemned, abandoned, or vacant and to ensure the integrity of our community's health, safety, welfare, and value. 
(b)  Properties that are condemned, abandoned, or vacant act as blighting influence for the surrounding neighborhood, depress market values of surrounding properties to the detriment of the various taxing districts and require additional governmental services. The use and maintenance of property in such condition and manner endangers the public safety and health, constitutes an unreasonable use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort and repose of a considerable number of the public, is detrimental to the public good and to the common welfare. 
(c)  Unsecured properties are a harborage for rodents; an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and criminals as a temporary abode; have very high probability of intentionally-set fires, an increased risk of explosion due to the theft of internal piping. Unkempt grounds surrounding such properties invite dumping of garbage and rubbish thereon. Therefore, adequate protection of public health, safety and welfare, requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions may be abated. 
(d)  It is important for the community to know which buildings are vacant or have a higher potential for abandonment so as to establish a proactive approach to track properties that are at risk of becoming vacant while the owner is still known. This type of action reduces the cost to the community and places the responsibility for rehabilitation on the property or proper security on the owner early in the cycle of deterioration.

The Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety and City Engineer shall not approve plans nor shall the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety issue permits required by this article for land disturbing activities unless said plans are in accordance with established specifications, including, but not limited to the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook. 
(c)  Standard for tracking . For plan approval and issuance of a permit, there must be adequate provision to prevent the tracking or dropping of dirt or other materials from the site onto any public or private street. 
(d)  Design criteria, engineering standards and general principles . All control measures required to comply with this article shall meet the most recent design criteria, standards and specifications contained within the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook. The applicant for a permit may employ other control measures if they will accomplish the objectives of this article and are approved by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety and City Engineer. The following general principles shall be used by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety and City Engineer when evaluating erosion control plans and granting permits under this article: 
(1)  Erosion control plans shall incorporate best management practices to reduce soil loss during construction. 
(2)  No large scale excavation with the exception of water and sewer lines, shall be made where the excavation shall leave the site devoid of cover vegetation after November 15. All disturbed area not seeded by September 15 of each year shall be sodded, or controlled by the use of erosion matting or other approved method. Dormant seeding may not be used on slopes greater than six percent or adjacent to streams, lakes or channels. Dormant seeding requires additional seeding in the spring. All restoration of topsoil and/or revegetation must be completed by September 15 in order that the seeding is effective before winter. The City Engineer and the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall have the authority to waive revegetation requirements in no set circumstances in which they determine that revegetation is not necessary to meet the purposes of this article. If it is determined that delays have occurred due to an act of God and topsoil spreading and revegetation is impossible, then the contractor/developer is required to take appropriate action to eliminate erosion while the site remains uncovered. 
(3)  Temporary vegetation, mulching or other cover shall be used to protect critical areas, and permanent vegetation shall be installed as soon as practical. 
(4)  Sod shall be laid in strips at those intervals necessary to prevent erosion and at right angles to the direction of drainage. 
(5)  Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected to the extent practicable and shall be deemed a dominant factor in developing the site. 
(6)  Sediment basins (where required) shall be constructed and maintained to trap and remove and prevent sediment and debris from being washed outside the area of land disturbance. Basins shall be designed and constructed for a ten-year, 24-hour storm (4.3 inches) in accordance with accepted design standards, as approved by the City Engineer. Sediment basins intended to serve additional functions such as runoff volume control shall be subject to additional requirements and standards elsewhere in City codes, as applicable. Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the applicant until such time that the basin is transferred to and accepted by the City or homeowners association in writing. The sediment basins shall be readily accessible, via easement or dedicated access, for ease of maintenance if dedicated to the City. 
(7)  Each site shall have roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to minimize sediment tracking onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning, not flushing, before the end of each workday. 
(8)  All storm drain inlets shall be protected with straw bales, filter fabric, or equivalent barriers upon completion of the inlet and until the site has been stabilized. 
(9)  Site erosion control shall be attained by the following: 
a.  All site developments and land disturbance activities shall be planned and implemented to best fit the terrain, minimize exposed area, retain as much existing vegetation as possible. 
b.  With the exception of those areas identified in the control plan, all disturbed ground not established to final grade within 14 days of the initial land disturbance, or left inactive for 14 days shall be stabilized by temporary or permanent seeding, sodding or equivalent control measures. Seeding should be completed within 24 hours of final grading. In areas determined to be environmentally sensitive because of steep slope, authority is granted to require immediate revegetation and erosion control measures. If temporary seeding is used, a permanent cover shall also be used as part of final site stabilization. 
c.  Runoff from areas adjacent to the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas where possible. 
d.  All land disturbance activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence in accordance with the control plan to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at one time. 
e.  Cuts and fills shall be planned and constructed to minimize the length and steepness of slopes. 
f.  Channels and other concentrated flow areas shall be properly designed and constructed to control runoff within and from the site in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channel. 
g.  Sediment shall be contained on-site through the use of filter fabric fences, straw bale fences, sediment basins, or other methods approved by acceptance of the erosion control plan by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. 
h.  Earth storage piles should be located no closer than 25 feet from drainage channels or roadways and no closer than 100 feet from perennial waters or wetlands. 
i.  Earth storage piles located closer than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel or located closer than 100 feet to perennial waters and wetlands shall require silt fences or other suitable means if left more than five days. Earth storage piles located on slopes of 12 percent or greater shall meet the requirements of subsection (d)(9)b of this section or runoff shall be contained within a silt fence or other approved measure. 
(10)  Areas with natural existing slope at or greater than 30 percent are restricted development areas. No land disturbance activities shall occur within ten feet of these areas except for access roads or installation of utilities to building sites of less than 30 percent slope, or where slopes 30 percent or greater are less than 4,000 noncontiguous square feet in area. If encroachment into a restricted development area occurs for any of the exceptions indicated, adequate erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practical. These areas shall be stabilized and not remain exposed without adequate erosion control measures in place. 
To preserve restricted development areas, a ten-foot offset line shall be established from where the slope becomes 30 percent. The lot owner or developer shall have the ten-foot offset slope line staked at the site to adequately indicate the restricted areas. No land shall be disturbed or permits issued until these slope stakes are verified for accuracy by the City. Slope stakes shall remain until all disturbed areas on the lot or plat have been permanently stabilized. 
(e)  Construction standards . All work performed under this article shall comply with the applicable sections of the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook.

Sec. 109-5. - Findings of fact. 
    Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the City would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare, and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
(Code 1980, § 15.36(A)(2)) 
Sec. 109-6. - Purpose. 
    To promote the public health, safety and convenience, and general welfare, this chapter has been established to: 
(1)  Maintain the flood and stormwater capacity of wetlands; 
(2)  Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(3)  Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life, and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
(4)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
(5)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling, and other earth moving activities. 
(Code 1980, § 15.36(A)(3)) 
Sec. 109-7. - Compliance. 
(a)  The use of wetlands, and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the City, shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, State, or Federal regulations. (However, see section 109-20 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a land use and/or building permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
(b)  Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stat. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stat. § 30.2022 applies.

Sec. 109-8. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stat. § 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(Code 1980, § 15.36(B)(3)) 
Sec. 109-9. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117 and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.

(1)  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Department publication Surface Water Resources of La Crosse County or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter in section 109-32. 
(2)  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in section 109-32 shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(3)  Setbacks for building construction or land disturbances from all wetlands depicted on the Wetland Inventory Map shall be 50 feet. 
(4)  The Wisconsin Wetland Inventory shows only the general location of wetlands. Precise delineation shall be made by the applicant for a land disturbance permit or approval of a development plan through the performance of a full field survey applying the standards of the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual. All permit applications for development in a Wetlands (W) District or on a tract containing or abutting a Wetlands (W) District shall be accompanied by a scaled drawing showing the wetland boundary. The applicant shall submit evidence documenting the results of the delineation and may make adjustments to it. The Zoning Administrator may waive the delineation requirement if the Administrator determines that a development will have no adverse impact. 
(5)  a.  There shall be a shoreland setback area of at least 50 feet from the ordinary high-water mark, except as provided in subsection b. 
b.  A provision authorizing construction or placement of a principal building within the shoreland setback area established under subsection a. if all of the following apply: 
1.  The principal building is constructed or placed on a lot or parcel of land that is immediately adjacent on each side to a lot or parcel of land containing a principal building. 
2.  The principal building is constructed or placed within a distance equal to the average setback of the principal building on the adjacent lots or 35 feet from the ordinary high-water mark, whichever distance is greater. 
(b)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. When questions arise, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(c)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error. If the Department staff concur with Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall be responsible for initiating a shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

(Code 1980, § 20.25(A)(1))

Signs may be erected, placed, established, painted, created or maintained only in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1980, § 20.25(A)(2))

(Code 1980, § 20.25(A)(3)) 
Sec. 111-6. - Computations and measurements. 
(a)  Sign area of individual signs . 
Sign Height 

The area of a sign face or element (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral section of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such supporting device otherwise meets the regulations of this chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself. The cumulative area of all sign elements of a sign structure shall constitute the total square footage. Appendages on the sign structure shall be measured by using the smallest rectangle encompassing the sign. In the event that a sign is shaped like an oval, circle, or triangle, the sign shall be measured based on its actual area, rather than measuring the area of the rectangle surrounding the sign. Irregular shaped signs that are not ovals, circles, or triangles shall be measured using the aforementioned rectangle method of measurement. The cumulative total of individual sign faces or elements; shall constitute the square footage of the sign structure. 
Sign Area Measurement (1) 

(b)  Area of double-faced and multiple-faced signs . Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 90 degrees or less, only one display face shall be counted in computing the sign area. If the two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the larger sign face shall be counted as the sign's area. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. 
Multifaced Signs 

(c)  Height . The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to the highest point of the sign or sign structure, measured from the base of the sign at normal grade. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: existing grade prior to construction; or newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined or where the normal grade is below the grade at street level, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street. 
Computed Height 

(d)  Measuring distance . Unless a different method of measurement is described in this chapter, distance shall be measured by commencing at the lot line where the sign is located and extending the radius and radii outward, excluding distances over public right-of-way. 
(Code 1980, § 20.25(C), (P)) 
Sec. 111-7. - Signs exempt from regulation.

    No person shall prevent, resist or interfere with any of the officers or employees of the City in the entering of any premises or the carrying out of their duties. 
(Code 1980, § 20.35(A)) 
Sec. 111-9. - Sign erector's license and insurance.

Sec. 111-10. - Substitution. 
    Subject to the property owner's consent, noncommercial speech of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial speech; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any provision to the contrary in this Code. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a lot or parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted. The term "commercial speech" means any sign, wording, logo, or other representation advertising a business, profession, commodity, goods, services or entertainment for business purposes. The term "noncommercial speech" means any message that is not commercial speech, including, without limitation, messages concerning political, religious, social, ideological, public service, and information topics.

(3)  Except for allowable temporary signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this chapter, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be attached to the ground, a building or another structure by direct attachment to a wall, frame or structure. All sign supports shall be painted or stained so as to be consistent with the appearance of the sign. 
(b)  Maintenance . All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all applicable building and electrical codes and provisions of this chapter. Specifically: 
(1)  If the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety finds that any sign, awning, banner, billboard, flag, pennant, streamer, or any part of any such sign or derivative thereof is unsafe, insecure, dilapidated, out of repair or abandoned, or is in such poor condition that it is dangerous or a blighting influence upon the neighboring properties, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall issue written notice to the owner of the property upon which the sign exists to cause the sign to be repaired or removed in its entirety. 
a.  Such written notice shall prescribe a period of time for compliance of not less than ten calendar days and not to exceed 90 calendar days except as set forth in subsection (b)(1)d of this section. 
b.  Such written notice shall be presumed served personally upon the owner of the property when it is mailed via regular U.S. Mail to the last known address of the property owner as it appears in the City Tax Assessor's files at the time the written notice is mailed. 
c.  In the event that the owner of the property upon which the sign exists does not comply with such written notice, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall cause such sign or any part of such sign to be removed, the cost of which may be charged against the real estate upon which the sign is located as described in subsection (b)(1)d of this section.

ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 111-34. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Definition. A nonconforming sign is a sign that was legally established but which no longer complies with the sign regulations of this chapter. 
(b)  Expansion . A nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged, expanded, converted to an electronic message unit sign or otherwise improved except for the purpose of normal maintenance (example: repainting, relamping, or replacing faces). 
(c)  Moving. A nonconforming sign shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other location unless the move results in the entire sign being brought into compliance with all applicable regulations of this chapter. 
(d)  Loss of nonconforming status . 
(1)  If a sign is destroyed by any means by more than 50 percent of its value it shall not be reestablished except in compliance with all applicable regulations of this chapter. 
(2)  In the case of a retailer who sells the product of a manufacturer or supplier under an agreement or franchise, if the manufacturer or supplier requires changes to the on-premises sign, such changes are allowed and will not affect the nonconforming status of any other on-premises signs, although, the replacement signs must comply in all other respects with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  No new sign structures may be added, and the sign must not be larger than the previously existing sign. 
(Code 1980, § 20.25(L)) 
Sec. 111-35. - Uniform Sign Plans; optional sign review procedure. 
(a)  Applicability. Property owners have the option of obtaining sign permits for more than one sign at one location or for multitenant buildings using the Uniform Sign Plan review and approval process. Once the Uniform Sign Plan process has been initiated, no ground, wall, awning, or projecting signs shall be erected until a Uniform Sign Plan has been approved in accordance with this section. The optional Uniform Sign Plan approval process shall only apply to ground, wall, awning, or projecting signs. 
(b)  Elements. The Uniform Sign Plan shall consist of four elements that shall govern all signs within the development: 
(1)  Location; 
(2)  Materials; 
(3)  Size; and 
(4)  Illumination. 
The Uniform Sign Plan shall include details, specifications, dimensions, and plans showing the proposed locations of signs and how such locations comply with the requirements of this chapter. It shall also show the computations of the maximum total sign area for all ground and wall signs allowed for the site. 
(c)  Allocation of wall sign space. A Uniform Sign Plan should show the allocation of allowed wall sign space among tenants and any general building sign or signs. Where the Uniform Sign Plan does not show such an allocation, the City may issue permits for wall signs for tenant entrances, in accordance with this chapter, in proportion to the frontage such tenant controls on the applicable wall, and the City shall cease to issue permits for wall signs when all available wall sign area has been committed through permits. 
(d)  Review . The Uniform Sign Plan shall be subject to approval by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. An expedited review process provides for Uniform Sign Plan approval within seven calendar days excluding holidays and the permit fees will be 50 percent the cost of the normal sign permit fee. 
(e)  Approval criteria . A Uniform Sign Plan shall not be approved until the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety finds that: 
(1)  The plan provides that signs of a similar type and function within the development will have a consistent size, lettering style, and material construction; and 
(2)  The plan provides for signs that meet the size limitations, location requirements and other applicable requirements of this chapter. 
(f)  Amendments . A Uniform Sign Plan may be amended by filing a new Uniform Sign Plan with the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety. 
(1)  The application may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by the proposed change; or an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser authorized by the owner to file such application. Before filing the application, all landowners affected by the proposed change must give written authorization. 
(2)  Any new or amended Uniform Sign Plan (including those for planned unit developments) shall include a schedule for bringing into conformance, within 90 days, all signs not conforming to the proposed plan. 
(3)  Under the Uniform Sign Plan, one additional wall sign may be permitted provided such additional sign faces a street or parking lot and further provided that such additional sign is a substitute for the permitted monument sign. In no case shall such additional wall signage exceed 225 square feet or 20 percent of the wall area, whichever is greater. 
(g)  Effect of approval; Uniform Sign Plan . All owners, tenants, subtenants and purchasers of individual units within the development shall comply with the approved Uniform Sign Plan. After approval of a Uniform Sign Plan, or an amended Uniform Sign Plan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in accordance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this chapter. In case of any conflict between a provision of a Uniform Sign Plan and one or more provisions of this chapter, this chapter shall control.

(2)  Fees for permits, licenses and other services related to signs shall be in the amount established by resolution. Any person not filing or submitting the application for any permit or license provided for under this chapter in a timely manner may have the license processed if the applicant pays an amount totaling twice the amount of the regular fee that would be paid for such application. This provision shall not apply should there be insufficient time to process the application as determined by the appropriate processing City officials. 
(b)  Permits to be consistent with this chapter. No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign unless such sign is consistent with:

(c)  Application requirements. 
(1)  An application for a sign permit may be filed only by the owner of the property on which the sign is to be erected, or by an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser specifically authorized by the owner to file such application.

In case of a rejection, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall identify those sections of this chapter with which the sign is inconsistent. 
(e)  Lapse of approval/inspections. 
(1)  If an approved sign has not been erected or put in place within six months of the issuance of the sign permit, the sign permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. 
(2)  The applicant shall request that the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety inspect the sign at or before the end of the six month period following issuance of the sign permit. If, upon inspection, the construction is found to be substantially complete but not in full compliance with this chapter, the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall give the property owner or tenant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the sign permit shall lapse and the sign shall be removed immediately. The failure to remove signs for which permits have lapsed shall be unlawful. 
(3)  A sign permit shall lapse and be of no further effect if the business is discontinued for a period of at least 90 days. The Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety shall order the sign removed within 30 days.

(3)  Existing electronic message unit signs already permitted in the City, but no longer conforming with this chapter, shall be nonconforming signs. The following standards contained in Table 111-78 shall come into conformance with this chapter within 15 years of November 18, 2012, provided that the Common Council has authorized payment of just compensation and the City has remitted such just compensation to the owners of such signs: height, maximum percentage of monument sign, overall maximum size, distance from residential zoning district, spacing between signs, spacing from other uses, setbacks from property lines, portable (commander board, delivery trucks, semi-trailers, cabinet on vehicles or trailers). All such signs may remain in place beyond the above date until said just compensation has been authorized and paid. The owners of such signs shall not increase, add to, alter, or enhance the value of such signs except for routine and required customary maintenance. The measure of just compensation for removal of signs under this section shall be as set forth under Wis. Stat. 84.30(7). Since the owners of all signs required to be removed under this subsection are provided a 15-year amortization period with just compensation, it is expected that existing sign leases will not be extended after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived beyond the period of payment of just compensation. The remaining standards contained in Table 111-78 shall come into conformance on April 20, 2014: illumination standards, hours of operation/use, dwell time, operating modes for transitions, interactivity, light trespass and nonconforming EMUs.

All of the standards in subsection (b) of this section apply and longer dwell time limits may be established as part of the conditional use permit, spacing may be reduced. However, all other standards shall remain the same. 
(5)  In recognition that electronic message unit signs are not permitted elsewhere in the downtown area except in the Arts District by conditional use permit and that arts venues are being given latitude for such signs, the City may impose additional conditions to regulate their use. A marquee sign (may consist of two sign faces for a V-shaped sign) or one flat wall sign may be permitted in the Arts District for venues dedicated to visual or performance arts and may overhang a sidewalk with a street privilege permit. This does not include bars or restaurants where live entertainment is occasionally performed. Additional conditions or special conditions may be required including but not limited to items such as longer hold times or architectural/artistic enhancements under this section. For monument signs, pedestrian scale signage appropriate to the surroundings and special conditions may also be applied. All EMUs must obtain approval of the City's Design Review Committee. There shall not be more than one electronic sign per parcel or arts venue. The City shall not be exempt from this section. 
(c)  Illuminated signs, intermittent signs, flashing signs, or moving light signs. Any illuminated sign shall not interfere with surrounding properties or traffic. Signs may be illuminated subject to the following restrictions: 
(1)  Signs which contain, include or are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, or moving lights or lights are prohibited. 
(2)  Signs which are not effectively shielded as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at any portion of the traveled way of the interstate or Federal Aid Primary Highway and which are of such intensity or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle, or which otherwise interfere with any driver's operation of a motor vehicle, are prohibited. 
(3)  No sign shall be illuminated so that it interferes with the effectiveness of, or obscures an official traffic sign, device, or signal. 
(4)  Signs may contain multiple or variable messages, formed solely by use of lights or other electronic digital displays that may be changed by any electronic process, subject to all of the following restrictions: 
a.  Each change of message shall be accomplished in one second or less. 
b.  Each message shall remain in a fixed position for at least 60 seconds. 
c.  The use of traveling or scrolling or segmented messages is prohibited. 
d.  The Chief Inspector may prohibit or establish restrictions on the illumination of messages to a degree of brightness that is greater than necessary for adequate visibility. Every electronic message unit sign shall be equipped with a light sensor. 
(d)  Specific requirements for electronic message unit signs. 
(1)  Electronic message unit signs are prohibited in all residential zoning districts as well as the TND District, Residential Planned Development Districts, and Historic Districts.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 113-38. - Pre-application. 
    It is recommended that, prior to the filing of an application for the approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider consult with the City Plan Commission and/or staff in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan components, and duly adopted plan implementation devices and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his development. In so doing, both the subdivider and City Plan Commission may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(Code 1980, § 14.13) 
Sec. 113-39. - Plats within the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction. 
    The Plan Commission and Common Council may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the dividing of lands in the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction based on the applicable criteria enumerated hereinafter. The Plan Commission may not consider any subdivision or land division which did not have prior approval by the approving authorities for both the Town(s) and La Crosse County. The Plan Commission may require any conditions in the approval of a subdivision or land division, including the use of any restrictive covenant. 
(1)  When the land to be divided lies within the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the City, the applicant shall proceed as specified in sections 113-38, 113-70, 113-71, 113-102, and 113-103 except transmittal responsibility lies with the City Clerk, Town Clerk or County Planning Agency to whomever the plat is first submitted; and the subdivider shall indicate which one in his application. 
(2)  Approval agencies shall be as specified in Wis. Stats. ch. 236; and the applicant must comply with the land division regulations of said agencies or units of government. 
(3)  Applicant may proceed with the installation of such improvements and under such regulations as the Town Board of the Town within whose limits the plat lies may require, provided that none of the approval agencies object to such improvements. Whenever connection to any City utility is desired, permission for such connection shall be approved by the governing body. All improvement requirements specified by the Town Board, other approval agencies or any special improvement district in matters over which they have jurisdiction, shall be met before filing of the final plat. 
(4)  Criteria for subdivision or land division. No subdivision as defined in this Ordinance will be permitted within the City of La Crosse's extraterritorial jurisdiction. Certified Survey Maps may be permitted provided the divided parcels will each be at least 35 acres, subject to Plan Commission and Common Council approvals. The Plan Commission and Common Council may make exceptions, provided that the proposed subdivision or land division complies with each of the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed subdivision or land division shall be compatible with adjacent land uses and shall maintain the general land use pattern of the area in question. 
b.  The proposed subdivision or land division shall result in a development pattern which is compatible with surrounding developments and land uses. Measures of compatibility shall consider lot sizes, traffic generation, access, noise and visual features. 
c.  The proposed subdivision or land division and the resulting development shall not demonstrably adversely affect the City's ability to provide public services, install public improvements or accomplish future annexations. The Plan Commission and Common Council may consider annexation agreements with the property owner in order to comply with this requirement but shall not conditionally approve a subdivision subject to receiving a petition for annexation. The Plan Commission and Common Council may also consider whether the City and Town(s) have reached an agreement on necessary public improvements and public services facilities required to serve the development. 
d.  The proposed subdivision or land division shall comply with one of the following: 
1.  The proposed subdivision or land division shall represent infilling of vacant land. Infilling is defined as a subdivision or land division which will accommodate the development of vacant land located such that surrounding existing land uses render the land impractical for any but similar uses. 
2.  The proposed subdivision or land division shall provide permanent open space lands for use by the general public in conformance with the adopted Parks and Open Space Plan for La Crosse County, Wisconsin, the City of La Crosse adopted Parks and Open Space Plan or the City's other adopted Comprehensive Plan elements. The permanent open space lands shall be accessible and open for use by the general public. The open space lands shall be exclusive from, and in addition to, lands required for dedication to comply with applicable public parks and open space dedication requirements. For the purpose of this provision, wetlands, flood plain lands, steep slopes, or other lands which are not developable because of sensitive environmental features shall be counted as permanent open space lands. Steep slopes shall include lands which have grades of 30 percent or more. 
(e)  No land shall be subdivided which is held by the City Plan Commission and Common Council to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, bad drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitation for development, severe erosion potential, or unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to health, safety or welfare of future residents or landowners in the proposed subdivision or of the community. The City Plan Commission and Common Council in applying the provisions of this section shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for the proposed use, after affording the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such suitability at a public hearing. 
(f)  The proposed subdivision or land division does not conflict with existing or planned public investments by the city or village, such as a conflict with park, parkway, expressway, major highways, airports, drainage channels, schools, or other planned public development. 
(g)  In evaluating the proposed land division, the City shall enforce the most stringent land division ordinance whether it be the County, the Town or the City's ordnance as required by State Law.

(a)  In any new subdivision the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location indicated on the Official Map, and Confluence: The La Crosse Comprehensive Plan, which was adopted by the Common Council in December 2002. The street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of land to be served by such streets, and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street. 
(b)  Arterial streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, shopping areas, recreation areas, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(c)  Collector streets, as defined in this chapter, shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic from residential areas to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major streets into which they feed. 
(d)  Local streets, as defined in this chapter, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(e)  Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by the topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Common Council, after review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. 
(f)  Arterial street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to an existing or proposed arterial street (except minor arterial), adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line or by the use of frontage streets. 
(g)  Stream or lake shores shall have 60 feet of public access platted to the water's edge at intervals of not more than one-half mile as required by Wis. Stat. ch. 236. 
(h)  Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is placed with the Common Council under conditions recommended by the City Plan Commission and approved by the Common Council. 
(i)  Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts for off-street loading and service access unless otherwise required by the Common Council, after review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission, but shall not be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall not be approved, and alleys shall not connect to a major thoroughfare. 
(j)  Street names. All streets shall be named in conformity with the street naming plan of the City or with adjoining streets. In the case of diverging streets, the name shall be repeated. New street names shall not duplicate the names of existing streets; provided, however, that streets that are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of the existing streets. Long or continuous thoroughfares running north and south shall be named avenues; those running east and west shall be named streets; diagonal thoroughfares shall be named roads; and curving thoroughfares shall be named drives. Short or discontinuous thoroughfares running north and south shall be named courts; those running east and west shall be named places or lanes.

    Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent a limited access highway or railroad ROW, the design shall provide the following treatment: 
(1)  When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the ROW of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be a part of the platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs, the building of structures hereon prohibited." The reservation of such strip also shall be indicated on protective covenants or building restrictions. However, the Common Council may control the planting of trees or shrubs near street intersections so as to provide safe sight distances. 
(2)  Commercial and Industrial Districts shall have provided, on each side of the limited access highway, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highways, but not less than 150 feet unless frontage streets are approved by the Common Council, after review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission. 
(3)  Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad ROW, when intersecting a major street and highway or collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad ROW. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. The location of frontage streets shall be as approved by the Common Council, after review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission. 
(4)  Local streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided, and location of local streets immediately adjacent arterial streets and highways and railroad ROWs shall be avoided in residential areas unless frontage streets are approved by the Common Council, after review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission.

d.  The order of classification of uses from highest to lowest for the purposes of this section shall be as follows: Residence District uses, Multiple Dwelling District uses, Local Business District uses, Commercial District uses, Light Industrial District uses, Heavy Industrial District uses, as permitted under this chapter. 
e.  A nonconforming use shall not be extended, but the extension of a use to any portion of a building, which portion is on the effective date of this chapter, primarily arranged or designed for such nonconforming use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a nonconforming use. 
f.  The remodeling involving structural alterations made in a nonconforming building shall not during its life exceed 50 percent of its assessed value, nor shall the building be enlarged, unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use. 
1.  No modification or additions shall be allowed to any existing structures which are not in compliance with permitted floodway standards or uses, unless such modifications or additions meet all the following criteria: 
(i)  The modifications or additions to a structure will not increase the amount of obstruction to flood flows pursuant to article V, division 2 of this chapter; 
(ii)  Any addition to a structure shall be floodproofed by means other than the use of fill to the flood protection elevation;

(2)  To hear and grant appeals for variances as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit and purposes of this chapter shall be observed and the public safety, welfare and justice secured. A variance: 
a.  Shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter. 
b.  Shall not permit any change in established flood elevations or profiles. 
c.  Shall not be granted for a use that is common to a group of adjacent lots or premises. (In such a case, this chapter would have to be amended through proper procedures.) 
d.  Shall not be granted unless it is shown that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest or damaging to the rights of other persons or property values in the area. 
e.  Shall not be granted for actions which require an amendment to the floodplain zoning provisions of this chapter. 
f.  Shall not have the effect of allowing or expanding a use or structure which is prohibited in that zoning district by the floodplain zoning provisions of this chapter or Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116.

a.  Flood district boundaries. When the location of the Flood Zoning Overlay or Floodway district boundaries are established by flood maps or engineering studies pursuant to section 115-110, the flood elevations or "flood profiles" for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary. If no elevation or profiles are available to the Board, any other available evidence may be examined. 
b.  In all cases, the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Appeals and if he chooses, submit his own technical evidence. If the Board determines that the district boundary as mapped is incorrect, the person contesting the location of the boundary may then proceed to petition La Crosse City Council for a map amendment, pursuant to section 115-87. 
(4)  To permit a change of nonconforming use to another of the same classification where the Board, after public hearing thereon, deems that the proposed use will be no more harmful to the surrounding neighborhood, from the standpoint of the purposes of this chapter, than the existing nonconforming use; provided, however, the Board of Appeals shall not have authority to authorize structural alterations or additions to be made to the building or structures nor authorize an extension of a nonconforming use. 
(5)  To hear and grant applications for unclassified and unspecified uses provided that such uses are similar in character to the principal uses permitted in the district. 
(6)  The Board may reverse, affirm wholly or partly modify the requirements appealed from, and may direct the issue of a permit.

Sec. 115-156. - Planned Development District. 
(a)  Purpose. This section applies to the Planned Development District. 
(1)  The Planned Development District is intended to permit developments that will, over a period of time, be enhanced by coordinated area site planning, diversified location of structures and/or mixing of compatible uses. Such developments are intended to provide a safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicular traffic; to provide attractive recreation and open spaces as integral parts of the developments; to enable economic design in the location of public and private utilities and community facilities; and to ensure adequate standards of construction and planning. The Planned Development District under this chapter will allow for flexibility of overall development design with benefits from such design flexibility intended to be derived by both the developer and the community. 
(2)  This is a zoning district that may be developed only in accordance with a specific comprehensive development plan. The approved specific comprehensive development plan is an integral part of this zoning district and all development shall comply with said plan. The Planned Development District is designed and intended to enable and encourage the development of large tracts of land or urban infill sites which are planned under unified ownership or control, or lands which by reason of existing or planned land uses are appropriate for development under this section, so as to achieve land development patterns which will maintain and enhance the physical, social and economic values of an area. 
(3)  The unified and planned development of a site under a specific comprehensive development plan in an individual, single entity, partnership or corporate ownership or control or in common ownership under the Condominium Ownership Act set forth in Wis. Stat. ch. 703 (condominiums) may be permitted by the City upon specific petition, with such development encompassing one or more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses or structures when all regulations and standards as set forth in this section have been met. 
(b)  Use regulations . In the Planned Development District, such development may encompass one or more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses or structures with a continuity of design and development, under a unified specific and precise comprehensive development plan, where the implementation of said plan is conducted by single, partnership, corporate, limited liability company, condominium or association ownership. The use or uses of each Planned Development District shall be individually or specifically approved, and may be a use permitted in the Single Family Residence, Residence, Multiple Dwelling, Local Business, Commercial, Light Industrial, Heavy Industrial, Public and Semi-Public, Public Utility, or Parking Lot Districts, or a combination of uses permitted in different zoning districts. There may be provided within Planned Development Districts a combination of land uses, including a variety of residential types, commercial, industrial, public and semi-public areas, arranged and designed in accordance with sound land planning principles and development techniques; and in such a manner as to be properly related to each other, the surrounding community, the planned thoroughfare system, and other public facilities such as water and sewer systems, parks, schools and utilities. 
(c)  Area regulations. Areas designated as Planned Development Districts shall be under single or unified ownership or control as specified above and shall contain a minimum gross development area as follows: 
Planned Development Minimum Area of Principal Uses Residential Planned Development Two acres Commercial Planned Development Two acres Industrial Planned Development Two acres Mixed Compatible Use Two acres  
(d)  Other regulations. Height, yard, vision, setback, parking, lot coverage, and other related standards applicable to similar uses in other comparable zoning districts shall be considered by the City Plan Commission and the Council in establishing specific regulations for each Planned Development District. In the Planned Development District there shall be no predetermined specific lot area, lot width, height, bulk or floor area ratio, yard, usable open space, sign and off-street parking requirements, but such requirements as are made a part of an approved specific and precise comprehensive development plan and shall be, along with the plan itself, construed to be and enforced as a part of this section. For Residential Planned Development Districts over ten acres in gross area, there shall be a minimum of 20 percent of the gross acreage dedicated for useable permanent open space, which open space area shall not include land set aside for utility easements (with the exception of easements which provide permanent open space), rights-of-way, roadway or lot area. Areas of steep slopes and wetlands which are permanently reserved for open space may be included in the calculation of open space. For all other Planned Developments over ten acres, which do not include a residential component, the open space requirement shall be ten percent. All Planned Developments less than ten acres in gross area shall provide for useable permanent open space in an amount to be determined by the City, which amount shall be based on location, site conditions and proposed land use. The petition for zoning shall be accompanied by written terminology, graphic material, and will illustrate the conditions that the modified standards will produce, so as to enable the City Plan Commission and the Council to make the determination that the modification will produce a living environment, landscape quality and lifestyle superior to that produced under existing standards. The individual regulations for each such District created shall be adopted and published in ordinance form. All other applicable regulations, including, but not limited to, those applicable regulations continued in chapter 113 shall apply and be reviewed as part of the development review process.

    Encroachment means any fill, structure, equipment, building, use or development in the floodway. 
    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) means the Federal agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas caused by one of the following conditions: 
(1)  The overflow or rise of inland waters; 
(2)  The rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; 
(3)  The inundation caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels along the shore of Lake Michigan, Lake Superior or the Mississippi River; or 
(4)  The sudden increase caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a seiche, or by some similarly unusual event. 
    Flood frequency means the probability of a flood occurrence which is determined from statistical analyses. The frequency of a particular flood event is usually expressed as occurring, on the average, once in a specified number of years or as a percent chance of occurring in any given year. 
    Flood Hazard Boundary Map means a map designating approximate flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are designated as unnumbered A-Zones and do not contain floodway lines or regional flood elevations. This map forms the basis for both the regulatory and insurance aspects of the National flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until superseded by a Flood Insurance Study and a Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means a map of a community on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both special flood hazard areas (the floodplain) and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. This map can only be amended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood Insurance Study means a technical engineering examination, evaluation, and determination of the local flood hazard areas. It provides maps designating those areas affected by the regional flood and provides both flood insurance rate zones and base flood elevations and may provide floodway lines. The flood hazard areas are designated as numbered and unnumbered A-Zones. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, that accompany the Flood Insurance Study, form the basis for both the regulatory and the insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Flood profile means a graph or a longitudinal profile line showing the relationship of the water surface elevation of a flood event to locations of land surface elevations along a stream or river. 
    Flood protection elevation means an elevation two feet of freeboard above the water surface profile elevation designated for the regional flood. See also Freeboard . 
    Flood storage means those floodplain areas where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account during analysis in reducing the regional flood discharge. 
    Floodfringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway which is covered by floodwaters during the regional flood and associated with standing water rather than flowing water. 
    Floodplain means land which has been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. It includes the floodway and the floodfringe, and may include other designated floodplain areas for regulatory purposes. 
    Floodplain island means a natural geologic land formation within the floodplain that is surrounded, but not covered, by floodwater during the regional flood. 
    Floodplain management means policy and procedures to ensure wise use of floodplains, including mapping and engineering, mitigation, education, and administration and enforcement of floodplain regulations. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural provisions, changes or adjustments to properties and structures, water and sanitary facilities and contents of buildings subject to flooding, for the purpose of reducing or eliminating flood damage. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood discharge. 
    Freeboard means a safety factor expressed in terms of a specified number of feet above a calculated flood level. Freeboard compensates for any factors that cause flood heights greater than those calculated, including ice jams, debris accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the effects of watershed urbanization, loss of flood storage areas due to development and aggregation of the river or stream bed. 
    Habitable structure means any structure or portion thereof used or designated for human habitation. 
    Hearing notice means publication or posting meeting the requirements of Wis. Stat. ch. 985. For appeals, a Class 1 notice, published at least one week (seven days) before the hearing, is required. For all zoning ordinances and amendments, a Class 2 notice, published twice, one each week consecutively, the last at least a week (seven days) before the hearing. Local ordinances or bylaws may require additional notice, exceeding these minimums. 
    High flood damage potential means damage that could result from flooding that includes any danger to life or health or any significant economic loss to a structure or building and its contents. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is either: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered Historic District or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered Historic District; 
(3)  Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved State program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Increase in regional flood height means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, greater than 0.00 feet, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which are directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge. 
    Land use means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (See also: Development .) 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3. 
    Maintenance means the act or process of restoring to original soundness, including redecorating, refinishing, non-structural repairs, or the replacement of existing fixtures, systems or equipment with equivalent fixtures, systems or structures.

    Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision, existing means a parcel of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale, on which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots is completed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. At a minimum, this would include the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
    Mobile/manufactured home park, expansion to existing means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed. This includes installation of utilities, construction of streets and either final site grading, or the pouring if concrete pads. 
    Mobile recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a licensed, light-duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the definition of "mobile recreational vehicles."

    Model, existing (pre-project) means a modification of the Duplicate Effective Model or Corrected Effective Model to reflect any manmade modifications that have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the effective model but prior to the construction of the project for which the revision is being requested. If no modification has occurred since the date of the effective model, then this model would be identical to the Corrected Effective Model or Duplicate Effective Model. 
    Model, revised (post-project) means a modification of the Existing or Pre-Project Conditions Model, Duplicate Effective Model or Corrected Effective Model to reflect revised or post-project conditions. 
    Municipality or municipal means the City governmental units enacting, administering and enforcing this chapter. 
    NAVD or North American Vertical Datum means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1988 adjustment. 
    NGVD or National Geodetic Vertical Datum means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment. 
    New construction , for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations were adopted by the City of La Crosse and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use; however, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
    Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this division for the area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence in the floodway). 
    Nonflood disaster means a fire, ice storm, tornado, wind storm, mudslide, or other destructive act of nature, excluding floods. 
    Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height. 
    Official Floodplain Zoning Map means that map, adopted and made part of this division, as described in section 115-255, which has been approved by the DNR and FEMA. 
    Open space use means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures. 
    Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. 
    Person means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or State agency. 
    Private sewage system means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by the Department of Safety and Professional Services, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure. 
    Public utilities means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer. 
    Reach, hydraulic, means that portion of the river or stream extending from one significant change in the hydraulic character of the river or stream to the next significant change. These changes are usually associated with breaks in the slope of the water surface profile, and may be caused by bridges, dams, expansion and contraction of the water flow, and changes in the stream bed slope or vegetation. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
    Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Storage capacity of a floodplain means the volume of space above an area of floodplain that can be occupied by floodwater of a given stage at a given time, regardless of whether the water is moving. 
    Structural alterations means any change in the supporting members of a building, such as the bearing walls, columns, beams, or girders. 
    Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts. 
    Subdivision means has the meaning given in Wis. Stat. § 236.02(12). 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this division. 
    Utilities means any public or private water supply or waste collection and/or disposal system, including but not limited to: septic systems, private and public wells, and their attendant facilities, and public sewage collection systems. 
    Variance means an authorization by the Board of Appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in this division. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface profile means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas. 
    Watershed means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Well means an excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.

(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Code 1980, § 15.03(A)(3); Ord. No. 4932 , § I(attch.), 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 115-212. - Amendments. 
    Obstructions or increases may only be permitted if amendments are made to this section, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with section 115-212(a).

Stat. § 62.23(7)(h), for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this division or any amendment thereto. 
(2)  The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this division may continue subject to the following conditions: 
a.  No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this division. The terms "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Maintenance is not considered a modification ; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not considered maintenance. The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
b.  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this division. 
c.  The City shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent.

No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceeds 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this division. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 115-281(3)a. The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50 percent provisions of this section. 
e.  No maintenance to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which would equal or exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this section. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 115-281(3)(a). 
f.  If on a per event basis the total value of the work being done under (d) and (e) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the present equalized assessed value the work shall not be permitted unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this section. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 115-281(3)(a). 
g.

    Other floodplain districts may be established under this division and reflected on the floodplain zoning map. These districts may include General Floodplain Districts and Flood Storage Districts. 
(1)  General Floodplain District (GFP) : 
a.  Applicability . The provisions for this district shall apply to all floodplains mapped as A, AO or AH zones. 
b.  Permitted uses . Pursuant to subsection (1)d of this section, it shall be determined whether the proposed use is located within the floodway or floodfringe. Those uses permitted in floodway (section 115-280(2)) and floodfringe areas (section 115-281(2)) are allowed within the general floodplain district, according to the standards of subsection (3) of this section, provided that all permits or certificates under section 115-223(a) have been issued. 
c.  Standards for development . Section 115-280 applies to floodway areas, section 115-281 applies to floodfringe areas. The rest of this subsection applies to either district. 
1.  In AO/AH Zones, the structures lowest floor must meet one of the conditions listed below whichever is higher: 
(i)  At or above the flood protection elevation; or 
(ii)  Two feet above the highest adjacent grade around the structure; or 
(iii)  The depth as shown on the FIRM. 
2.  In AO/AH zones, provide plans showing adequate drainage paths to guide flood waters around structures. 
d.  Determining floodway and floodfringe . Upon receiving an application for development within the General Floodplain District, the Department of Planning and Development shall: 
1.  Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to the general floodplain district limits, stream channel, and existing floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and floodproofing measures; and the flood zone as shown on the FIRM. 
2.  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information deemed necessary by the DNR to evaluate the effects of the proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation and to determine floodway boundaries: 
(i)  A Hydrologic and Hydraulic Study as specified in section 115-223(a)(2)(c); 
(ii)  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information; 
(iii)  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage, water supply and sanitary facilities. 
(2)  Flood Storage District . The Flood Storage District delineates that portion of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher flood elevations. 
a.  Applicability . The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the Flood Storage District (FSD), as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Maps. 
b.  Permitted uses . Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in section 115-281(3). 
c.  Standards for development in Flood Storage Districts. 
1.  Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal to or greater than 0.01 feet in the height of the regional flood. 
2.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the pre-development ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
3.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as Flood Storage District on this waterway is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage, as per section 115-212(a). 
4.  No area may be removed from the Flood Storage District unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain. 
(3)  Shallow Depth Flood Plain Zoning Overlay District (SDFP) . The SDFP shall mean those areas where the maximum depth of flooding does not exceed one foot in depth nor six hours in duration during the regional flood. Therefore, the applicable provisions of section 115-281(3)a and b shall apply.

(1)  Each historic preservation plan shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(2)  The Historic District plan shall distinguish between buildings that contribute to the distinctive architectural or special historic character of the Historic District as a whole and therefore should be preserved (contributing buildings) and those buildings that fail to so contribute (noncontributing buildings). The plan shall also distinguish between a unit of property which includes a physical betterment constituting an improvement and the land embracing the site thereof, known as an improvement parcel, and an unimproved area of land to be known as a noncontributing parcel. 
(c)  The development of a Historic District plan may include the following: 
(1)  All new structures or additions should be constructed to a height visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which they are visually related. 
(2)  The gross volume of any new structure or addition should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(3)  In the street elevation of a building, the proportion between the width and height in the facade should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(4)  The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in the street facade should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(5)  The materials used in the final facade should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(6)  The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(7)  The design of the roof should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(8)  The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual building, its occupants and their needs. Further, the landscape treatment should be visually compatible with the contributing buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
(9)  The street facade should blend with other buildings via directional expression. When adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or vertical expression, this expression should be carried over and reflected. 
(10)  Architectural elements should be incorporated as necessary to relate the new with the old and to preserve and enhance the inherent characteristics of the area. 
(d)  Notice and review of the Historic District designation shall include any proposed Historic Preservation plan, including review by the City Plan Commission and final approval by the Common Council.

1.  Shutters should not be installed on buildings where they were not originally used. 
2.  Where appropriate, shutters should appear to be operable and mounted to the window casing. 
3.  Shutters should be constructed of wood. 
(6)  Porches and steps. 
a.  Repair and replacement . 
1.  Retain and conserve porches, steps and handrails that are original and/or appropriate to the dwelling. 
2.  If partial replacement or rebuilding is necessary, reconstruct the porch using historical research to determine an appropriate design. 
3.  Porches on the front of buildings should not be enclosed. 
4.  Reopening of previously enclosed front porches is encouraged when appropriate to the original dwelling. 
b.  Porch elements. 
1.  Posts, columns and railings should be preserved and maintained. 
2.  If partial replacement or rebuilding is necessary, use material to match the original in dimensions and detailing. Elaborate details on posts may be simplified, if necessary. 
3.  Railings and balusters should be replaced or rebuilt in the original space, section and profile as the original. 
4.  Replacement balusters on a porch railing should be appropriate for the dwelling's style and period. 
5.  Metal posts and metal railings should not be used to replace wooden porch materials. 
6.  Wood porch floors should be replaced with wood rather than concrete. 
7.  Open sections of the porch foundation may be filled in with materials such as lattice panels that are appropriate for the age and style of the dwelling. Research should be conducted to identify appropriate materials. 
c.  Steps and stairs . 
1.  Steps and stairs should be retained in their original location and configuration. 
2.  Wood and concrete steps should be repaired to match the original. 
3.  If new steps are necessary, wood and concrete steps should have treads, risers and handrails to match the original. 
4.  Concrete steps should not be used to replace wooden steps. 
(7)  Decorative trim. 
a.  Repair and replacement . 
1.  New material used to repair or replace deteriorated trim should match the original as closely as possible. 
2.  Deteriorated trim or features should be photographed or documented before being removed for repair or replacement so that the feature can be used as a pattern in selecting replacement materials. 
3.  With HPC approval, elaborate trim may be replaced with simplified trim that matches the old in design and placement. 
4.  New trim should be added only when there is clear evidence that such trim was original to the dwelling, or when there is documentation that similar trim was used on other dwellings of that style and age. 
5.  Wood epoxy may be used to repair deteriorated or damaged trim if approved by the HPC. 
(f)  Design review standards for new construction . These guidelines apply to additions to existing houses, including additions of porches or decks; (accessory buildings), including carriage houses; and a complete new structure. 
(1)  General design considerations . 
a.  New construction of primary buildings, such as dwellings, should reflect the historic and architectural character of the district in building scale, massing, proportions and materials. New construction should reflect its own era, however, and not attempt to be falsely "historic." 
b.  Additions should reflect the building scale, massing, proportions and materials of the original building. Additions should be designed to blend with character of the original building. 
c.  Accessory buildings should reflect the general style of the primary building but are not required to replicate the style in detail. 
(2)  Building placement . 
a.  Placement of new buildings and additions should reflect the placement of surrounding buildings on the block face. 
b.  New construction shall meet the established front yard setback line, or fall within the range established for that block face. 
c.  New construction shall conform to the established side yard setback pattern for that block face. 
(3)  Building massing and proportions. 
a.  Height and width . The proportions of new construction should respect the average height and width of the majority of buildings on the block face. 
(4)  Building elements. 
a.  Windows and doors . 
1.  Most windows within the district have a vertical orientation, with proportions of 2 or 3 to 1 (height to width). The proportion, size, rhythm and detailing of windows and doors in new construction should be compatible with that of adjacent buildings, but need not exactly replicate them. 
2.  Internal window divisions (mullions) should match the original building on walls facing the street. On nonstreet facades or rear walls, one-over-one wood sash may be substituted for more complex mullion patterns. 
3.  Window openings should be recessed, to create a pattern of light and shadow. 
(See "Renovation" standards on window material.) 
b.  Roofs . Roofs of new buildings or additions should be compatible in pitch, shape and materials with the principal building or nearby buildings. No vents, skylights, or other openings should be located on the front roof plane or sides visible from the street. 
c.  Decks . Unenclosed decks are incompatible with the character and historical period of the district. Decks shall be constructed only at the rear of buildings or where they are least conspicuous from the public way. Decks should not extend beyond the width of the building. 
d.  Entries . Entries should be located on the facade facing the public way. Entries to new principal buildings should be articulated with a porch or portico similar in character to nearby buildings. 
e.  Exterior details . Exterior details such as building trim or window and door hardware should be generally compatible with the style and materials of the original building, but need not replicate every detail of the original building. 
(5)  Building materials . Building materials used in new construction should conform to those used on existing contributing buildings within the district: masonry, wood siding and wood shingles. However, if approved by the HPC, synthetic siding may be used on accessory buildings such as carriage houses to simulate horizontal lapsiding. Cementitious siding ("Hardiplank") is the most satisfactory in simulating wood siding. 
(6)  Additions . Exterior additions to existing buildings can radically alter their appearance. Additions that are visible from a public street or sidewalk should be designed with scale, shape and materials that are consistent with those of the existing building. However, the addition should not be "disguised" as original: the use of the same wall plane, roof line or cornice height as the original building is not recommended. 
a.  Additions on sides of buildings are discouraged, while additions at the rear of a building should not extend beyond the width of the building. 
b.  The roof of an addition should be lower in height than the main roof of the existing building, but compatible in pitch, shape and materials. 
c.  The foundation of an addition should match the material or appearance of the original foundation, and should also match the foundation sill height of the existing structure to present an unbroken line around the building's ground-level perimeter. 
(7)  Accessory buildings . Accessory buildings include carriage houses, garages and other small buildings. 
a.  Carriage houses . Carriage houses are among the character-defining features of the Tenth and Cass Neighborhood Historic District. Originally designed as small barns, they now generally function as garages, although their height allows for other uses such as home offices. As a unique type of accessory building, carriage houses in the City's older neighborhoods are subject to special provisions in this chapter, allowing greater height and building coverage. This chapter provides general design guidance for carriage houses: "The architecture of the accessory structure shall be historically compatible with the architecture of the primary structure appropriate to the period. The architecture of the accessory structure is not required to match the architecture of the primary structure so long as the architecture is appropriate to the period." The following standards apply to carriage houses and other accessory buildings as well. 
1.  Placement on lot. Outbuildings shall be located in rear yards with vehicular access from the alley, in keeping with the established pattern. 
2.  Wooden garage doors are recommended but not required. Metal doors, where used, should be simple in shape and without ornamentation. 
3.  Windows should generally match the shape of windows on the principal building, but may be smaller in size, consistent with the scale of the building, and may employ simpler divisions (one-over-one wood sash, or windows with fixed, simulated muntins). 
4.  Materials similar to those of the principal building are preferred. However, if approved by the HPC, synthetic cementitious siding (such as "Hardiplank") or vinyl siding may be used to simulate wood siding, with a profile and lap exposure similar to that of the principal building. 
(g)  Site design . Most houses within the district, with or without porches, are set back a relatively even distance from the street. Front yards are typical of many residential neighborhoods: many have lawns extending to the sidewalk, while others have low ornamental fences or stone walls at the edge of the sidewalk. Some lawns slope upwards slightly from the street level. Many houses have foundation plantings, and mature shrubs are found within most yards. Boulevards with evenly spaced canopy trees are located between the sidewalk and the street. All these elements give a pedestrian scale to the street and create a transition between public and private spaces. Driveways are typically concrete and single-lane in width. Most driveways take access from alleys to detached carriage houses or garages or parking areas at the rear of each lot. There is currently only one off-street surface parking lot within the district; providing parking for an adjacent medical office outside the district. The "alleyscape" differs from the streetscape. Alleys bisect every block within the district, and provide access to most garage and parking areas, with the exception of outbuildings on a few corner lots. Most rear yards are separated from the alley by a fence or wall, usually higher than those in the front yard and by the wall of the carriage house or garage. Improvements or changes in site design should be consistent with the pattern described above. 
(1)  Off-street parking shall be located to the rear of the principal building, in locations that are least visible from the street. 
(2)  Surface parking areas visible from the street shall be fenced with ornamental iron or painted wooden fences or low stone walls. Fencing within front yards shall be no higher than four feet. 
(3)  Wooden or ornamental iron fences are encouraged along rear lot lines abutting the alley. 
(4)  Front yards may remain open to the street or may be fenced, if desired, with ornamental iron or painted wooden fences or low stone walls. Fencing shall be no higher than four feet, in order to allow visibility into front yards. 
(5)  Air conditioners, heat pumps, and other outdoor equipment should be located where they are least visible from the street. 
(6)  In planting strips along the street, canopy trees should be added to "fill in" locations where they are lacking. 
(h)  Appeal . Applicants may appeal any HPC decision to the Common Council. An appeal shall be in writing specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is based and shall be filed with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date of the decision of the HPC that is being appealed. 
(Code 1980, § 15.38(G); Ord. No. 4911 , § I(attch.), 1-14-2016) 
Sec. 115-320. - Design standards for the Historic Overlay District known as the Downtown Commercial Historic District. 
(a)  Purpose . Pursuant to Section 115-313 of this Code, the purpose of this subsection is to foster the City's Comprehensive Plan to identify the City's historic and architectural resources for designation and protection, to establish a coordinated preservation program and to provide tools to protect significant resources. Its purpose is also to preserve the integrity of the historic architectural features, guide public and private development, protect public and private investment, and establish consistent rules for all. The local district designation of the Downtown Commercial Historic District is created to encourage preservation of the historic resources of the district, which district was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. This subsection will provide design standards and review procedures to guide preservation, rehabilitation, new construction, relocation and demolitions within the Downtown Commercial Historic District (District). Implementing these design standards are in conformance with the Downtown Commercial Heritage Preservation Plan for the district that was adopted by the Common Council in December of 2004. These standards shall apply to all construction located within the Downtown Commercial National Register Historic District. These standards shall apply to newly constructed buildings; all exterior/facade renovations or rehabilitations, including non-structural repairs; additions; building relocations; and demolitions. The property owner shall meet the requirements of this section and obtain Heritage Preservation Commission (HPC) approval as a condition of obtaining a building permit. These regulations shall not apply to building renovations using the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The standards contained in this section shall supersede all the City of La Crosse ordinances as they relate to commercial construction and development within the Downtown Commercial National Register Historic District, and if there is a conflict, this ordinance shall control, unless specifically stated. 
(b)  Boundaries . The Downtown Commercial Historic District boundary is as follows (generally described as the area between State Street, 2 nd Street, Jay Street and the east side of 5 th Avenue): 
Beginning at the northeast corner of Main Street and 2 nd Street South, continuing easterly along the south curb of Main Street to the southwest corner of Main Street and 3 rd Street South, continuing northerly on the east curb of 3 rd Street North to the northeast corner of 3 rd Street North and State Street, then continuing easterly along the south curb of State Street to the southwest corner of State Street and 4 th Street North, continuing southerly along the west curb of 4 th Street North to 115 4 th Street North, turning east across 4 th Street North, continuing easterly along the rear north lot lines of the 400 block of Main Street. Continue easterly across 5 th Avenue South, following the rear (north) lot lines of 507-511 Main Street. Then turning southwest, continue to the southside of Main Street, following the rear (east) lot lines of 512 Main Street and 111-123 5 th Avenue South. Continue south across Jay Street, to follow the rear (east) lot lines of 201-211 5 th Avenue South, then turn west along the south (side) lot line of 211 5 th Avenue South to the east side of 5 th Avenue South continuing northerly to the northeast corner of 5 th Avenue South and Jay Street. Turn west, following the north curb of Jay Street, continuing along the 400 block of Jay Street. Continue west across 4 th Street South to follow the north curb of the 300 block of Jay Street. At the northeast corner of Jay Street and 3 rd Street South continue northerly along the east curb of 3 rd Street South to the northeast corner of 3 rd Street South and Pearl Street, turning west on Pearl Street. Continue westerly along the north curb of the 200 block of Pearl Street to the northeast corner of Pearl Street and 2 nd Street South, turning north and continuing northerly along the east curb of the 100 block of 2nd Street South to the northeast corner of 2 nd Street South and Main Street which is the point of beginning. 
(c)  Height regulations . In the Downtown Commercial Historic District, no building shall hereafter be erected or structurally altered to exceed 100 feet. 
(d)  Regulation of construction, renovation, rehabilitation, relocation, and demolition . 
(1)  No owner or person in charge of a structure within the District shall renovate, rehabilitate, modify, alter, move any building or construct any addition or new structure unless a Certificate of Appropriateness has been granted by the HPC. No owner or person in charge of a structure within the District may demolish any part of the exterior of such property unless a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition has been granted by the HPC. The Building and Inspections Department shall not issue a permit for any such work unless a Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate for Appropriateness for Demolition has been granted. If work begins prior to obtaining the necessary permits, a Stop Work Order may be issued by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Protection and Building Safety. 
(2)  Certificate of Appropriateness for Major/Minor Work . 
a.  Prior to obtaining any building permit, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed with the Planning Department. 
b.  The Planning Department shall have available upon request applications for Certificates of Appropriateness and application instructions identifying the information and documentation needed in order to complete the application. Applications shall include full color drawings, photographs, plans or other complete documentation to fully illustrate the property and the proposed work. The HPC shall determine the application requirements. 
c.  Administrative review of minor work . The Preservation Planner may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness after review of a completed application if the project entails minor work. Minor work includes the following and as further defined by the HPC in its application instructions: re-roofing with similar materials; repair or replacement of porches, windows, siding, trim and doors if new materials match existing; installation or replacement of awnings; chimney reconstruction if completed with similar materials; exterior cleaning, except graffiti, refinishing and tuckpointing; construction of retaining walls, fences and landscaping; screening of parking lots and dumpsters or other work as designated minor by the HPC. Minor work may be performed without prior approval in emergency situations that occur due to vandalism or acts of nature. The property owner will be required to provide the Preservation Planner with documentation of the work performed. Minor work decisions made by the Preservation Planner may be appealed to the Heritage Preservation Commission. 
d.  HPC review of major work . Upon the filing of a complete application for major work, the HPC shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness or deny the application within 45 days of the filing of the application, unless the time period is otherwise extended by written agreement between the HPC and the applicant. Major work includes the following and as further defined by the HPC in its application instructions: construction of garages; roof alterations and skylights; alterations to any side or elevation of the building; additions; alterations to windows, siding, entries, and trim; masonry finishing; construction of chimneys; erection or replacement of signs; new construction; and relocation. 
e.  In making its decision about issuing a Certificate of Appropriateness involving new construction, renovation or rehabilitation, the HPC shall consider the design review standards set forth in this subsection. Alterations to building interiors not subject to design review. The HPC shall consider that the structure be of an age, architectural style and massing consistent with existing structures within the District. 
f.  The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits or approvals required by applicable federal, state or local code. 
(3)  Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition . 
a.  An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition shall be filed with the Planning Department. The Planning Department shall have available, upon request, applications for Certificates of Appropriateness for Demolition and application instructions, identifying the information and documentation needed in order to complete the application. 
b.  The HPC shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition or deny the application within 45 days of the filing of a complete application, unless the time period is otherwise extended by written agreement between the HPC and the applicant. 
c.  In determining whether to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition, the HPC shall: 
1.  Consider factors such as whether the structure is of historical significance, the state of repair of the building, or if the owner can demonstrate that the building is structurally unsound and/or that denial of a demolition permit would create a significant economic hardship for the owner, however, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created or which is the result of inexcusable neglect to maintain the property in good repair shall not qualify as a basis for the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition. 
2.  Issue the certificate only if the owner can demonstrate that the building is structurally unsound and/or that denial of a demolition permit would create a significant economic hardship for the owner. 
(4)  Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit the demolition or alteration of any structure within the District pursuant to an order of any governmental agency or Court, for the purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to health or safety. In such cases, no approval from the HPC shall be required. 
(e)  Design Review Standards for Renovation and Rehabilitation . These standards specify appropriate maintenance, renovation, and repair of elements on properties within the District and must be reviewed and approved by the Heritage Preservation Planner or the HPC. 
(1)  Masonry walls and foundations . It is the intent of this section to have clay brick walls or stone masonry walls exposed whenever possible. Cinder block masonry walls or poured concrete walls may be covered with materials that blend in with the predominantly clay brick walls within the District upon approval by the Heritage Preservation Commission. 
a.  Repair . 
1.  When there is evidence of deterioration, masonry walls and other masonry features shall be repaired by repointing of mortar joints. 
2.  Brick, stone and mortar shall be replaced with the materials used in original construction or materials that closely resemble the original. 
3.  Repointing of mortar shall match the original brick and mortar joint profile, including width and depth. Mortar shall duplicate the original in color, texture and strength. If possible, mortar mixtures shall duplicate the original composition in lime, sand, and cement proportion. 
4.  Repair stucco by duplicating the original material in strength, composition, color and texture. If possible, it is recommended that stucco be removed during renovation if it covers a masonry wall. 
5.  Artificial stone, brick veneer, vinyl or aluminum products, timbers, plywood, stucco, or other similar materials shall not be applied over masonry surfaces unless it was to repair an existing material. An exception to permit materials that will be applied over masonry surfaces may be requested from the HPC for the purpose of creating a "mural". The HPC will review such materials and how they will be attached, connected, or adhered to the building in order to evaluate any impacts. Installation shall be reversible, that is, it should leave little to no trace on the building after it is removed. A "mural" is defined as any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other large permanent surface. 
6.  "Color" in this section, refers to matching the existing or overall color, to the extent practicable. 
b.  Cleaning . 
1.  Clean masonry walls only if necessary to halt deterioration or remove heavy soiling. 
2.  When cleaning is necessary, the gentlest cleaning method shall be used, as appropriate, such as low pressure water, mild detergents and soft brushes. 
3.  Surface cleaning tests must be conducted to determine the most appropriate cleaning method. Adequate time must be allowed for the Preservation Planner to observe the results of the test to determine the gentlest cleaning method. 
4.  Sandblasting or abrasive cleaning is prohibited. 
c.  Painting . 
1.  Masonry shall not be painted (or stuccoed) if it has not been painted previously. An exception may be requested from the HPC for the purpose of creating a "mural". HPC will review such proposals in order to evaluate any impacts. Any such proposals shall include a plan for removal of the paint that can be accomplished without damage to the masonry. A "mural" is defined as any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other large permanent surface. 
2.  Paint shall not be removed from historically painted masonry unless the removal is historically appropriate and the removal can be accomplished without damage to the masonry. 
3.  Remove damaged or deteriorated paint only to the next layer, using the gentlest method (such as handscraping) prior to repainting. 
4  If repainting is required, select colors that are appropriate to the building and district. 
(2)  Commercial building facades. 
a.  Entries and storefronts . 
1.  Historic entries and storefront display windows shall be retained. 
2.  Existing entry openings shall be retained, where feasible. If additional entry openings are needed (i.e., for deliveries) they shall be placed at regular intervals and should be of similar proportions as the original entry. 
3.  Original or historic features including columns, bulkheads, transoms, moldings and hardware shall be retained; trim should be replicated if replacement is necessary. 
4.  Wood panel doors with large glass panels were typical of historic commercial storefronts in the district. To the extent possible, historic doors and hardware shall be repaired rather than replaced. 
5.  If replacement of doors is necessary, replacement doors shall be compatible with the design, proportions and materials of the original door. 
6  New doors shall be constructed of wood if possible; aluminum or other metal doors should be finished in colors complementary to the building. 
b.  Windows . 
1.  Original window openings shall be retained. Street facing facade window openings shall be filled in with a window consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. They shall not be filled in with wood, brick, or any other materials. Window openings on street viewable, side and rear facades may be filled in with any other permitted siding materials only if approved by the Heritage Preservation Commission. 
2.  Retain all decorative trim around windows, including lintels, pediments and hoods. If replacement of trim is necessary, maintain the appearance of the original material. 
3.  New window openings shall not be added on the primary façade without the approval of the HPC. 
4.  If replacement windows are required, wood windows are preferred. (If metal is chosen, it should have a baked enamel or other appropriate factory finish) Metal-clad and/or vinyl-clad windows may be considered for upper level windows or rear façade windows, with the approval of the HPC. 
5.  Sash shall be replaced with the same size and number of panes as the original sash. New sash, if required, shall match the original style and not the most recent. Replacement of double-hung windows with single panes of glass or crank-out windows is not permitted. 
6.  The HPC may require samples or examples of replacement windows to determine whether a request other that the original or period type is an appropriate replacement. 
c.  Roofs, cornices, and parapets . 
1.  The historic roofline, including the cornice, parapet or other elements, shall be retained. 
2.  If a cornice or parapet is missing, use historic photographs or examples from similar buildings to craft replacements from materials such as wood, masonry or sheet metal. 
3.  Maintain historic masonry copings along the parapet. If copings must be replaced along common party walls, metal coping with an appropriate painted finish may be used. 
4.  Modern roofing materials such as rolled rubber are appropriate for flat roofs where not visible from the street. 
5  To the extent feasible, rooftop equipment that projects above the roofline shall be set back and not visible from the street level. 
d.  Non-historic features . 
1.  Inappropriate past additions to buildings shall be considered for removal. Elements such as siding, signs, wood filler in window openings, stucco, or exterior siding materials are some materials that shall be considered for removal in renovation. 
(f)  Design Review Standards for New Construction . These guidelines apply to new buildings and additions to existing buildings. 
(1)  Building placement . 
a.  Most buildings within the district are built to the edge of the sidewalk, maintaining a continuous wall at the building line. New buildings and additions to existing buildings shall maintain the street wall, except where setbacks are used to emphasize entries or create outdoor seating areas. 
b.  Buildings shall meet the established building facade line on the block where they are located for at least 75 percent of the length of their front façade. 
c.  The remaining 25 percent of the façade may be set back up to ten feet to emphasize entries or create outdoor seating and gathering areas. 
d.  At intersections, buildings shall "hold the corner" - that is, their facades should be located at or near the sidewalk line on both streets. 
e.  Side setbacks shall only be used to create walkways or semi-public spaces such as restaurant patios. 
f.  Driveways may only be placed in side yards where no alternative (such as alley access) exists. 
(2)  Façade proportions . 
a.  Buildings shall have a well defined base, middle and top. 
b.  The base, or ground floor, shall appear visually distinct from the upper stories, through the use of a change in building materials, window shape or size, an intermediate cornice line, an awning, arcade or portico, or similar techniques. 
c.  The base or ground floor of the building shall include elements that relate to the human scale, including texture, projections, doors and windows, awnings, canopies or ornamentation. 
d.  Roofs shall be flat or gently sloped, consistent with traditional storefront commercial design. 
e.  Building tops shall be articulated with detailed cornices or parapets. 
f.  The composition of the façade shall be similar to that of surrounding facades. This includes: 
1.  Proportions of openings. 
2.  Relation of width to height. Larger buildings shall be broken into a number of smaller bays, to maintain a rhythm similar to the surrounding buildings. 
3.  Floor to ceiling ratios. 
g.  Side walls . 
1.  Party wall construction is typical within the District. Therefore, relatively few buildings have visible side walls. Where side walls are visible, window openings shall be consistent in their proportions with those on the front facade. 
(3)  Building height . 
a.  New buildings shall continue the traditional patterns of two or more stories in height. 
b.  Maximum height should be based on the pattern established by surrounding buildings on the block face. 
(4)  Building materials . 
a.  Building materials shall be consistent with the predominant materials in use in the District. 
b.  Painting of brick buildings is discouraged and shall not be used on new construction. Brick additions may be painted if the existing building is already painted. The paint color of the addition shall match the paint color of the existing building. 
c.  The following materials are appropriate on front or primary façades (those facing the street): 
1.  Clay brick 
2.  Natural stone 
3.  Cast stone 
4.  Concrete and stucco may be appropriate for some buildings, if approved by the HPC. 
d.  Decorative elements on building facades shall be of materials appropriate to the building style and similar to materials used on existing historic buildings, including metal, wood, stone, polished stone, tile, or glass block. 
e.  Additional materials may be appropriate on side or rear facades that are less visible from the street, where permitted by the HPC. Materials that may be considered include: 
1.  Precast concrete units and concrete block, provided that surfaces are molded, serrated or treated with a textured material in order to give the wall surface a three-dimensional character. 
2.  "Jumbo brick" units shall only be used on the lower third of the building wall. 
3.  Split-faced brick or block is not acceptable for downtown buildings. 
4.  "Novabrick" may be acceptable in some uses. 
(5)  Windows and doors . Most windows within the District have a vertical orientation, with proportions of two or three to one (height to width); some windows are even narrower (four to one proportions). 
a.  The proportion, size, rhythm and detailing of windows and doors in new construction shall be compatible with that of adjacent buildings. Window and door openings shall comprise at least 30 percent of the area of the ground floor of the primary street façade. 
b.  Windows shall be designed with punched and recessed openings, in order to create a strong rhythm of light and shadow in keeping with traditional architecture. 
c.  Mirrored glass or glass block shall not be used on street-facing facades. Glass on windows and doors shall be clear or slightly tinted, allowing views into and out of the interior. 
d.  Internal window divisions shall be consistent with those of surrounding traditional buildings, or with established styles within the District. Replacement windows consisting of one undivided pane of glass are not appropriate unless approved by the HPC. 
e.  Buildings with modern curtain walls of windows are not appropriate in the District unless approved by the HPC. 
(6)  Accessory buildings . 
a.  Design of accessory buildings should be simple and unobtrusive. Materials similar to those of the principal building are encouraged, but lower cost materials may also be appropriate as determined by the HPC. Materials that may be considered include textured precast concrete units, "Novabrick". 
(7)  Franchise architecture . 
a.  Franchise architecture (building design that is trademarked or identified with a particular chain or corporation)is generally discouraged unless it employs a traditional storefront commercial style. Franchises or national chains shall follow the "New Construction" guidelines to create context-sensitive buildings. 
(8)  Screening of rooftop equipment . 
a.  To the extent feasible, rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from adjacent streets and public rights-of-way. 
b.  Rooftop equipment should be screened by the building parapet, or should be located out of view from the ground. 
c.  If rooftop equipment cannot be screened or out of view, the equipment shall be grouped within a single enclosure. This structure shall be set back a distance of 11/2 times its height from any primary façade fronting a public street. Screens shall be of durable, permanent materials (not including wood) that are compatible with the primary building materials. 
(9)  Awnings . 
a.  When used, awnings shall be installed without damaging the building or visually impairing distinctive architectural features. 
b.  Canvas or fabric awnings shall be used, rather than wood or metal. Vinyl awnings are prohibited unless approved by the HPC. 
c.  Awnings shall be flat rather than curved in profile unless approved by the HPC. 
d.  Internally illuminated awnings are prohibited. 
e.  Exterior mechanical equipment such as ductwork shall not be located on primary building facades. 
(g)  Site design and miscellaneous provisions . Site design occurs within the boundaries of a parcel, between the building and the street or alley that borders it. On many downtown blocks, buildings only have rear yards - their front facades meet the sidewalk and they share party walls with the building on either side. In other locations, a side yard is used for parking, or the side walls of buildings abut an alley entrance or walkway. 
(1)  Rear facades and entrances . Rear entrances, typically from alleys, are often overlooked and neglected. As alleys are improved into attractive pedestrian and service corridors, rear entrances should also be improved, both to improve customer access from parking areas and increase pedestrian circulation throughout the downtown district. 
a.  Rear facades shall be well maintained and welcoming in appearance. 
b.  Landscaping and small wall signs identifying businesses are encouraged.

d.  If a rear entrance is provided, an awning is also encouraged. 
1.  Rear façade materials may be more modest than those used on front facades (see above under "materials") but shall be maintained in good repair. 
2.  Temporary repairs such as the use of plywood or metal to cover windows or openings must be reviewed by the HPC, who may require use of alternative materials. Temporary repairs are defined as repairs that may be in place for a time period of not more than six months.

Consolidation of trash storage to create common screened areas is strongly encouraged. 
(5)  Landscaping and lighting . Landscaping and lighting on private properties shall complement the public streetscape improvements already in place within the Historic District. 
(6)  Signs . In historic commercial buildings, signs were typically mounted above storefronts flush with the façade, or projected perpendicularly from the façade.

(4)  Upon receipt of all necessary information and permit fee, the Department of Planning and Development may request the Wisconsin Department of Children and Familiesto inspect the proposed CLA and review the proposed operation. Approval of the Department may be a condition of approval of the conditional use permit. The same shall apply to any other applicable agency or department, such as the Federal Veterans Administration where appropriate. Comments or reports on the proposed CLA received from such agencies will be considered. The CLA conditional use permit request must confirm compliance with Wis. Admin. Code ch. DCF 57, Wis. Stat. ch. 50, and all other applicable licensing regulations of the Wisconsin Department of Children and Family Services and any other relevant agency, as is appropriate to the facility seeking the conditional use permit. The CLA must confirm compliance with all applicable State and local Housing Building, and Fire Codes. 
(5)  The application will also confirm adequate off-street visitor and employee parking. The City may require more parking than is normally required if special characteristics of the CLA warrant such additional parking. 
(6)  In the business zoning districts, all proposed residential uses are to be above the first floor. 
(7)  There shall be no outdoor signs on or near the facility and the CLA's exterior appearance and proposed operation must be compatible with the surrounding residences when it is in a residential district or surrounding uses when it is in a business or other district.

(10)  The City shall also consider other issues which may have an adverse social, economic, or environmental impact, or effect on the health, safety or welfare of abutting or neighboring properties or the City as a whole. 
(b)  Conditional use review standards. 
(1)  Statement of purpose . The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division of the City into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and size and location of buildings and structures in relation to the use of land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use at a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development, and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses and fall into two categories: 
a.  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest. 
b.  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(2)  The following provisions are established to regulate these conditional uses which require special consideration: 
a.  Standards . No application for a conditional use shall be recommended, approved or granted by the City Plan Commission unless the Commission shall find all of the following: 
1.  That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or welfare. 
2.  That the City will be able to provide municipal services to the property where the conditional use is proposed, given due consideration of the costs of providing such services. 
3.  That the uses, values, and enjoyment of other property in the neighborhood for purposes already established shall be in no foreseeable manner substantially impaired or diminished by the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use. 
4.  That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
5.  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking supply, internal circulation improvements, including but not limited to vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, public transit, and other necessary site improvements have been or are being provided. 
6.  That appropriate measures to address transportation demand have been or will be taken to provide adequate ingress and egress, including all off-site improvements, so designed as to minimize traffic congestion and to ensure public safety and adequate traffic flow, both on-site and on the public streets. 
7.  That the conditional use shall conform to all applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. 
8.  That when applying the above standards to an application by a community living arrangement the City Plan Commission shall: 
i.  Bear in mind the City's general intent to accommodate community living arrangements in applying these criteria. 
ii.  Exercise care to avoid an over-concentration of community living arrangements which could create an institutional setting and seriously strain the existing social structure of the community. Considerations relevant to the determination include: 
A.  The distance separating the proposed community living arrangement from other such facilities. 
B.  The capacity of the community living arrangement and the percentage by which the facility will increase the population of the aldermanic district and/or the City. 
C.  The total capacity of all community living arrangements in the City. 
D.  The impact on the City of other community living arrangements. 
E.  The success or failure of integration into communities or other community living arrangements operated by the individual or group seeking the conditional use permit. 
F.  The ability of the City to meet the special needs, if any, of the applicant facility.

ARTICLE VII. - SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 115-390. - Height and area regulations. 
    The foregoing height and area regulations shall be subject to the following exceptions and regulations: 
(1)  Height . 
a.  On through lots the height of the building may be measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade along the front of the building considering the end facing either street as the front. 
b.  Chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, scenery lofts, monuments, domes, spires, parapet walls, similar structures and necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected to any height in accordance with existing or hereafter adopted ordinances of the City. 
c.  One-family dwellings in the residence district may be increased in height by not more than ten feet when two side yards each not less than 15 feet in width are provided, but no such building shall exceed three stories in height. 
d.  Height of accessory buildings. The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the height and design of accessory buildings or structures. 
1.  The overall maximum vertical distance of detached residential (R1-R6) accessory buildings, excluding carriage house accessory structures, shall not exceed 17 feet from the lowest floor elevation to the highest point of the structure with the overall wall height not to exceed ten feet and the main garage doors not exceeding eight feet in height from the lowest floor elevation. Detached garage roofs shall be framed to a pitch of not less than one-third or four and 12 cut. 
2.  A carriage house accessory structure may exceed 17 feet from the lowest floor elevation to the highest point of the structure only in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The purpose of this subsection is to promote the livability of older neighborhoods by permitting unique designs of accessory buildings that are architecturally compatible with the primary structure. This is to ensure that the proposed accessory structure is in keeping with the historic nature of the primary structure and surrounding properties. Application must be made to and plans must be approved by the Heritage Preservation Commission prior to any building permit being issued under this subsection. 
(i)  In order to exceed 17 feet in height; the primary structure must meet one of the following requirements: 
A.  It is located west of Losey Boulevard to the Mississippi River and north of Green Bay Street to the La Crosse River Marsh. 
B.  It was originally constructed prior to 1930. 
C.  It is potentially eligible, eligible or listed on the National Register of Historic Places, listed on the State Register of Historic Places or locally designated by the City of La Crosse Heritage Preservation Commission. 
(ii)  An applicant must abide by the following submittal process: 
A.  Consultation with City of La Crosse Department of Planning and Development. 
B.  File preliminary plans of the proposed accessory structure with the Heritage Preservation Commission at least 20 days prior to their next regularly scheduled meeting. 
C.  After approval of the preliminary plans by the Heritage Preservation Commission, the applicant must then submit the final plans for such accessory structure for approval by the Heritage Preservation Commission at least 20 days before their next regularly scheduled meeting. Preliminary plans can be approved as final plans if the Heritage Preservation Commission approves them without modifications. 
(iii)  The following design and size requirements shall apply to all accessory structures exceeding the 17 feet height restriction: 
A.  In no case shall an accessory structure exceed the height of the primary structure measured from the ground grade directly adjacent to each structure to the highest point of each structure. 
B.  If the footprint of the primary structure is less than 1,000 square feet; the footprint of the accessory structure shall not exceed 576 square feet (24 feet by 24 feet). If the footprint of the primary structure is more than 1,000 square feet, the footprint of the accessory structure shall not exceed more than 60 percent of the footprint of the primary structure. The design of the accessory structure must be in proper scale for the property and have an appropriate site relation to the primary structure as well as surrounding structures. 
C.  The architecture of the accessory structure shall be historically compatible with the architecture of the primary structure appropriate to the period. The architecture of the accessory structure is not required to match the architecture of the primary structure so long as the architecture is appropriate to the period. 
D.  In no case shall an accessory structure occupy more than 35 percent of the rear yard and shall be setback no less than two feet from the rear and side property lines. This is measured from the roofline. 
E.  Design requirements shall be more restrictive for carriage house accessory structures whose primary structures are on the National Register of Historic Places and shall also incorporate such historic elements such as hardware, which includes door handles, hinges, etc., main garage doors, ornamental decoration, detailed window components and design, detailed roof components and design and materials used for siding. New construction should draw upon the design elements of the historic buildings, while not directly imitating them. 
F.  The value of the carriage house must be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the assessed value of the applicant's primary structure or 30 percent of the average assessed value of all single-family dwellings in the City, whichever is less. This is to ensure compatibility with the existing and surrounding historic properties. Said minimum assessed value requirement may be waived when appropriate. 
(iv)  The Heritage Preservation Commission is authorized to develop all the necessary application forms and design guidelines that applicants must comply with in order to construct a new accessory structure exceeding 17 feet in height. 
3.  In no case shall sanitary plumbing be permitted in an accessory structure. 
(e)  Buildings erected or constructed after July 1, 2002, in the area bounded by Cameron Street, Eighth Street, La Crosse River and Mississippi River within the multiple dwelling, special multiple dwelling, community business, commercial, light industrial, heavy industrial, planned development or public and semi-public district shall have a minimum of two stories in height. City park land and structures thereon within said boundaries shall be exempt from the provisions of this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph may be modified or waived upon application to the Common Council. Applications shall be considered after a public hearing is duly noticed in advance and all property owners within 200 feet have been notified. An application fee in the amount established by resolution must be submitted to the City Clerk's Office at the time of submittal. 
(2)  Area. 
a.  A public or semi-public building, not conducted for profit, need not be provided with a front yard having a depth of more than 20 feet, or a rear yard having a depth of more than ten feet, or with side yards other than those required by this chapter between the building and a street or those required by the chapter between the building and a lot held in a separate ownership, except such yards or other open spaces as may be required by other laws or ordinances. 
b.  A public or semi-public building, not conducted for profit, which is partially or completely destroyed by fire or other uncontrollable cause may be reconstructed on the same portion of the lot which it stood at the time of such fire or other calamity. 
c.  In all residential zoning districts the aggregate building area of all detached accessory buildings shall not exceed 35 percent of the area of the rear yard of the parcel upon which they are to be built, up to a maximum 1,000 square feet of aggregate area of detached accessory buildings; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate area of all residential accessory buildings shall in no case exceed the gross finished floor area of the dwelling unit, excluding unfinished basement areas, to which they are accessory. Such detached residential accessory buildings may be placed in the rear, or side yard when not in conflict with any other requirement of this Code. Detached accessory buildings in the rear yard shall maintain minimum rear yard and side yard setbacks of two feet including roof line. In addition, to the requirements set forth above, a property with a tuck under garage shall be permitted to construct an unattached garage provided that the aggregate area of the two garages do not exceed all of the limits set forth above. The term "tuck under garage" means an attached garage which is built into the footprint of the principle structure and located below a habitable area of the house in its entirety. A garage shall be constructed of similar building materials and shall be similar in appearance as the principal structure. For purposes of this section, a shed no larger than 120 square feet is permitted as an accessory structure but shall also count toward the 35 percent coverage allotment and the 1,000 square foot maximum building footprint. 
d.  Accessory buildings on through lots that extend through from street to street may waive the requirements for a rear yard by furnishing on such through lot, in open space areas other than those required by setback regulations, an equivalent amount of required open rear yard space in lieu of furnishing such required open space in the rear yard. 
e.  Encroachments into required yards . The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the placement of projections and emergency rescue platforms including the design of emergency rescue platforms. The fee to be paid to the City for review of a rescue platform by the Heritage Preservation Commission shall be as established by resolution. Open uncovered handicap access ramps shall be exempt from the yard requirements contained in this subsection, provided a building permit has been issued by the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety and provided further, this exception shall apply only to retrofitting existing residential uses and not for newly constructed residential or commercial structures or uses. 
1.  Every part of a required yard shall be open and unobstructed from its lowest level to the sky, except for the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, chimneys, flues, buttresses, ornamental features, covered stoops, and eaves, provided, however, that none of the aforesaid projections shall project into a required yard or court more than 24 inches and a covered stoop may not project into a required yard or court more than 60 inches. A covered stoop is defined as a structure that is less than 12 square feet in area and is intended to provide ingress and egress to a building. 
2.  Where it is not practicable to install a second internal ingress/egress stairway for a dwelling unit above the first floor, an exterior emergency rescue platform with a landing not to exceed three feet by three feet outside of emergency fire egress windows and doorways, and stairways serving such egress windows and doorways are permitted in the interior side yard setback area and rear yard. Emergency rescue platforms and stairway must be painted, stained or trimmed to match the color scheme of the house and trim so as to blend in with the existing structure. 
3.  Exterior emergency rescue platforms and any stairway serving egress windows and egress doorways shall not be erected on any street side of a building. Any request to construct an emergency rescue platform and/or stairway on a street side shall be heard by the City Heritage Preservation Commission. In order to receive approval by the Heritage Preservation Commission, plans and renderings must be submitted along with a fee in the amount established by resolution to the Commission for their consideration. The plans for the emergency rescue platform and/or on a street side stairway must be accommodated in such fashion so as to appear as part of and consistent with the architecture of the original architecture of the dwelling. Such plans would include, but not be limited to, being painted, stained and trimmed in the same color scheme of the dwelling and should also include such modifications as porches, balustraded balconies, verandas, porticos, pent roofs, black wrought iron galleries, bay windows or other such period additions that might be appropriate. 
4.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 103-328, a window capable for egress onto an adjacent roofline with a cut/pitch of six-twelve or less is a satisfactory substitute for an emergency rescue platform, provided the roofline is four feet or more and the drip edge is not in excess of 15 feet above the grade level. A window leading out to such adjacent roof line and intended to be an emergency egress may be no more than an average of 30 inches from the bottom of the egress window of the subject roof and must have a window sticker denoting the emergency egress window with a Maltese Cross available from the Fire Department at no charge. Egress windows shall also be sufficient egress and acceptable as a second exit onto a landing or rescue platform or staircase, if said landing or rescue platform has guardrails at least 36 inches in height. 
f.  Tunnels or underground passageways between buildings used for residential purpose may be constructed for any lawful purpose. In no event shall any such tunnel, regardless of size, use or intended use cause several otherwise unconnected structures or buildings to be considered a single structure. 
g.  A second garage may be permitted on single-family-zoned residential lots in a Historic District and in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The purpose of this subsection is to promote the livability of historically designated neighborhoods by permitting unique designs of accessory building that are architecturally compatible with the primary structure. Application must be made to and plans must be approved by the Heritage Preservation Commission prior to any building permit being issued under this subsection. 
1.  In order to construct a second garage, the primary structure must be located in an area that is designated as a Historic District by the City or the National Park Service. 
2.  An applicant must abide by the following submittal process. 
(i)  Consultation with the Department of Planning and Development. 
(ii)  File preliminary plans of the proposed accessory structure with the Heritage Preservation Commission at least 20 days prior to their next regularly scheduled meeting along with a fee in the amount established by resolution. 
(iii)  After approval of the preliminary plans by the Heritage Preservation Commission, the applicant must then submit the final plans for such accessory structure for approval by the Heritage Preservation Commission at least 20 days before their next regularly scheduled meeting. Preliminary plans can be approved as final plans if the Heritage Preservation Commission approves them without modifications. 
3.  The following requirements shall apply to all accessory structures acting as a second garage: 
(i)  The value of the second garage must be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the assessed value of the applicant's primary structure or 30 percent of the average assessed value of all single-family dwelling in the City, whichever is less. This is to ensure compatibility with the existing and surrounding historic properties. 
(ii)  In no case shall the second garage exceed the height of the primary structure measured from the ground grade directly adjacent to each structure to the highest point of each structure. 
(iii)  The aggregate square footage of the primary garage and the square footage of the second garage may not exceed 1,200 square feet. On lots greater 15,000 square feet in area, the aggregate of the primary garage and the second garage shall not exceed 1,400 square feet. 
(iv)  The architecture of the second garage shall be historically compatible with the architecture of the primary structure appropriate to the period. The architecture of the accessory structure is not required to match the architecture of the primary structure so long as the architecture is appropriate to the period. 
(v)  In no case shall the second garage occupy more than 35 percent of the rear yard and shall be setback no less than two feet from the rear and side property lines. This is measured from the roofline. 
(vi)  One of the garages needs to be attached to the residential structure. 
4.  The Heritage Preservation Commission is authorized to develop all the necessary application forms and design guidelines with which applicants must comply in order to construct a second garage exceeding 17 feet in height. 
h.  A residential attached or detached garage is permitted on lots of record in the R-1 thru R-6 and Washburn Residential zoning districts that are smaller than 5,000 square feet provided that there is not an existing garage on the lot or parcel. The size of an attached garage cannot be larger than the footprint square footage of the dwelling and a detached garage cannot be larger than 500 square feet. Said garage is required to meet the side yard setbacks under this chapter and cannot be in the front yard setback. There must be a minimum of a four foot rear yard setback for an attached garage and the location of the garage and setbacks must be approved by the City of La Crosse Fire Department. 
(3)  Vision clearance. 
a.  The requirements of vision clearance shall not apply at a height of six feet or more above the highest grade of the adjacent sidewalk or the required sidewalk grade where no sidewalk exists. 
b.  Structures in the vision clearance area which do not now conform with the requirements of this chapter and which existed previous to December 19, 1958, shall be considered as a nonconforming use and shall be governed by provisions of this chapter relating to nonconforming uses. 
c.  Sign supports and other objects of narrow width which do not exceed ten inches in diameter and which do not impair corner vision may, at the discretion of the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety, be permitted in the vision clearance area. 
d.  Trees and objects of natural growth within the vision clearance areas previous to December 19, 1958, shall be permitted to remain. 
e.  Structures or objects of natural growth within the required 15 foot vision clearance areas previous to July 14, 2005, shall be permitted to remain.

Sec. 115-397. - Earth satellite station dish antennas. 
    The unregulated installation and use of earth satellite station dish antennas create a health and safety problem to properties and persons within the City, and the Common Council feels that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the City that the placement of these dish antennas be regulated so as to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the City for the purpose of providing adequate light and air, preventing overcrowding of land, to conserve the value of buildings and encourage the most aesthetic and appropriate use of land throughout the City. Ground-mounted and building-mounted earth satellite station dish antennas are permitted as accessory uses provided that the following applicable requirements are met: 
(1)  Earth satellite station dish antennas shall be constructed and anchored in such a manner to withstand winds of not less than 80 miles per hour and such installations shall be constructed of corrosive-resistant materials. 
(2)  Earth satellite dish antennas shall be filtered and/or shielded so as to prevent the emission or reflection of electromagnetic radiation that would cause any harmful interference with the radio and/or television broadcasting or reception on adjacent properties. In the event that harmful interference is caused subsequent to its installation, the owner of the dish antenna shall promptly take steps to eliminate the harmful interference in accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations. 
(3)  Ground-mounted dish antennas shall meet the height requirements for accessory structures in the zoning district in which they are located. Building-mounted dish antennas shall not exceed the maximum height regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(4)  Earth satellite station dish antennas in the single family residence, residence and multiple dwelling districts shall not exceed ten feet in diameter. 
(5)  Ground-mounted earth satellite station dish antennas shall meet all setback and yard requirements for accessory structures in the district in which they are located; provided, however, in the single family residence, residence and multiple dwelling districts each earth satellite station dish antenna shall be set back at least 25 feet from the front property line. 
(6)  Not more than one earth satellite station dish antenna shall be permitted on a lot or parcel in the single family residence or residence district except that this prohibition shall not apply to zero lot line lots. 
(7)  The installation of an earth satellite station dish antenna shall require a building permit. The property owner, lessor, or installer of any earth satellite station dish antenna shall submit, to the Fire Department - Division of Fire Prevention and Building Safety, plans which indicate the appearance, proposed location and installation method of the dish antenna. A fee in the amount established by resolution shall accompany all applications for a permit. Earth satellite station dish antennas shall be located to minimize their visual impact on surrounding properties. If a property owner in a single family residence, residence or multiple dwelling zoning district proposes a building-mounted antenna location in which the antenna would be visible from the front lot line, that property owner must demonstrate that reception would not be possible from a less conspicuous location. 
(8)  All earth satellite station dish antennas, and the construction and installation thereof, shall conform to applicable City building code and electrical code regulations and requirements. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a building-mounted earth satellite station dish antenna that exceeds six feet in diameter, the applicant shall submit a plan or document prepared by a registered professional engineer which certifies that the proposed dish antenna installation is structurally sound. 
(9)  No advertising messages will be allowed on the dish or framework other than the manufacturer's identification in the single family residence, residence and multiple dwelling districts.

Sec. 115-398. - Fences and hedges. 
(a)  Fences defined. For the purpose of this Section, a "fence" is herein defined as a barrier consisting of vegetation, wood, stone, vinyl, brick, fieldstone, wrought iron, or metal intended to prevent ingress or egress. For the purposed of this section, the term "fence" shall include plantings, such as hedges and shrubbery in the front yard. No fence shall be constructed of unsightly or dangerous materials which would constitute a nuisance. 
(1)  Fences to be situated in side and/or rear yards shall be constructed using materials suitable for residential-style fencing, including, but not limited to, brick, fieldstone, wrought iron, vinyl, chainlink (with a minimum thickness of nine gauge and a required top rail support), stockade or board-on-board wood. With the exception of a fence that sits atop decorative retaining wall or decorative stone wall which is a part of the fence, no fence or fence panels shall be constructed with multiple building materials or more than one pattern of the same materials on any given lot line (for example, a wooden stockade fence cannot be constructed with a wooden picket fence as part of the same fence). This shall not prohibit two intersecting fences from having different materials if the fences are owned by different property owners. 
(2)  No fence shall be constructed of used or discarded materials in disrepair, including, but not limited to, pallets, tree trunks, trash, tires, junk, or other similar items. Materials not specifically manufactured for fencing, such as, but not limited to, railroad ties, doors, landscape timbers or utility poles, shall not be used for, or in the construction of a fence. 
(3)  Agricultural/farm fences shall only be permitted in agriculturally zoned or used districts and can only exceed six feet with a conditional use permit. 
(4)  Fences associated with baseball and/or softball fields and surrounding tennis courts may be erected in conformance with accepted industry standards. A Fence Permit shall be required for such installation.

(b)  Fences categorized. Fences shall be categorized into six classifications: 
(1)  Boundary fence. A fence placed on or within three feet of the property lines of adjacent properties. 
(2)  Protective fence. A fence constructed to enclose a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(3)  Architectural or aesthetic fence. A fence constructed to enhance the appearance of the structure or the landscape. 
(4)  Hedge. A row of bushes or small trees planted close together which may form a barrier, enclosure or boundary in the front yard. 
(5)  Picket fence. A fence having a pointed post, stake, pale or peg laced vertically with the point or sharp part pointing upward to form a part of the fence. 
(6)  Dog kennel fence. A chainlink enclosure which is enclosed on three or four sides in the side or rear yard of a property. 
(c)  Height and setback of fences regulated. 
(1)  Residential fences are permitted up to the property lines in Residential Districts but shall not, in any case, exceed a height of six feet without a conditional use permit, shall not exceed 48 inches in height from grade in the front, side, or rear yard setback abutting a public sidewalk, shall not encroach into any vision corner and shall not be closer than three feet to any public right-of-way along a public alley. The height of any fence shall be measured as an average and shall not include the posts or pillars to which a fence is attached. 
a.  Decorative wrought iron, brick, stone, PVC or painted picket style fences less than 48 inches (average) in height from grade or decorative lot corner landscape may be placed up to the property line in Residential Districts and shall not violate vision corner ordinances pursuant to this section. 
b.  Chainlink and unpainted/unstained fencing is not permitted in residential front, side or rear yards abutting a public sidewalk. 
c.  A fence located in an interior side yard between dwellings shall not exceed four feet in height. However, a fence may be erected to a height of six feet if the entire fence is constructed of wrought iron or similar open construction or if the area above four feet is at least 50 percent open. An example of the latter is a fence that is opaque to a height of four feet and is topped with not more than two feet of lattice. Any interior side-yard fence may be erected to a height of six feet if it is located more than ten feet from the side wall of the adjacent neighboring dwelling. 
d.  A fence located in a rear yard abutting a public sidewalk may be erected to a height of six feet if the entire fence is constructed of wrought iron or similar open construction or if the area above four feet is at least 50 percent open. An example of the latter is a fence that is opaque to a height of four feet and is topped with not more than two feet of lattice. A fence as specified above may be located in a side yard on the street side of a corner lot behind the principal structure. 
e.  All fences must be constructed and maintained in a good state of repair and appearance. The finished side or decorative side of a fence shall face adjoining property. 
f.  Any fences adjacent to or encroaching into alley right-of-way that are required to be removed for construction related causes during a City alley project may be reconstructed within the three-foot setback, provided they are reconstructed outside of the right-of-way using the property line established by the Engineering Department during the project without the requirement of a Certified Survey Map.

Fences are permitted on the property lines in all commercial zoning districts but shall not exceed eight feet in height in commercial zoning districts and ten feet in height for property zoned light or heavy industrial and shall be of an open type similar to woven wire, chainlink or wrought iron fencing. Fences regulated under Section 10-49(2)(b) as part of an approved Beer Garden License are not subject to these restrictions. Solid vinyl or composite fences are only allowed on property lines abutting a residential property, but cannot be taller than six feet. The fence can be up to eight feet tall by a conditional use permit. 
(e)  Prohibited fences. No fence shall be constructed which is in a dangerous condition, or which conducts electricity or is designed to electrically shock or which uses barbed wire; provided, however, that barbed wire may be used in industrially zoned areas if the devices securing the barbed wire to the fence are ten feet above grade and project toward the fenced property and away from public area. 
(1)  No person shall construct or install: 
a.  Any wire or chainlink-type fence with the cut or salvage end of the fence exposed at the top. 
b.  A fence which creates a hazard to users of the street, sidewalk or to nearby property.

e.  Fences to be repaired. All fences shall be maintained and kept safe and in a state of good repair, and the finished side or decorative side of a fence shall face adjoining property. 
f.  Temporary fences. Fences erected for the protection of planting or to warn of construction hazard, or for similar purposes, shall be clearly visible or marked with colored streamers or other such warning devices at four foot intervals. Such fence shall comply with the setback requirements set forth in this section. The issuance of a permit shall not be necessary for temporary fences as described herein, but said fences shall not be erected for more than 45 days or, in the case of a construction project, shall only be for the duration of said construction project. 
g.  Nonconforming fences and hedges. Any fence or hedge existing on the effective date of this Code of Ordinances shall not be modified, enlarged, extended or replaced, except in strict compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter. The replacement of a nonconforming fence as to height, setbacks (vision corner requirements shall still be met), or fence material type may be made provided that the fence material be the same or higher grade as outlined below: 
Ascending order of fence types: 
1.  Chainlink.

    The following standards were established to improve the appearance, quality, and functions of multifamily housing and shall apply in the following zoning districts: Washburn Residential District, R-2 District through R-6 District, Traditional Neighborhood District, and Planned Development District in La Crosse. These standards shall apply to newly constructed buildings renovations exceeding 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure (at the time of reconstruction/renovation), all multifamily housing that is moved to vacant lots, and additions. The property owner of an existing non multifamily structure that is being remodeled or renovated for use as a multifamily housing building shall meet the requirements of this section and obtain Development Review Committee approval for building design and site plans as a condition of obtaining any rezoning or building permit. These regulations shall not apply to owner-occupied zero lot line "twindominium" units that have been approved by the Common Council as part of a developer's agreement or Planned Development District rezoning so long as the lot split was completed prior to issuance of a building permit. This regulations shall not apply to building renovations using the Secretary of Interior Standards for historic buildings; the standards contained in this section shall supersede all other City of La Crosse ordinances as the relate to multifamily development, and if there is conflict, this article shall control, unless specifically stated. 
(Code 1980, § 15.46(A)) 
Sec. 115-511. - Review procedures. 
(a)  These design standards will be administered as part of the building permit process, and documents required by these standards must be submitted to the Department of Planning and Development. A pre-application meeting with the Department of Planning and Development staff is required prior to submittal for the purpose of reviewing the requirements of this article.

(Code 1980, § 15.46(B)) 
Sec. 115-512. - Parking lot design and parking standards. 
(a)  Intent to minimize the visual impact of parking areas as seen from the living units, from adjacent properties, and from the street; to enhance pedestrian access, circulation and safety by reducing curb cuts and driveways that cut across sidewalks; to minimize the volume and maximize the quality of stormwater runoff; to provide adequate but not excessive parking for residents; to prohibit the use of satellite parking lots; to prohibit parking in side or front yards; to provide the adequate snow storage; to discourage the reliance on single occupant vehicles (SOVs); to encourage the use of mass transit and other alternative means of transportation; to reduce the reliance on petroleum based or reliant paving materials and methods; and to parking lots due to lack of any trees or plants. 
(b)  No parking stall may be closer to the street than the building setback line or the building on same parcel, whichever is further from the street. This provision may be waived for duplex structures where alley access is not present. 
(c)  Properties served by an alley will not be allowed a driveway connecting to the street. 
(d)  Parking areas shall be separated from primary buildings by a landscaped buffer at least 15 feet in width. 
(e)  Minimum setback for parking stalls and drives is five feet from all property lines and that setback must be green space. A five-foot green space buffer along the rear lot line adjacent to an alley is not required; however, the side yard five foot green space buffer shall extend all the way to the alley. Parking for adjacent properties may be combined into continuous pave lots, eliminating the required setback at the shared property line, provided that 100 percent of the lost green space is replaced elsewhere on the parcel (e.g., with a ten-foot setback along the opposite lot line). 
(f)  A parking lot for more than 12 vehicles shall incorporate at least 288 square feet of planting islands at least eight feet in width (face of curb to face of curb). Planting islands may be either parallel to the parking spaces or perpendicular to the parking spaces. As parking lot size increase, and additional planting island is required at the ration of one planting island for every 20 automobile parking spaces. 
(g)  As an alternative to the prescriptive requirements of subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section, development under this division may be allowed to cluster the landscaped buffers, green space, and planting islands where the total of this space shall be a minimum of 15 percent of the lot area and must be located in the rear yard. In no case shall any of the lot area in the front yard setback or side yard setbacks be used when using this alternative. This provision does not apply to section 115-515 for outdoor recreation space and shall not be counted in the 15 percent or 20 percent respectively; however, that outdoor recreation space may be added to the buffers, green space, and planting islands. 
(h)  Buffers, setbacks, and planting islands may be used for stormwater infiltration. See the stormwater standards for infiltration requirements. 
(i)  All drives, parking, and vehicular circulation areas shall be paved and graded for proper stormwater management. Lots shall utilize concrete curb and gutter to direct stormwater and protect landscaping except for lots fewer than eight spaces. The use of pervious pavement for stormwater infiltration is highly encouraged. For duplexes where no alley exists and parking is therefore permitted in the front of the building, curb and gutter are not required. 
(j)  The minimum off-street parking requirement for all multifamily housing is one space per bedroom. 
(k)  Parking spaces shall not be less than 8.5 feet in width and 17 feet in length. The full dimensions of this rectangle must be maintained in angled parking designs. 
(l)  Drive aisle widths vary depending upon the angle of park; the following minimum standards apply: 
(1)  45 degrees: 12 foot, ten inch aisle. 
(2)  55 degrees: 13 foot seven inch aisle. 
(3)  65 degrees: 15 foot four inch aisle. 
(4)  75 degrees: 17 foot ten inch aisle. 
(5)  90 degrees: 22 foot aisle. 
(m)  Parking lots shall be permitted to be increased in size by no more than five percent, provided at least 25 percent of the parking lot and pedestrian sidewalks consist of paving blocks (plastic or concrete honeycomb grid) planted with grass. 
(n)  Parking lots shall be located on the same lot as the principle structure. 
(o)  Raised curbs, parking blocks or stops, decorative bollards and/or fences, trees and/or shrubs shall be utilized along the edge or parking lots to prevent motor vehicles from being parked on green space buffer, outdoor recreation space, bike parking areas, sidewalks and side and front yards. In the event the original protective measures are inadequate to preventing inappropriate parking, additional measures shall be taken. 
(p)  Parking lot snow storage area(s). 
(1)  Parking lot snow storage area(s) shall be designated in the parking lot and/or green space buffers. 
(2)  Snow storage shall not be allowed in the required outdoor recreation space. 
(3)  Snow storage areas shall not be located near parking lot entrances and impede driver vision near, or cause melting snow or ice to drain onto sidewalks or into neighboring properties. 
(4)  If these green space buffer(s) are no longer capable of storing snow, the property owners shall arrange for the excess snow to be removed. 
(q)  Light-colored and/or reflective surface coatings should be considered to reduce the "heat island" effect of traditional asphalt parking lots. 
(r)  Low-impact paving materials and methods that utilize non-petroleum-based (or reliant paving systems) to reduce smog-forming emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are encouraged. 
(s)  Porous paving materials (paving blocks with decorative grave, or properly spaced cobbles, brick, and natural stone with grass planted in between in small clusters) and methods that reduce stormwater runoff are encouraged. 
(t)  The provisions of section 115-393 that are superseded by this section are as follows: (f), (i), (k) and the portion of subsection (j) that reads as follows: "Required off-street parking space, including access drives and off-street parking space, including access drives and aisles, shall not cover more than 75 percent of the lot area in which such off-street parking space is permitted." 
(u)  Parallel parking, also known as stacked parking, is prohibited when determining the layout of off-street parking spaces in the off-street parking lot. Parallel parking is defined as a method of parking a vehicle in a parallel line, with one vehicle in the back of another vehicle with the front bumper of each vehicle facing the back bumper of the other vehicle. 
(Code 1980, § 15.46(C)) 
Sec. 115-513. - Pedestrian circulation. 
(a)  The intent of this section is to promote resident safety and comfort by providing adequate and convenient pedestrian access to and from and within the site. 
(b)  There shall be a paved pedestrian route from the sidewalk or street to the main building entrance, and from the parking area to the nearest building entrance. Buildings with more than one entrance shall provide a designated pedestrian route between those entrances (e.g., from front to back). Routes of the entrances (e.g., between patio doors and the parking lot, or around corners) should be anticipated and either paved for use or obstructed by landscape features to prevent use. 
(c)  Pedestrian routes shall be paved with concrete or other approved material. Asphalt or similar bituminous material shall not be allowed for pedestrian routes. 
(d)  Porous paving materials (paving blocks with decorative gravel, or properly spaces cobbles, brick, and natural stone with grass planted in between in small clusters) and methods that reduces stormwater runoff are encouraged. 
(Code 1980, § 15.46(D)) 
Sec. 115-514. - Building mechanics service elements and resident amenities. 
(a)  The intent of this section is to minimize the negative visual impacts of service elements on adjoining streets, public spaces and adjacent properties; to minimize noise, odor, and litter; and to provide adequate amenities for residents of rental housing. 
(b)  The design and location of the following items shall be indicated on building and/or site plans, illustrated with spec sheets as appropriate, and submitted with the design standards checklist: 
(1)  Utility mechanicals. 
(2)  Building mechanicals. 
(3)  Trash and recycling containers. 
(4)  Bicycle parking. 
(c)  Service areas, utility meters, and building mechanical shall not be located on the street side of the building, nor on a side wall closer than ten feet to the street side of the building. Screening of meters and mechanicals is encouraged, regardless of location. Cable, conduit and phone lines shall not be visible on the exterior with the exception of conduit running directly to the meter/utility boxes at the time of initial occupancy. After occupancy, every effort should be made to minimize such exterior add-ons. 
(d)  Trash and recycling containers, including cans and dumpsters, shall have covers and be screened so as not to be visible from the street or from neighboring properties. Screening shall be one foot higher than the container but no higher than six feet; however, roofed enclosures may exceed this limit. 
(e)  Every building entrance that services more than two units should feature one covered trash can with at least a 15-gallon capacity and designed as a decorative outdoor trash can and one smoking materials receptacle, or combination thereof designed for the safe disposal of smoking materials. If located at an entrance that faces a public street, these receptacles shall be screened from view and/or designed to fit with the architecture and materials of the building. 
(f)  Location of heating and cooling appliances. 
(1)  Heating appliances such as furnaces and hot water heaters shall be located inside the building, preferably in a walk-in basement or utility room. 
(2)  High energy gas appliances shall have the air intakes and exhaust vents located on the sides or rear of the building where they do not interfere with any sidewalks, are no likely to be blocked or damaged by pedestrian traffic, snow or the removal of snow, and away from any trees or shrubs that would be harmed by the exhaust heat and gases. 
(3)  Window-mounted air conditioners shall not be permitted in any window facing the street. 
(4)  "Magic-Pac" air conditioner/heat pump units are preferred on street facing facades. 
(5)  When located in a wall facing the street, wall mounted air conditioners shall be masked and blend in with the exterior siding and finishes. Masking techniques can include casing to match the exterior or by limiting the amount of protrusion from the wall. 
(6)  If heat pumps or air conditioners are located on the ground, they shall be on one side or the rear of the building and screened with evergreens or decorative screening that matches or compliments the exterior siding of the building, such that proper clearances are maintained for the manufacturer's warranty. 
(7)  If heat pumps or air conditioners are located on the roof, they shall be on one side or the rear of the building and screened with decorative screening that matches or compliments the exterior siding of the building. 
(g)  Bicycle parking. 
(1)  Bike parking shall be provided at one space per three bedrooms. 
(2)  Bicycle parking (to accommodate four bicycles) shall be nominally at least nine by six feet or 54 square feet and increase by the same ratio to accommodate the number of bike spaces. 
(3)  In exterior applications ribbon racks or bike racks specifically designed for bike parking are required. 
(4)  In exterior applications bike parking areas should be located inside the building or near building entries and shall not be permitted in the front yard, shall not interfere with pedestrian circulation, and shall be well-lit. 
(5)  If the area for bike parking is designed using standards provided in section 115-516, then the up to 100 percent of the space taken for the bike parking shall count as buffer green space but not as outdoor recreation space. 
(6)  Bikes are not permitted to be stored, locked, or chained on decks, patios, fences or other exterior location other than a bike rack specifically designed for bike parking. 
(7)  The base for bike racks should be concrete to endure their stability; however, the remaining bicycle parking area shall be porous paving materials (paving blocks with decorative gravel or wood mulch, or properly spaced cobbles, brick, and natural stone with grass planted in between in small clusters) to reduce stormwater runoff.

(a)  The intent of this section is to promote quality in landscape design and to mitigate undesirable views; to create inviting and usable open spaces around which building are organized and that promote a sense of security and community to provide pleasant and safe pedestrian circulation; and to provide shad and cool the building and outdoor recreational space. The following standards apply: 
(1)  A landscape design and planting plan shall be developed for all building and for buildings with four or more units or with a ground floor area(s) in excess of 10,000 square feet this plan shall be stamped by a registered landscape architect prior to submittal to the City. The plan shall address all parts of the parcel and shall indicate all planned parts landscape materials and their location, minimum size, quantity, and maintenance requirements. 
(2)  All portions of the site not covered by buildings, paving material, or other planned and approved surfaces shall be considered "landscaped area" and shall be planted with living plant materials and/or mulches. Overall site landscaping shall include not less than: 
a.  One shade tree per 40 linear feet of lot frontage; 
b.  One tree placed in the boulevard per 40 linear feet of lot frontage; and 
c.  Not less than one tree and ten shrubs per 610 square feet of landscaped area. 
(Example: A 60 foot lot with 2,200 square feet of unpaved surfaces requires one boulevard tree, one shade tree, three additional shade or ornamental trees, and 30 shrubs.) 
(b)  All plant material used shall meet the minimum standards established by the American Association of Nurserymen as published in the American Standards for Nursery Stack and shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
(1)  Deciduous trees: three inches dbh (diameter at breast height). 
(2)  Ornamental trees: two inches dbh. 
(3)  Evergreen trees: five feet height. 
(4)  Shrubs: five-gallon container. 
(5)  Vines and perennials: one-gallon container. 
(c)  Boulevard trees will be supplied by the City Forester if requested and shall conform and shall conform to City of La Crosse street tree standards.

The above street tree species are also recommended for any tree planted within ten feet of a driveway or parking area. 
(d)  Prohibited trees: poplar, box elder, catalpa, mountain ash, willows, birch, conifers, hackberry, and elm. 
(e)  Existing healthy trees should be preserved to the greatest extent practicable; however, invasive or nuisance trees shall be removed. Existing damaged, decayed, or diseased trees should be removed to protect remaining trees. Construction near existing trees should follow Best Management Practices to ensure their survival. 
(f)  Landscaping should reinforce pedestrian circulation routes and obstruct undesired routes of convenience. Bushes, trees, rocks, and other landscape features should be used to indicate where pedestrians should and should not travel. 
(g)  Where visible from the street and within 50 feet of the right-of-way, parking areas shall be screened by a continuous row of shrubs or natural landscape screening technique that will reach a maximum height of 36 inches within two years from planting. Shrubs or hedges taller than 36 inches are strongly discouraged for safety reasons. 
(h)  Each multifamily site shall include a minimum of 200 square feet of outdoor recreational space at ground level suitable for outdoor recreation (grilling, sitting, sunbathing, playing catch, etc.). For multifamily sites with more than two units, the outdoor recreational space shall increase by 25 square feet per bedroom (e.g. four units with four bedrooms each yields 200 square feet plus 25 square feet times eight yields another 200 square feet for a total of 400 square feet. This area may be divided into multiple distinct spaces, but no single outdoor recreational space may be smaller than 100 square feet nor narrower than eight feet in any direction. No area in the front yard or side yard setbacks will be counted toward the total outdoor recreational space. Outdoor recreation space immediately adjacent to parking stall is discouraged, and in a two foot buffer around the parking stall measured form the face of the curb) will not be counted toward the total outdoor recreation space. Areas used for stormwater infiltration or bike parking or garbage and recycling receptacles or heat pumps or air conditioners will not be counter toward the required outdoor recreation space. 
(i)  Buildings shall be organized in relation to open spaces such as yards and courts to create a balance of useable open space and efficient circulation and parking. This standard shall not override the establishment of an orderly, positive, and urban character of the relationship of building to streets.

(Code 1980, § 15.47(B)) 
Sec. 115-550. - Parking lot design and parking standards. 
(a)  The intent of this section is to follow "New Urbanist" principles where buildings are strongly encouraged to be placed close to the street to enhance customer and tenant use of mass transit and to reinforce the existing building setback pattern; to minimize the visual impact of parking areas as seen from the street; to enhance pedestrian access, circulation and safety by reducing curb cuts and approaches that cut across sidewalks; to minimize the volume and maximize the quality of stormwater runoff; to provide adequate but not excessive parking for customers and tenants; to prohibit the use of satellite parking lots (unless it can be demonstrated that shared parking will be beneficial to multiple property owners and does not result in "gap tooth" effect on a block face); to prohibit parking in side or front yards to provide for adequate snow storage; to discourage the reliance on single occupant vehicles (SOVs); to encourage the use of mass transit and other alternative means of transportation; to reduce the reliance on petroleum based paving materials and methods; and to reduce the "heat island" effect of traditional paved parking lots due to lack of trees or plants. 
(b)  No parking stall may be closer to the street that the building setback line or the building on the same parcel, whichever is further from the street unless the applicant can demonstrate that there are no practical alternatives related specifically to the site. 
(c)  All points of ingress and egress will be evaluated by the City Traffic Engineer to determine if ingress and egress should be allowed directly to the street or via an alley. 
(d)  Parking areas shall be separated from primary buildings by a landscaped buffer. 
(e)  Minimum setback for parking stalls and drives is five feet from all property lines with the exception of the alley (in order to accommodate landscaping or drainage swales). Parking for adjacent properties may be combined into continuous paved lots, eliminating the required setback at the shared property line, provided that 100 percent of the lost green space is replaced elsewhere on the parcel (e.g. with a ten-foot setback along the opposite lot line).
