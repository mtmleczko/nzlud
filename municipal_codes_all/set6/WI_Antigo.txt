/s/ Kaye M. Matucheski 
      City Clerk-Treasurer   PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Antigo, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code, as supplemented through November 9, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

OPEN MEETING LAW GUIDE [1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the open meeting law guide of the city. The statutory cites were revised to the standard citation format used in the Code. 

[Sec. 1.] - General Requirements 
1.  Wisconsin's Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental bodies shall be open to all citizens at all times. Wis. Stats. § 19.81(2). 
2.  Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in places reasonably accessible to the public. 
3.  Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically provided otherwise by law. 
4.  When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to compose a quorum, that meeting is presumed to be convened for the purpose of conducting official business. Such a meeting is in violation of The Open Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the meeting is not open to the public. Wis. Stats. § 19.82(2). 
5.  The Open Meeting Law also applies when members of a governing body, or committee thereof, engage in business of that body and when the number of members present is potentially sufficient to determine the governing body's course of action regarding the proposal discussed [ State vs. Showers, No. 85-471 (June 15, 1987)]. 
[Sec. 2.] - Public Notice 
1.  WHO MUST RECEIVE NOTICE. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her designee, shall give notice to the official newspaper and to any other members of the news media who have filed a written request to receive such notices, or if neither exists, in a manner likely to give notice to the public. Notice must also be given as required by statute. 
2.  CONSTRUCTION OF NOTICE. The notice for the meeting shall include: 
a.  The time, date and place of the meeting, and 
b.  The subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered in closed session. 
The governmental body may discuss and, if urgent, act upon matters which were not specifically referred to in the agenda where the agenda contains a general item, such as "miscellaneous business." Where the presiding officer has specific knowledge that matters may come before the body, they should be included on the agenda. 
3.  TIME FOR NOTICE. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the commencement of the meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in which case shorter notice may be given. In no case may notice be provided less than two (2) hours in advance of the meeting. Wis. Stats. § 19.84(3). 
4.  COMMITTEES AND SUBUNITS EXEMPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. A legally constituted subunit of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of the governing body's meeting or immediately after the lawful meeting to act or deliberate upon a matter which was the subject of that meeting. For this exemption to apply, the presiding officer must publicly announce the time, place and subject matter of the subunit's meeting in advance of the meeting of the governing body. 
[Sec. 3.] - Procedure For Closed Sessions 
1.  Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee knows that a closed session is being contemplated. Notice is required regardless of whether a majority of members will or will not support going into closed session at the meeting. Wis. Stats. § 19.84(2). 
2.  After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, a motion made and recorded, supported by majority vote, is required to close, with the vote of each member recorded in the minutes. Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1). 
3.  If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall announce to those present at the meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the nature of the business to be considered in the closed session and the specific exemption(s) relied upon in Wis. Stats. § 19.85, under which the closed session is permitted. 
4.  Only matters contained in the presiding officer's announcement of the closed session may be considered during the closed session. 
5.  An open session, with adequate notice, must precede a closed session, even where it was decided at a prior open session to go into a closed session at a subsequent meeting. 
[Sec. 4.] - Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions 
1.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(a), creates an exemption for governmental bodies deliberating after quasi-judicial trials or hearings. However, boards of review cannot rely on this exemption for Wis. Stats. § 70.47(2m) requires all board of review meetings to be held in open session. 
2.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(b) is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law allowing the use of a closed session when a governmental body is considering the demotion, dismissal, licensing, discipline or tenure of a public employee or a person licensed by a board or commission. This exception permits preliminary discussion and investigation without the necessity of providing actual notice to the individual involved. However, before any evidentiary hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must be given to the person involved so that he or she can exercise his or her right to request an open session for those purposes. 
3.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(c) sanctions the use of closed sessions where governmental bodies are considering employment, promotion, compensation or performance evaluation of any public employee. Governmental bodies should exercise caution when considering performance to avoid discussing matters that are covered by Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(b). 
4.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(c) permits the use of closed sessions when applications for parole or probation are being considered, or when crime detection or prevention strategy is to be discussed. 
5.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(e) allows closed sessions for the purpose of deliberating or negotiating the purchase of public properties, the investing of public funds, for the conducting of other specified public business, as long as competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed session. Under this exception, a governmental body could meet in closed session for the purpose of forming negotiation strategies, although the body must give notice that an open session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to convene in closed session for the purpose of discussing labor negotiation strategies. 
6.  Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if conducted in public, would have a "substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to" may be held in closed session under Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(f). However, this exemption is unavailable where Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(b) is applicable. 
7.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(g) allows a governmental body to confer with its legal counsel in closed session for the purpose of obtaining oral or written advice concerning strategy to be adopted by the body with respect to present and prospective litigation directly involving the governmental body. 
8.  Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for confidential written advice from ethics boards under Wis. Stats. § 19.85(1)(h). 
[Sec. 5.] - Limitations on Closed Sessions 
1.  Wis. Stats. § 19.85(2) makes it impermissible for a governmental body to reconvene in open session within twelve (12) hours after a closed session, unless public notice of the subsequent open session was given at the same time and in the same manner as was required for the original open session. 
2.  Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required to be in open session under Wis. Stats. § 19.85(3). However, a governmental body can vote to preliminarily approve bargaining proposals in closed session, in order to reach a consensus, as long as final ratification occurs in open session. 
[Sec. 6.] - Ballots, Votes and Records 
1.  Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a governmental body to determine any election or decision, except the election of the officers of such body. This narrow exception does not permit the use of secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers of the governmental units such as department heads or fill vacancies on the body itself. 
2.  Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote. 
3.  Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public inspection. 
[Sec. 7.] - Use of Equipment in Meetings 
1.  A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media's equipment. 
2.  Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided that the use of this equipment does not interfere with the conduct of the meeting(s). 
3.  A member of a governmental body does not have the right to tape record a closed session of the common council.

(1)  Generally. With the exception of franchise ordinances as provided below, an ordinance may be put to its final passage on the same day on which it was introduced.

Printed copies shall be made available for review upon request to any person attending a council meeting.

By affirmative motion, the council may assign the proposed ordinance to a specific committee for study and consideration. The committee shall report its findings to the council. 
(5)  Passage. If a motion to pass an ordinance fails, the ordinance shall be considered lost. 
(6)  Amendments. Any ordinance amending or repealing any portion of the Antigo Municipal Code shall also amend or repeal the respective portions of any underlying ordinance(s).

ARTICLE V. - ETHICS AND EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS 

Sec. 2-731. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established in this article a code of ethics for all city officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions of the city, as well as any individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the city. 
(b)  The purpose of the ethics code in this article is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The common council believes that a code of ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this city in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The common council reaffirms that each elected and appointed city official and employee holds his/her position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust. The sections and purpose of the ethics code in this article and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city.

(3)  Any nonelected official who has a financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislative action of the common council or any board, commission or committee upon which the official has any influence or input or of which the official is a member that is to make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the subject of the proposed legislative action shall disclose on the records of the common council or the appropriate board, commission or committee the nature and extent of such interest. Such official shall not participate in debate or discussion or vote for adoption or defeat of such legislation. 
(4)  Any city employee who has a financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislative action of the common council or any board, commission or committee upon which the employee has any influence or input or of which the employee is a member that is to make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the subject of the proposed legislative action shall disclose on the records of the common council or the appropriate board, commission or committee the nature and extent of such interest. 
(b)  Disclosure of confidential information. No official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the city, nor shall such information be used to advance the financial or other private interests of the official or employee or others. 
(c)  Gifts and favors. 
(1)  No official or employee, personally or through a member of his/her immediate family, may solicit or accept, either directly or indirectly, from any person or organization, money or anything of value if it could be expected to influence the employee's official actions or judgments or be considered a reward for any action or inaction on the part of the official or employee. 
(2)  No official or employee personally or through a member of his/her immediate family shall accept any gift, whether in the form of money, service, loan, thing or promise, from any person which could reasonably be expected to impair his/her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his/her duties or grant in the discharge of his/her duties any improper favor, service or thing of value. However, it is not a conflict of interest for any public official or employee to receive hospitality that is unsolicited and unrelated to government business, such as a meal, and that is not intended to influence the official. 
(3)  An official or employee is not to accept hospitality if, after consideration of the surrounding circumstances, it could reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would not be extended were it not for the fact that the guest or a member of the guest's immediate family was a city official or employee. Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. This subsection further shall not be construed to prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality, as a properly reported political contribution, from citizens for the purpose of supporting the candidate's campaign. The state ethics board has interpreted "hospitality" as it applies to state officials as including meals, beverages and lodging which a person offers at his/her residence and would have been uttered if the recipient was not an official. 
(4)  Gifts received by an official or employee or his/her immediate family under unusual circumstances shall be referred to the common council within ten days of receipt for recommended disposition. Any person subject to this article who becomes aware that he/she is or has been offered any gift, the acceptance of which would constitute a violation of this subsection, shall, within ten days, disclose the details surrounding the offer to the common council. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement shall constitute an offense under this article. 
(d)  Representing private interests before city agencies or courts. 
(1)  Nonelected city officials and employees shall not appear on behalf of any private person, other than himself/herself, his/her spouse or minor children, before any city agency, board, commission or the common council if the official or employee or any board, commission or committee of which the official or employee is a member has any jurisdiction, discretion or control over the matter which is the subject of such representation. 
(2)  Elected city officials may appear before city agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of their duties as representatives of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations. However, the disclosure requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall be applicable to such appearances. 
(e)  Ad hoc committee exceptions. No violation of the conflict of interest restrictions of this section shall exist, however, where an individual serves on a special ad hoc committee charged with the narrow responsibility of addressing a specific issue or topic in which that individual or the employer or a client of that individual has an interest so long as the individual discloses to the common council that such interest exists. 
(f)  Contracts with city. No city official or employee who, in his/her capacity as such officer or employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he/she has a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring the exercise of discretion on his/her part shall enter into any contract with the city unless, within the confines of Wis. Stats. § 946.13, the contract is awarded through a process of public notice and competitive bidding or the common council waives the requirement of this section after determining that it is in the best interest of the city to do so. This subsection shall not apply to the designation of a public depository of public funds. 
(g)  Campaign contributions. Campaign contributions shall be reported by all candidates for city office in strict conformity with the provisions of statute. Any campaign contribution tendered to or accepted by a candidate subsequent to the final statutory report shall be reported to the common council. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-7) 
Sec. 2-738. - Advisory opinions. 
    When a city official or employee has doubt as to the applicability of a section of the ethics code in this article to a particular situation or definition of terms used in this article, he/she should apply to the personnel committee, which may ask the city attorney for an advisory opinion and will be guided by that opinion when given. The official or employee shall have the opportunity to present his/her interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicability of sections of this article before such advisory decision is made. This article shall be operative in all instances covered by its provisions except when superseded by an applicable statutory provision and statutory action is mandatory or when the application of a statutory provision is discretionary, but determined by the city attorney to be more appropriate or desirable. Advisory requests and opinions shall be kept confidential, except when disclosure is authorized by the requestor, in which case the request and opinion may be made public. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-8) 
Sec. 2-739. - Hiring relatives. 
(a)  This section governs the proposed hiring of individuals for full-time or part-time work as city employees who are members of the immediate family of city employees or elected officials. The term "immediate family" includes those relatives by blood or marriage defined as "personal interests," as that term is defined in section 2-732. 
(b)  Hiring an immediate family member of any current city employee or elected city official will be considered only if that individual has the knowledge and skills, experience or other job-related qualifications that warrant consideration for the position. A person cannot be hired for either full-time or part-time employment in a position immediately supervised by a member of that person's immediate family. 
(c)  This section does not apply to nonelected officials who are asked to accept appointment as members of a city board, commission or committee; nonelected officials, however, will be expected to disqualify themselves from participation in matters under consideration which may affect the hiring, retention, classification or compensation of their immediate family if currently employed or being considered for employment by the city. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-9) 
Sec. 2-740. - Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
    If an employee, covered under a collective bargaining agreement is allegedly involved in an ethics code violation, the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement shall prevail in the administration and interpretation of the ethics code in this article. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-10) 
Sec. 2-741. - Sanctions. 
(a)  Upon the written complaint of any person alleging facts which, if true, would constitute improper conduct under this article, the common council shall conduct an investigation of the facts of the complaint. If the investigation indicates there may be a reasonable basis for the complaint justifying further investigation, the common council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the common law requirements of due process, including notice, an opportunity to be heard, an opportunity to cross examine witnesses and to present testimony and other evidence in support of the accused's position and an opportunity to be represented by counsel or other representative at the expense of the accused. The council shall make written findings of fact and issue a written decision concerning the propriety of the conduct of the subject official or employee. 
(b)  A determination that a public official's or public employee's actions constitute improper conduct under this article may constitute a cause for removal from office, termination of employment, suspension, reprimand, removal from committee assignment, or other appropriate disciplinary action. As an alternative or in addition to sanctions imposed in this section, any individual violating the ethics code in this article shall be subject to a nonreimbursable forfeiture of not less than $10.00 nor more than $200.00 as determined by the common council. 
(c)  Sanctions, including any disciplinary action, that may affect employees covered under a labor agreement will be consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the labor agreement. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-11)

CITY OF ANTIGO 
DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE 
EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION STATEMENT 
On November 18, 1988, Congress passed, as part of the omnibus drug legislation, the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D). This statute requires grantees of federal agencies to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces. Making the required certification is a precondition for receiving a grant from a federal agency. On January 31, 1989, an interim rule on these requirements was published in the Federal Register (54 FR 4946 and 4956). This rule was effective March 18, 1989. 
The City of Antigo hereby notifies all persons employed by the City that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the City of Antigo's workplace. 
Violation(s) of this prohibition will result in suspension from work without pay, possible demotion, or termination, or, the individual may be required to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by the City of Antigo. 
As part of the City's Drug-Free Workplace program, all employees will receive information about the following: 
1.  The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace; 
2.  The city's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace; 
3.  Information regarding available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and 
4.  The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace. 
As a condition of employment with the City of Antigo, all employees will do the following: 
1.  Abide by the terms of this statement; and 
2.  Notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-12, appendix) 
Sec. 2-743. - Salaries.

State Law reference- Compensation generally, Wis. Stats. § 66.0505. 
Sec. 2-744. - Equal employment policy and complaint procedure. 
(a)  Equal employment policy. The city provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race; color; religion; sex; national origin; age; handicap/disability; marital status; ancestry; arrest record; conviction record; or membership in the national guard, state defense force or any reserve component of the military forces of the United States or this state in accordance with the applicable state and federal laws. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation and training. In addition, the city complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment. The city expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital status, arrest or conviction record or handicap. Improper interference with the ability of the city's employees to perform their expected job duties is not tolerated. 
(b)  Complaint procedure. The complaint procedure is as follows: 
(1)  Management responsibility. Each member of management is responsible for creating an atmosphere free of discrimination, sexual or otherwise. Employees are responsible for respecting the rights of their coworkers. 
(2)  Reporting. If an employee experiences any job-related discrimination based on sex, race or another factor or believes he/she has been treated in an unlawful, discriminatory manner, the employee shall promptly report the incident to his/her supervisor, who will investigate the matter and take appropriate action, including reporting it to the director of administrative services. If the employee believes it would be inappropriate to discuss the matter with his/her supervisor, the employee should report it directly to the director of administrative services or the mayor, who will undertake an investigation. The employee's complaint will be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible. 
(3)  Determination. If the city determines that an employee is guilty of harassing another employee, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against the offending employee, up to and including discharge. 
(4)  Retaliation prohibited. The city prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for filing a bona fide complaint under this policy or for assisting in a complaint investigation. However, if, after investigating any complaint of harassment or unlawful discrimination, the city determines that the complaint is not bona fide or that an employee has provided false information regarding the complaint, disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, may be taken against the individual who filed the complaint or who gave the false information. 
(Code 1999, § 2-5-14) 
Sec. 2-745. - Sexual harassment policy. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this section is as follows: 
(1)  Sexual harassment prohibited. The common council feels it is imperative to maintain a workplace environment that encourages optimum human growth and development for its employees. Therefore, it is the policy of the city to maintain and ensure a learning and working environment free of any form of sexual harassment or intimidation towards personnel. The city does not tolerate sexual harassment in any form and will take all necessary and appropriate action to eliminate it, up to and including discipline of offenders. 
(2)  Sensitivity to be maintained. The city recognizes the private and sensitive nature of sexual harassment incidents and the emotional and social complexities surrounding such issues. Every effort will be made to consider the sensitivities of the parties involved and protect the victim from repercussions. Any employee who feels that he/she has been subjected to sexual harassment is encouraged to contact his/her immediate supervisor or the gender equity coordinator. The director of administrative services is appointed the gender equity coordinator. 
(3)  Supervisor training. Supervisors shall be in-serviced in the meaning, legal source and ramifications of this policy. 
(b)  Definition. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Sexual harassment also includes but is not limited to unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances or propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; subtle pressure or requests for sexual activities; unnecessary touching of an individual; graphic verbal commentaries about an individual's body; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit or offensive jokes; or physical assault. Sexual harassment can take the form of any unwanted sexual attention, ranging from leering, pinching, patting, verbal comments and subtle or expressed pressure for sexual activity. Besides the anxiety caused by sexual demands on the recipient, there is the implicit message from the alleged offender that noncompliance will lead to reprisals. Such reprisals may include but are not limited to harassment escalation, poor work assignments, unsatisfactory job evaluations, sabotage of the victim's work, difference in treatment, sarcasm, threatened demotion or nonpromotion, denial of benefits or raises and, ultimately, loss of a job or passing grade. 
(c)  Employee harassment by private citizens. Any employee who feels he/she has been subjected to sexual harassment by a private citizen may contact his/her supervisor or the gender equity coordinator. Such allegations will be handled under the appropriate complaint procedures or reported to the appropriate authorities. 
(d)  Employee harassment complaints. Procedures for filing employee harassment complaints are as follows: 
(1)  Employees who wish to file a complaint regarding a violation of this policy should follow the city's complaint procedure outlined in this section. Employees who are accused of sexual harassment shall be informed that they have a right to representation if and when their supervisors believe that the nature and circumstances of the accusations could lead to disciplinary action. 
(2)  Complaints may also be made to:

The gender equity coordinator shall give a written answer to the complaint within 15 working days after receipt of the written complaint. 
(3)  If the complainant is not satisfied with the answer of the gender equity coordinator, he/she may submit a written appeal to the personnel committee of the council indicating with particularity the nature of disagreement with the answer and reason underlying such disagreement. Such appeal must be filed within ten working days after receipt of the gender equity coordinator's answer. The personnel committee shall arrange a meeting with the complainant and other affected parties, if requested by the complainant, at a mutually agreeable time, to discuss the appeal. The personnel committee shall give a written answer to the complainant's appeal within ten working days after receipt of the appeal. 
(4)  If the complainant is not satisfied with the answer, a complaint may be filed with the common council within ten working days after receipt of the answer to subsection (e)(3) of this section. The common council shall, within 30 working days, conduct a meeting at which the complainant shall be given an opportunity to present the complaint.

Upon receipt of copy of such preliminary resolution, the director of public works shall prepare the report thereon. 
(b)  The report required by subsection (a) of this section shall consist of the following: 
(1)  Preliminary or final plans and specifications. 
(2)  An estimate of the entire cost of the proposed work or improvement. 
(3)  An estimate, as to each parcel of property affected, of:

(b)  A parcel of land against which has been levied a special assessment for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in one of the streets upon which it abuts shall be entitled to such deduction or exemption as the common council determines to be reasonable and just under the circumstances of each case when a special assessment is levied for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in the other street upon which such corner lot abuts. Under any circumstances the assessment will not be less than the long way of such lot. The common council may allow a similar deduction or exemption from special assessments levied for any other public improvement. 
(c)  Where sewer and/or water mains are installed on both sides of a corner lot, only the address side will be assessed. When a new parcel of land is created on the second or third side, in conformance to regulations in chapter 14, article II, containing the zoning code, the new parcel shall also pay a special assessment on the address side at the current rate for such improvements. Where an existing sewer and/or water main extension has been installed only as far as needed to serve a certain parcel and future extension is requested, all parcels involved will be assessed at the current rate. All future extensions will be installed across the full length of the parcel requesting such improvements. Deviations or modifications to proposed sewer and/or water main extensions must have council committee and/or common council approval.

(b)  Assessment a lien. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.60(13), any special assessment levied under this article shall be a lien on the property against which it is levied on behalf of the city. The common council shall provide for the collection of such assessments and may establish penalties for payment after the due date. The common council shall provide that all assessments not paid by the date specified shall be extended upon the tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, and all proceedings in relation to the collection of such delinquent taxes shall apply to such assessment, except as otherwise provided by statute. 
(Code 1999, § 3-2-11) 
Sec. 2-847. - Special charges permissible. 
(a)  In addition to all other methods provided by law, special charges for current services may be imposed by resolution by the common council by allocating all or part of the cost of the property served; such resolution setting forth the property location, the current service rendered by the city and the special charge therefor or cost thereof.

Such notice shall specify that on a certain date a hearing will be held by the common council as to whether the service in question shall be performed. 
(b)  Special charges for current services shall not be payable in installments. If not paid within the period fixed by the common council in the resolution, such delinquent special charges, pursuant to section 2-846, shall become a lien on the property as of the date of such delinquency and shall automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, as provided by Wis. Stats. § 66.0627, and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charge. Notice of special charges for current services need not be given except as required by Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(c)  Section 2-837(a) shall not be applicable to proceedings under this section. 
(Code 1999, § 3-2-12)

(Code 1999, § 3-2-13) 
Sec. 2-849. - Special assessment B bonds. 
    As an alternative to any other financing method, the common council may provide for the payment of the initial cost of any public improvement from the proceeds of special assessment B bonds issued under Wis. Stats. § 66.0713(4), (5). Special assessments to retire such bonds and pay the interest thereon shall be levied under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627, payable in such installments at a rate to be determined by the council based upon borrowed money rates at the time of the special assessment. 
(Code 1999, § 3-2-14) 
Sec. 2-850. - Deferral. 
(a)  Background. The intent of this section is as follows: 
(1)  Major infrastructure expansion projects assessed at the time of the project could force adjoining land (real property) owners, specifically land used for agricultural purposes, to sell the undeveloped land to pay required assessments. Adjoining land is considered to be private real estate contiguous on any side to the right-of-way or easement where the public project is implemented. 
(2)  Since major public improvement projects are undertaken to resolve a community need and facilitate orderly development, requiring adjoining landowners to pay an assessment at the time of a project may create an unnecessary financial hardship. Deferred assessments will promote orderly development and encourage landowners to develop land according to market conditions. 
(b)  Definition. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Deferred assessments are assessments waived until the time of land development or the transfer or sale of property or waived in their entirety, if development design requires alternate service lines to serve the platted area. Time of development is established by actual service hookups. 
(c)  Application. This section is applicable as follows: 
(1)  Assessments shall be deferred only on major public improvement projects to be determined by the common council, i.e., water transmission mains or sanitary sewer trunk/interceptor lines, that are implemented to satisfy an identified community need. 
(2)  Reserved. 
(3)  Deferred assessments do not apply to city residents in conjunction with curb/gutter, sidewalk, and driveway approaches. For township residents adjacent to these public improvements and who benefit from these improvements but are not assessed by township resolution, the property will be deferred assessed upon future annexation. The public works director will determine costs at the time of annexation, which shall be payable in five annual installments. 
(4)  Assessments charged for eight-inch water transmission lines and/or eight-inch sanitary sewer collectors shall be based on the final costs of the most recent bid or average of bids accepted by the council for this type of public improvements plus 15 percent for engineering. If no competitive bidding has taken place within 24 months, the public works director shall provide a cost based on other regional accepted bids. 
(d)  Exceptions. Adjoining property owners are responsible for payment of all laterals, service extensions, taps and similar components at the time of installation, except when this is part of a negotiated agreement for the exchange of land, land rights or other benefits for public purpose. 
(e)  Delinquent assessments. All deferred assessments, once they have been billed and become delinquent, shall bear interest from the date of the delinquency until paid at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(f)  Tracking/implementation. Procedures for tracking payments, records and providing a map of special assessments are as follows: 
(1)  A check system will be utilized to ensure assessments due the city are paid as future development occurs in areas under a deferred assessment. 
(2)  The water and sewer utility shall record an assessment amount due in department records. Upon request for a hookup or service connection, the utilities shall verify that all fees have been paid. 
(3)  The public works director shall develop and provide the city inspector with a map detailing land or parcels under a deferred assessment. The inspector shall reference this map prior to issuing permits for construction.

Sec. 2-883. - Levy. 
(a)  Imposition of tax. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.75, a tax is imposed on the privilege and services of furnishing rooms or lodging to transients by hotelkeepers, motel operators and other persons furnishing accommodations that are available to the public, irrespective of whether membership is required for the use of the accommodations. Such tax shall be at the rate of six percent of the gross receipts from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodgings. Such tax shall not be subject to the selective sales tax imposed by Wis. Stats. § 77.51(2)(a)1. 
(b)  Monthly payment. Such tax may be payable monthly. 
(c)  Exemptions. The following room sales are exempt from this tax: 
(1)  Sales to the federal government. 
(2)  Sales to persons listed under Wis. Stats. § 77.54(9a). 
(d)  Exemption conditions. The following conditions must occur for a sale to be exempt from the room tax: 
(1)  The lodging establishment must issue the billing or invoice for the lodging in the name of the exempt entity; and 
(2)  The lodging establishment must receive from the exempt entity: 
a.  For federal and state or local governmental units, a purchase order or similar written document, such as a letter of authorization; or 
b.  For nonprofit religious, charitable, scientific or educational organizations, the organization's certificate of exempt status number. 
(3)  The exemption still applies if the employee pays with his/her own funds, as long as the conditions of this subsection are met. 
(e)  Collection of tax. Procedures for collection of the tax are as follows: 
(1)  Administration by clerk-treasurer. This tax shall be administered by the clerk-treasurer who shall, at city expense, provide the necessary application and reporting forms at no cost to the taxpayer. 
(2)  Reporting periods. The tax imposed for the months of January, February and March and for each calendar quarter thereafter is due and payable on the last day of the month next succeeding the calendar quarter for which imposed. A return shall be filed with the clerk-treasurer, by those furnishing at retail such rooms and lodging, on or before the same date on which such tax is due and payable. Such returns shall show the gross receipts of the preceding calendar quarter from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodging, the amount of taxes imposed for such period, and such other information as the clerk-treasurer deems necessary. Every person required to file such quarterly return shall, with his/her first return, elect to file an annual calendar-year or fiscal-year return. Such annual return shall be filed within 90 days of the close of each such calendar or fiscal year. The annual return shall summarize the quarterly returns, shall reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly returns, and shall contain certain additional information as the clerk-treasurer requires. Such annual returns shall be made on forms as prescribed by the clerk-treasurer. All such returns shall be signed by the person required to file a return or duly authorized agent, but need not be verified by oath. The clerk-treasurer may, for good cause, extend the time for filing any return, but in no event longer than one month from the filing date. 
(3)  Sale or conveyance of business. If any person liable for any amount of tax under this section sells out his/her business or stock of goods or quits the business, his/her successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the clerk-treasurer that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If a person subject to the tax imposed by this section fails to withhold such amount of tax from the purchase price as required, he/she shall become personally liable for payment of the amount required to be withheld by him/her to the extent of the price of the accommodations valued in money. 
(4)  Determination of tax by audit. An audit may be made to determine the tax as follows: 
a.  The clerk-treasurer may, by office audit, determine the tax required to be paid to the city or the refund due to any person under this article. This determination may be made upon the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or on the basis of any other information within the clerk-treasurer's possession that meets the criteria set forth in Wis. Stats. § 66.0615. One or more such office audit determinations may be made of the amount due for any one or for more than one period. 
b.  The clerk-treasurer may, by field audit, determine the tax required to be paid to the city or the refund due to any person under this article. The determination may be made upon the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or upon any other information within the clerk-treasurer's possession. The clerk-treasurer is authorized to examine and inspect the books, records, memoranda and property of any person in order to verify the tax liability of that person or of another person. Nothing in subsection (4) of this section shall prevent the clerk-treasurer from making a determination of the tax at any time. 
(5)  Failure to file return. If any person fails to file a return as required by this article, the clerk-treasurer shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts under subsection (a) of this section. Such estimate shall be made for the period for which such person failed to make a return and shall be based upon any information which is in the clerk-treasurer's possession or may come into the clerk-treasurer's possession. On the basis of this estimate, the clerk-treasurer shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city, adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty equal to ten percent thereof. One or more such determinations may be made for one or more than one period. 
(6)  Interest on unpaid taxes. All unpaid taxes under this article shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per year from the due date of the return until the first day of the month following the month in which the tax is paid or deposited with the clerk-treasurer. An extension of time within which to file a return shall operate to extend the due date of the return for purposes of interest computations. If the clerk-treasurer determines that any overpayment of the tax has been made intentionally or by reason of carelessness or neglect or if the tax which was overpaid was not accompanied by a complete return, he/she shall not allow any interest thereon. 
(7)  Delinquent returns. Late fees and penalties for delinquent returns shall be as follows: 
a.  Delinquent tax returns shall be subject to a late filing fee of $100.00. The tax imposed by this section shall become delinquent if not paid as follows: 
1.  For a timely filed return, within 30 days after the due date of the return or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension period, if one is granted. 
2.  If no return is filed or a return is filed late, by the due date of the return. 
b.  If due to negligence no return is filed or a return is filed late or an incorrect return is filed, the entire tax finally determined shall be subject to a forfeiture established as follows: 
1.  A forfeiture of 25 percent or $5,000.00, whichever is less, of the tax imposed and is due and owing within 30 days after the due date of the return. 
2.  If a person fails to file a return when due or files a false or fraudulent return with the intent in either case to defeat or evade a tax imposed by this article, a forfeiture of 50 percent of the entire tax finally determined shall be added to the tax required to be paid exclusive of interest and other penalties.

    In order to protect the revenue of the city, the clerk-treasurer may require any person liable for the tax imposed by this article to place with him/her, before or after a permit is issued, such security not in excess of $100.00 as the clerk-treasurer shall determine. If any taxpayer fails or refuses to place security, the clerk-treasurer may revoke or refuse to issue such permit. If any taxpayer is delinquent in the payment of the taxes imposed by this article, the clerk-treasurer may, upon ten days' notice, recover the taxes, interest and penalties from the security placed with the clerk-treasurer by such taxpayer. No interest shall be paid or allowed by the city to any person for the deposit of such security.

In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he/she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record.

Sec. 2-933. - Preservation through microfilm. 
    Any city officer or the director of any department or division of city government may, subject to the approval of the director of administrative services, keep and preserve public records in his/her possession by means of microfilm or other photographic reproduction method. Such records shall meet the standards for photographic reproduction set forth in Wis. Stats. §§ 16.61(7)(a) and (b) and shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of law and of sections 2-929 through 2-931. 
(Code 1999, § 3-3-9) 
Sec. 2-934. - E-mail record retention policy. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to emphasize that certain types of mail as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.32(2) are public records. The same rules that apply to record retention and disclosure for other governing unit documents apply to such records. 
(b)  Organizations affected. This policy applies to all of the governing units of the city including its departments, divisions, offices, boards, commissions, committees, governing unit employees and contracted and consulting resources. 
(c)  Policy. It is the policy of the governing unit to follow this set of procedures for e-mail record retention. 
(d)  References. Wis. Stats. §§ 16.612, 19.21 et seq., 19.32 and 19.33. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Nature of e-mail records. As a general rule, e-mail is a public record whenever a paper message with the same content would be a public record. See Wis. Stats. § 19.32(2) for definition of a record. 
(2)  Components of an e-mail record. The e-mail record is defined to include the message, the identities of the sender and all recipients, the date, and any non-archived attachments to the e-mail message. Any return receipt indicating the sender received the message is also considered to be part of the record. 
(3)  Saving and indexing e-mail records. Initially the custodian (that officer, department head, or employee of the governing unit who keeps or is in possession of an e-mail) bears the responsibility for determining whether or not a particular e-mail record is a public record that should be saved and ensuring the record is properly indexed and forwarded for retention as a public record. E-mail that is subject to records retention must be saved and should be indexed with all related files and documents so that a complete record can be accessed when needed. E-mail records to be retained shall be printed out or saved electronically in the appropriate file. Any officer, department head, or employee of the governing unit may request assistance from the legal custodian of records (the governing unit clerk or the clerk's designee, except that the chief of police is legal custodian of police department records) in determining whether e-mail is a public record. 
(4)  E-mail open record guidelines. 
a.  The general rule is that e-mail is a public record whenever a paper message with the same content would be a public record. It is the message and not the medium that determines whether an item is a public record. 
b.  Each employee must decide whether or not an e-mail that is either sent or received constitutes a public record. If an e-mail is determined to be a public record, then it must be saved. E-mail may be saved electronically or in hard copy, (printed), or both. 
c.  Public records do not include non-final drafts of documents, personal notes on business matters, preliminary computations, or like materials. 
d.  Public records do not include personal messages, invitations to meetings, or confirmations of meetings. 
e.  Public records do not include generic requests for information or replies to requests for information. 
(5)  Responsibilities for e-mail records management. 
a.  Each elected official is the legal custodian of his/her records and the records of his/her office, but the official may designate the clerk-treasurer to act as the legal custodian. 
b.  Unless provided in subsection (3) of this section, the clerk-treasurer or the clerk-treasurer's designee shall act as legal custodian for the common council and for any committees, commissions, boards, or other authorities created by ordinance or resolution of the common council. The following offices or authorities shall have as a legal custodian of records the individual so named: 
Authority Designated legal custodian City assessor's office City assessor General city records, including council records Clerk-treasurer Fire department Fire chief Police department Chief of police Financial records Clerk-treasurer City attorney's office City attorney Administrative office Director of administrative services Park, recreation and cemetery Park, recreation and cemetery supervisor Communications and technology Communications and technology supervisor Street department Street commissioner  
c.  For every authority not specified in subsections (e)(5)a. and b. of this section, the authority's chief administrative officer is the legal custodian for the authority, but the officer may designate an employee of his/her staff to act as the legal custodian. 
d.  Each legal custodian shall name a person to act as legal custodian in his/her absence or in the absence of his/her designee, and each legal custodian shall send notice of the designated deputy to the clerk-treasurer. 
e.  The clerk-treasurer shall establish criteria for establishing the records system and shall cause the department/office records system to be reviewed on an annual basis. 
(6)  Public access to e-mail records. If a department receives a request for release of an e-mail public record, the legal custodian of the record shall determine if it is appropriate for public release, in whole or in part, pursuant to law, consulting the governing unit attorney, if necessary. As with other records, access to or electronic copies of disclosable records shall be provided within a reasonable time. 
(7)  Violation. Employees violating this policy are subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. In addition, violations of this policy may be referred for civil and/or criminal prosecution, where appropriate.

    Surplus city property means that property which is owned by the city and which has no further usefulness to the city. An item of property shall be considered to have no further usefulness when: 
(1)  The item or its function has been totally replaced by other city property and no probable future function exists for it; 
(2)  The city no longer performs the service for which the item was purchased and no other service can reasonably be provided by the item; or 
(3)  The item is no longer able to reliably or economically perform the work required of it. 
Surplus city property shall not include land or buildings, but shall include fixtures and such salvage as may be taken from a building without structural damage when such fixtures and salvage are not part of a demolition contract. Surplus city property shall not include property which is obtained by the city as a result of abandonment or loss by the property's original owner. Surplus city property shall not include items of property which are traded in for newer items.

Sec. 2-998. - Disposition. 
(a)  All property owned by the city, which is no longer used or is unclaimed property which has been surrendered to various city departments, as well as other property which has been confiscated by the police department, shall only be disposed of on a quarterly basis as follows: 
(1)  Donation to a nonprofit organization within the city or to a governmental agency; 
(2)  Public auction or sale; 
(3)  Sale by sealed bid; 
(4)  Negotiated sale; or 
(5)  Traded in. 
(b)  If a public auction or sale is conducted by sealed bid, the item will be sold in "as-is" condition to the person submitting the highest bid; provided, however, that a lower bid submitted by a nonprofit organization or governmental agency may be accepted by the director of administrative services. The department head responsible for the item shall determine the time in which the successful bidder must remove the item. If the item is not removed within that time, the item shall revert to the city and the amount of the bid shall be forfeited to the city. If no bids are received, the item shall be disposed of as directed by the director of administrative services. 
(c)  The director of administrative services shall, within ten days of sale, auction or accepting bids, advertise such sale, auction, or bids in the official newspaper of the city. 
(d)  Whenever the fair market value of an item is $500.00 or less and has been determined, pursuant to this division, that it is surplus city property, the item shall be either disposed of as set forth in this section or destroyed. 
(Code 1999, § 3-4-1(c)) 
Sec. 2-999. - Determination of fair market values. 
    Whenever this division requires a determination of the fair market value of an item of property, that determination shall be made by the department head responsible for the property, whose decision shall be final.

Sec. 6-5. - Natural lawns. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Natural lawn includes common species of grass and wildflowers native to North America which are designed and purposely cultivated to exceed eight inches in height from the ground. Specifically excluded in natural lawns are the noxious grasses and weeds identified in section 6-4. The growth of a natural lawn in excess of eight inches in height from the ground surface shall be prohibited within the city corporate limits unless a natural lawn management plan is approved and a permit is issued by the city as set forth in this section. Natural lawns shall not contain litter or debris and shall not harbor undesirable wildlife. 
    Natural lawn management plan means a written plan relating to the management and maintenance of a lawn which contains a legal description of lawn upon which the planted grass will exceed eight inches in length; a statement of intent and purpose for the lawn; a detailed description of the vegetational types, plants and plant succession involved; and the specific management and maintenance techniques to be employed. 
    Property owner includes the legal title holder and/or the beneficial owner of any such lot according to most current city records. 
(b)  Procedures. General procedures for planting a natural lawn are as follows: 
(1)  Property owners who wish to plant and cultivate a natural lawn must submit their written plan and related information on the form provided by the city. Natural lawn management plans shall only indicate the planting and cultivating of natural lawns on property legally owned by the property owner. Applicants are strictly prohibited from developing a natural lawn on any city-owned property including street rights-of-way. This shall include at a minimum property located between the sidewalk and the street or a strip not less than ten feet adjacent to the street where there is no sidewalk, whether the area is under public or private ownership. In addition, natural lawns shall not be permitted within ten feet of the abutting property owner's property unless waived in writing by the abutting property owner on the side so affected. Such waiver is to be affixed to the lawn management plan. 
(2)  Any subsequent property owner who abuts an approved natural lawn may revoke the waiver, thereby requiring the owner of the natural lawn to remove the natural lawn that is located in the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property owner. Such revocation shall be put in writing and presented to the clerk-treasurer by the subsequent abutting property owner. Upon receiving the written request to revoke the original waiver, the common council shall contact the owner of the approved natural lawn and direct the owner to remove the natural lawn located in the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property owner. The common council shall revise the approved natural lawn management permit accordingly. The owner of the approved natural lawn shall be required to remove the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property owner within 20 days of receipt of the written notification from the city, provided the notification is received sometime between May 1 and November 1. Property owners who receive notification from the city between November 1 and April 30 shall be required to remove the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property owner no later than May 20 following receipt of the notification. 
(c)  Application process. The process for filing an application for a natural lawn management permit is as follows: 
(1)  Property owners interested in applying for permission to establish a natural lawn shall obtain and complete an application form available from the clerk-treasurer. The completed application shall include a natural lawn management plan. Upon submitting a completed application, a nonrefundable filing fee as prescribed by section 1-22 will be assessed by the city. Upon receiving payment, copies of the completed application shall be mailed by the city to each of the owners of record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of the property situated wholly or in part within 300 feet of the boundaries of the property for which the application is made. If, within 15 calendar days of mailing the copies of the complete application to the neighboring property owners, the city receives written objections from 51 percent or more of the neighboring property owners, the clerk-treasurer shall immediately deny the application. Neighboring property owners shall be defined as all those property owners who are located within 300 feet of the proposed natural lawn site. 
(2)  If the property owner's application is in full compliance with the natural lawn management plan requirements and less than 51 percent of the neighboring property owners provide written objections, the clerk-treasurer shall issue permission to install a natural lawn. Such permit shall be valid for two years. Permit renewals shall follow the procedures in this section. 
(d)  Appeal of permit denial. The property owner may appeal the clerk-treasurer's decision to deny the natural lawn permit request to the common council at an open meeting. All applications for appeal shall be submitted within 15 calendar days of the notice of denial of the natural lawn management plan. The decision rendered by the common council shall be final and binding. 
(e)  Safety precautions for natural grass areas. Safety precautions for natural grass areas are as follows: 
(1)  When, in the opinion of the fire chief of the department serving the city, the presence of a natural lawn may constitute a fire or safety hazard due to weather and/or other conditions, the fire chief may order the cutting of natural lawns to a safe condition. As a condition of receiving approval of the natural lawn permit, the property owner shall be required to cut the natural lawn within the three days upon receiving written direction from the fire chief.

The decision rendered by the common council shall be final and binding. 
(g)  Public nuisance; abatement after notice. Determination of a public nuisance and procedures for abatement of the nuisance after notice are as follows: 
(1)  The growth of a natural lawn as defined in this section shall be considered a public nuisance unless a natural lawn management plan has been filed and approved and a permit is issued by the city as set forth in this section. Violators shall be served with a notice of public nuisance by certified mail to the last known mailing address of the property owner. 
(2)  If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation does not abate the nuisance within ten days, the enforcement officer may proceed to abate such nuisance, keeping an account of the expense of the abatement, and such expense shall be charged to and paid by such property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the public nuisance shall be mailed to the owner of the premises and shall be payable within ten calendar days from receipt thereof. Within 60 days after such costs and expenses are incurred and remain unpaid, the clerk-treasurer shall enter those charges onto the tax roll as a special tax as provided by statute. 
(3)  The failure of the clerk-treasurer to record such claim or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to place the city expense on the tax rolls for unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance as provided for in this section. 
(h)  Penalty. Penalties for violation of this section are as follows: 
(1)  Any person who does not abate the nuisance within the required time period or who otherwise violates this section shall be subject to section 1-14.

(Code 1999, § 8-1-5) 
Sec. 6-6. - Length of lawn and grasses. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the city. 
(b)  Public nuisance declared. The common council finds that lawns, grasses, and noxious weeds on nonagricultural lots or parcels of land, as classified under the zoning code in chapter 14, article II, within the city which exceed six inches in length adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interfere with public convenience and adversely affect property values of other land within the city. For that reason, any nonagricultural lawn, grass or weeds on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds six inches in length is declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designated floodplain area and/or wetland area and where the lawn, grass or weeds is part of natural lawn approved pursuant to section 6-5. 
(c)  Nuisances prohibited. No person shall permit any public nuisance as defined in subsection (b) of this section to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him/her within the city. 
(d)  Inspection. The weed commissioner or his/her designee shall inspect or cause to be inspected all premises and places within the city to determine whether any public nuisance as defined in subsection (b) of this section exists. 
(e)  Abatement of nuisance. If the weed commissioner shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance as defined subsection (b) of this section exists, he/she shall immediately cause written notice to be served that the city proposes to have the lot, grass or lawn cut to conform with this section and section 6-5. If further occurrences within one calendar year arise, the property will be turned over to a contractor supplied by the city without further notification, and the owner will be billed accordingly. 
(f)  Due process hearing. If the owner believes that his/her grasses or weeds are not a nuisance, he/she may request a hearing before a committee of the common council designated by the mayor. The request for the hearing must be made in writing to the clerk-treasurer's office within the five days set forth in the weed commissioner's notice. Upon application for the hearing, the property owner must deposit a bond as prescribed by section 1-22. If a decision is rendered in the property owner's favor, the bond will be returned to the property owner. If the property owner fails to appear for the hearing or if the decision is rendered against the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to the cost of city personnel abating the nuisance, if necessary. When a hearing is requested by the owner of the property, a hearing by the committee shall be held within seven days from the date of the owner's request. The property in question will not be mowed by the city until such time as the hearing is held by the committee. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his/her attorney, may present witnesses in his/her own behalf and may cross examine witnesses presented by the city as well as subpoena witnesses for his/her own case. At the close of the hearing, the committee shall make its determination in writing specifying its findings, facts and conclusions. If the committee determines that a public nuisance did exist, the committee shall order the weed commissioner to mow the property in question unless the property has been mowed by the owner within 48 hours of the committee's decision. If the owner does not abate the nuisance within the described 48 hours, the weed commissioner shall cause the nuisance to be abated and costs in excess of the forfeited fee assessed accordingly. 
(g)  City's option to abate nuisance. When the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his/her lawn, grass or weeds as set forth in this section, the city may elect to cut the lawn, grass or weeds as follows: 
(1)  The written notice required in subsection (e) of this section shall inform the person that, for his/her failure to abate the nuisance within the prescribed time, the city shall abate the nuisance, and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as a special charge. 
(2)  The city shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject's property and shall charge the expenses of so doing at a rate as established in section 1-22. The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the clerk-treasurer who, in turn, shall mail the statement to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the subject premises. If the statement is not paid in full within 30 days thereafter, the clerk-treasurer shall enter the charges in the tax roll as a special tax against the lot or parcel of land, and the charges shall be collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate or as provided under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(h)  Other enforcement options. In addition to or as an alternative to the abatement procedures in subsection (g) of this section, any person in violation of the requirements of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture as provided in section 1-14. 
(i)  An owner of a parcel of more than three acres may apply to the city for a variance from this section to allow for agricultural use. All adjoining property owners must be given prior written notice of the variance hearing at least 14 days in advance of the hearing. A committee of the common council appointed by the mayor, which shall be the same committee referred to in subsection (f), shall review and decide upon such variance requests. Any variances granted under this subsection shall be valid for a three-year term only.

Any person who feels aggrieved by the decision of the zoning administrator may appeal to the zoning board of appeals, which has power in a specific case, by the vote of a majority of its members, to grant a permit for a building or such street, highway, parkway, park or playground, which will as little as practicable increase the cost of opening such street, highway, parkway, park or playground. Such board may impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting such permit, which requirements shall be designed to promote the health, convenience, safety or general welfare of the city. Such board shall refuse a permit where the applicant will not be substantially damaged by placing his/her building outside the planned street, highway, parkway, park or playground. 
(i)  Fees. Prior to issuing a zoning permit, the zoning administrator shall collect from the applicant, to defray the costs to the city of processing the application, a permit fee as provided in section 1-22.

(e)  Effect on municipal services. Before granting any site approval, the plan commission may, besides obtaining advice from consultants, secure such advice as may be deemed necessary from the city engineer or other municipal officials, with special attention to the effect of such approval upon existing municipal services and utilities.

(b)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certified to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
(c)  Powers of zoning board of appeals. In addition to the powers enumerated elsewhere in this Code, the board of appeals shall have the following powers: 
(1)  Errors. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the zoning administrator or building inspector. 
(2)  Variances. To hear and grant appeals for variances as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, the spirit and purposes of this article shall be observed and the public safety, welfare and justice secured. 
(3)  Interpretations. To hear and decide applications for interpretations of the zoning regulations and the boundaries of the zoning districts after the plan commission has made a review and recommendation. 
(4)  Substitutions. To hear and grant applications for substitution of more restrictive nonconforming uses for existing nonconforming uses, provided no structural alterations are to be made and the plan commission has made a review and recommendation. Whenever the board permits such a substitution, the use may not thereafter be changed without application.

    The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing as provided in this subdivision, cause notice thereof to be published in the official newspaper not less than seven days prior thereto, and cause notice to be given to the appellant or applicant and the administrative officer appealed from by regular mail or by personal service not less than five days prior to the date of hearing.

Sec. 14-139. - Variances. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is as follows: 
(1)  A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict adherence to this article would cause him/her undue hardship or create conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to a nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning requirements. 
(2)  The board of appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of this article will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this article shall be observed and substantial justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by law. 
(3)  For the purposes of this section, the term "unnecessary hardship" shall be defined as an unusual or extreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoning district which is caused by facts, such as rough terrain or poor soil conditions, uniquely applicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most or all property in the same zoning district. 
(b)  Application. The application for variance shall be filed with the clerk-treasurer. Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected. The application shall contain the following information: 
(1)  The names and addresses of the applicant and all abutting and opposite property owners of record. 
(2)  A statement that the applicant is the owner or the authorized agent of the owner of the property. 
(3)  The address and description of the property. 
(4)  A site plan showing an accurate depiction of the property. 
(5)  Additional information required by the plan commission, city engineer, board of zoning appeals or zoning administrator. 
(c)  Public hearing on application. A public hearing on the application shall be held in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Reserved. 
(2)  The board of appeals shall conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed variation. Notice of such hearing shall be given not more than 30 days and not less than seven days before the hearing in one or more of the newspapers in general circulation in the city and shall give due notice to the parties in interest, the zoning administrator and the plan commission. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. The board shall thereafter reach its decision within 30 days after the final hearing and shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant, zoning administrator and plan commission. 
(d)  Action of board of appeals. For the board of appeals to grant a variance, it must find that: 
(1)  Denial of the variation may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographical consideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this article should be changed. 
(2)  The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is being sought and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity. 
(3)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the property. 
(4)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(5)  The proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of this article. 
(6)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this article and has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property. 
(7)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(e)  Conditions. The board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section.

    Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board of appeals may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the offices of the board of appeals.

Sec. 14-653. - Bulk regulations. 
    For any planned development, the plan commission may recommend and the common council may authorize exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this article within the boundaries of such development, provided that the plan commission shall find: 
(1)  Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development as well as the neighboring property than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of this article for buildings developed on separate zoning lots. 
(2)  The overall floor area ratio for the planned development would not exceed, by more than 20 percent, the maximum floor area ratio which would be determined on the basis of the floor area ratio required for the individual uses in such planned developments, as stipulated in each district. 
(3)  The minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements of this article shall not be decreased by more than 20 percent in any such development containing residential uses, and permanent open space or land, to an amount equivalent to that by which each residential lot or building site has been diminished under this division, shall be provided in common recreation area within the development. 
(4)  Spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly developed under the terms of this article on separate zoning lots, due consideration being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening streets and alleys. 
(5)  Along the periphery of such planned developments, yards shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which the development is located. 
(Code 1999, § 13-1-60(c)) 
Sec. 14-654. - Procedures. 
    Procedures for approval of planned unit developments are as follows: 
(1)  Step 1, procedure for reviewing a planned unit development. The procedure for reviewing a planned unit development is as follows: 
a.  The procedure for reviewing a planned unit development shall be the same as for any other conditional use prescribed in subdivision II of division 5 of this article, except that in addition a general development plan shall be submitted to the plan commission. The general development plan of the proposed project shall be presented at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet and shall show at least the following information: 
1.  The pattern of public and private roads, driveways and parking facilities. 
2.  A description of land uses and building types, sizes and arrangements. 
3.  A utility feasibility analysis. 
4.  The location of recreational and open space areas reserved or dedicated to the public.

(2)  Step 2, specific implementation plan approval. Procedures for specific implementation plan approval are as follows: 
a.  Detailed plans are not required to be contemplated at the time the conditional use is approved; however, the review process may be made faster by doing so. Before any building permit is issued, the plan commission shall review and approve a specific implementation plan. The applicant shall file the following with the plan commission: 
1.  A final plat of the entire development area, showing detailed lot layout, intended uses of each parcel, public dedication, public and private streets, driveways, walkways and parking facilities. 
2.  The location and treatment of open space areas.

5.  A utility plan locating all utility installations. 
6.  A stormwater drainage and erosion control plan. 
7.  Agreements, bylaws, provisions or covenants which govern the organizational structure, use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned unit development. 
b.  At a regular meeting, the plan commission shall approve or require changes consistent with the approved general development plan. Upon final approval of the specific implementation plans, they shall be filed with the zoning administrator and shall be referred to in regard to enforcement or modification of the development plans. All covenants, restrictions or contractual agreements with the city shall be recorded with the register of deeds before final issuance of building permits. 
(Code 1999, § 13-1-60(d)) 
Sec. 14-655. - Modifications.

Subdivision II. - Conditional Uses 

Sec. 14-706. - Statement of purpose. 
    The development and execution of this subdivision is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities and of the public need for the particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district, provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses. 
(Code 1999, § 13-1-80) 
Sec. 14-707. - Authority of the plan commission and common council; permit requirements. 
(a)  The common council authorizes the zoning administrator to issue a conditional use permit after review, public hearing and approval from the plan commission and common council, provided that such conditional use and involved structures are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this article and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. Such commission or common council action and the resulting conditional use permit shall specify the period of time for which effective if specified, the name of the permittee, the location and legal description of the affected premises. Prior to the granting of a conditional use, the common council shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards prescribed in this subdivision are being complied with. 
(b)  Any development within 500 feet of the existing or proposed rights-of-way of freeways, expressways and within one-half mile of their existing or proposed interchange or turning lane rights-of-way shall be specifically reviewed by the highway agency that has jurisdiction over the trafficway. The plan commission and common council shall request such review and await the highway agency's recommendation for a period not to exceed 20 days before taking final action. 
(c)  Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements may be required by the plan commission and common council upon their finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this article.

Sec. 14-710. - Hearing on application. 
    Nothing in this article shall prohibit the common council on its own motion from referring the request for conditional use to the plan commission. Upon receipt of the application and statement referred to in section 14-709, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use at such time and place as shall be established by the commission. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the plan commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.

Such special construction might include, among other techniques, terracing, retaining walls, oversized foundations and footings, drain tile, etc. 
(Code 1999, § 13-1-88) 
Sec. 14-715. - Validity. 
    Where a conditional use application has been approved or conditionally approved, such approval shall become null and void within 24 months of the date of the approval unless the use is commenced, construction is underway or the current owner possesses a valid building permit under which construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance and which shall not be renewed unless construction has commenced and is being diligently prosecuted. Approximately 45 days prior to the automatic revocation of such permit, the zoning administrator shall notify the holder by certified mail of such revocation.

Sec. 14-716. - Complaints. 
(a)  The common council shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses.

(b)  Upon written complaint by any citizen or official, the common council shall initially determine whether such complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the subject conditional use is in violation of either one or more of the standards set forth in section 14-712, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed under this subdivision. Upon reaching a positive initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice as provided in section 14-711. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person or be represented by an agent or attorney. 
(c)  The common council may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth in section 14-712 or conditions previously imposed by the common council, modify existing conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use. If no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be made in order to ensure that the standards in section 14-712(a) and (b) will be met, the common council may revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the zoning administrator and the city attorney to seek elimination of the subject use. 
(d)  Following any such hearing, the decision of the common council shall be furnished to the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor.

Approval of an expansion of a limited family business or home occupation at a future time beyond the limitations of this section is not to be anticipated; relocation of the business to an area that is appropriately zoned may be necessary. 
(b)  Restrictions. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, home occupations are a conditional use in all residential districts and are subject to the requirements of the district in which the use is located, in addition to the following: 
(1)  The home occupation shall be conducted only within the enclosed area of the dwelling unit or an attached garage.

(9)  Under no circumstances shall a vehicle repair or body work business qualify as a home occupation. 
(10)  No more than one nonresident employee may work on the home occupation premises. 
(c)  Permitted use exception. A home occupation under this section may be maintained in any residential district as a permitted use, as opposed to a conditional use, if the standards of subsection (b) of this section are complied with and no sign is erected or maintained regarding the home occupation, no more than one person works on the premises, no customers regularly come to the house and the business is service oriented and not engaged in retail trade.

(1)  For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after December 1968, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the districts in which such buildings or uses are located. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified for required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. 
(3)  Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. 
(b)  Existing parking facilities. Accessory off-street parking facilities in existence in December 1968 and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not be reduced below or, if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under this subdivision. 
(c)  Permissible parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations governing the location, design and operation of such facilities are adhered to. 
(d)  Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in existence as of December 1968 which subsequently is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that such facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this subdivision for equivalent new uses or construction. 
(e)  Control of off-site parking facilities. When parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or longterm lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the board of appeals. The owner of the land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the office of the register of deeds of the county requiring such owner, his/her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of the lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 14-925. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the floodplain zoning article. 
(Ord. No. 1183B, § 1, 5-14-2008) 
Sec. 14-926. - General provisions. 
(a)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-zones on the flood insurance rate map. 
(b)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the city floodplain appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the flood insurance study (FIS) or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the city clerk. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(c)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
(1)  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
(2)  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
(3)  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
(d)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (1) or (2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to division 8. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 14-1018(3) and the criteria in (1) and (2) below. 
(1)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to section 14-1036(6). 
(e)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to division 8. 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC). 
(f)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the state department of transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 or 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this article, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(2)  This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this article, required by Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 116 is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance from which this article is derived or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
(j)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this article create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(k)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The county floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(m)  General development standards. The city shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this article.

(a)  Applicability. If these standards conform with Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(h), for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this article or any amendment thereto. 
(b)  The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may continue subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this article. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered an extension, modification or addition; these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure. 
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
(2)  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this article; 
(3)  The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent; 
(4)  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this article. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with subsection 14-973(1). The costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50 percent provisions of this paragraph; 
(5)  a.  Except as provided in subsection b., if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structure's present equalized assessed value. 
b.  For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA regulations (44 CFR Part 60), or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
(6)  A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure, the alteration will comply with subsection 14-958(a), flood resistant materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that comply with section 14-1020 are used.

(1)  Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river. 
(2)  Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching. 
(3)  Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use. 
The state supreme court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis. Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975). For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of this state though it may be dry during other seasons.

The director of public works' determinations and recommendations shall be forwarded to the plan commission. 
(4)  City attorney. The city attorney is vested with the duty and responsibility of reviewing all preliminary subdivision plats after they have been reviewed by the plan commission to make determinations in the areas of application and process completeness, special conditions, applicable fees, easements and land dedications and reservations. The attorney's determinations and recommendations shall be forwarded to the plan commission and the common council. 
(5)  Subdivision and site plan committee. The chairperson of the plan commission may appoint a subdivision and site plan committee once a formal application is submitted to the city by the subdivider. The subdivision and site plan committee shall consist of at least one committee member along with technical and other staff members, such as the director of administrative services, director of public works, park and recreation director and/or city inspector, as deemed appropriate. The purpose of the subdivision and site plan committee is to thoroughly review, comment, obtain necessary information and make recommendations with respect to subdivision and site plan applications and to perform other duties conferred on this committee by the plan commission through a motion duly adopted and recorded. 
(Code 1999, § 14-1-6(a)) 
Sec. 14-1206. - Variations and exceptions. 
(a)  Hardships. Where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with this article, it may recommend variations or exceptions to this article so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this article and, further provided the plan commission shall not recommend variations or exceptions to this article unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(1)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(2)  The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property. 
(3)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of this article were carried out. 
(4)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property. 
(b)  Large-scale developments. The standards and requirements of this article may be modified for large-scale developments when the plan commission finds that a plan and program for a new residential area unit provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and public utility service needs of the tract when fully developed and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity and achievement of the plan. 
(c)  Conditions. In recommending variations and exceptions, the plan commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this article. 
(d)  Waiver of certified survey map. The plan commission may waive the requirement for a certified survey map and its related processes, in lieu of an accurate metes and bounds description. The intent of this waiver is to provide a faster, less expensive method of land division for small land conveyances. An example of an appropriate waiver situation is when an owner wishes to convey half of his/her vacant residential lot to a neighbor. The following conditions must be met for the plan commission to have the authority to make the waiver: 
(1)  The land division does not involve publicly held lands; 
(2)  There is no possibility of the land division resulting in the creation of a buildable lot, per article II of this chapter pertaining to zoning; 
(3)  The division is occurring within a previously recorded certified survey; 
(4)  A site plan is presented to the city at a preapplication conference; 
(5)  The director of public works has approved the site plan; and 
(6)  The site plan will be duly recorded with the metes and bounds description. 
(e)  Waiver of site plan application. The plan commission may waive the requirement for site plan approval where there is a change in use or occupancy and no extensive construction or improvements or de minimis construction or improvements are sought. The waiver may be granted only upon a resolution by the plan commission finding that the use will not affect existing drainage, circulation, relationship of buildings to each other, landscaping, recreation, buffering, lighting and other considerations of site plan approval and that the existing facilities do not require upgraded or additional site improvements. The application for a waiver of a site plan shall include a discussion of the prior use of the site, the proposed use and its impact. 
(f)  Recommendations. Such variations, conditions, waivers and exceptions as may be recommended by the plan commission shall be forwarded to the common council in writing, substantiating the recommended variations, conditions, waivers and/or exceptions. The common council may approve such variations, conditions, waivers or exceptions from the requirements of this article in specific cases, as listed on the final plat, which in its opinion do not adversely affect the intent and purposes of the city's master plan, zoning ordinances, building codes, official map ordinance, architectural review board determinations or capital improvement budget.

(b)  Requirements for adequate open spaces. Requirements for adequate open spaces are as follows: 
(1)  Floodplain areas. The common council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the population of the community and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from activities such as clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste material or stumps. 
(2)  School, park and playground sites. Unless appropriate provision for dedication or donation of school, park or playground sites has been made by the common council in a previous action, such as for a large-scale development involving multiple land uses, any required school sites, parks or playgrounds shall be acquired by the school district or the appropriate city, town or county agency. 
(c)  Acquisition of land for public use. Procedures for the acquisition of land for public use are as follows: 
(1)  Generally.

Land may be acquired for public school sites, parks, playgrounds or other public recreation areas or other public purposes as provided by law. 
(2)  Referral to public body. The plan commission shall refer the plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration and report. The plan commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency 45 days for reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition. 
(3)  Notice to property owner. Upon receipt of an affirmative report described in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the plan commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the preliminary and final plats those areas proposed to be acquired by the public body. 
(4)  Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land designated on the preliminary or final plat as reserved for acquisition by a public agency shall be instituted in writing by the public agency involved within 18 months of notification to the owner of the property by the plan commission. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plat of the proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to institute acquisition within the prescribed 18 months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for development.

Sec. 14-1239. - Dedication of land for public use. 
(a)  When a final plat of a subdivision has been approved by the common council and/or the town in which the subdivision is located and all other required approvals are obtained and the plat is recorded, that approval shall constitute acceptance for the purpose designated on the plat of all lands shown on the plat as dedicated to the public, including street dedications. 
(b)  Whenever a preliminary plat includes a proposed dedication of land to public use and the plan commission finds that such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the plan commission may either refuse to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of lots in the proposed subdivision to make such land suitable for public dedication. 
(Code 1999, § 14-1-8(d)) 
Sec. 14-1240. - Vacation of plat. 
(a)  Application for vacation. The owner of the subdivision or of any lot in a subdivision or the county board, if the county has acquired an interest in the subdivision or in any lot in the subdivision by tax deed, may apply to the circuit court of the county for the vacation or alteration of all or part of the recorded plat of that subdivision.

DIVISION 4. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 14-1276. - Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. 
    In addition to the design standards established in this division, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, ordinances, rules and regulations: 
(1)  The provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 236. 
(2)  Article II of this chapter pertaining to zoning and all other applicable ordinances of the appropriate jurisdictions. 
(3)  The land use plan, transportation plan, public utilities plan, flood plan map, community facilities plan and official map of the city or any portion thereof.

(5)  The rules of the state department of transportation relating to safety of access and the preservation of the public interest and investment in the streets if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state trunk highway or connecting street. 
(Code 1999, § 14-1-9(a)) 
Sec. 14-1277. - Streets and alleys. 
(a)  General considerations. Streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain features, such as streams and existing tree growth, to public convenience and safety, and in appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. 
(b)  Arrangement. Arrangement shall be as follows: 
(1)  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the official map. 
(2)  All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
(3)  Residential collectors shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems and to require the minimum amount of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
(4)  The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily be adhered to and the use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. 
(5)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(6)  In business and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings; location of rail facilities; and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas and walks and parking areas to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
(c)  Access to minor arterials/collectors. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed minor arterial/collector, the plan commission may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means: 
(1)  A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the minor arterial/collector, such lots to be provided with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line. 
(2)  A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the minor arterial/collector. 
(3)  A residential subcollector or residential access street, separated from the minor arterial/collector by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points. 
(4)  The number of residential collectors entering a minor arterial/collector shall be kept to a minimum. 
(d)  Width of streets. Right-of-way and paving widths of all streets shall be as indicated on the official map, or, if no width is indicated there, shall be not less than the following specified width: 
Back to Back Paving 
(in feet) R.O.W. 
(in feet) Residential access street 32-39* 66 Residential subcollector 32-39* 66 Residential collector 32-39* 66 Minor arterial/collector 39-44* 66-100*  
* The plan commission, upon recommendation of the city engineer, shall establish the definite paving and right-of-way widths, within these ranges, for each particular subdivision.  
(e)  Street grades. The grade of a residential collector shall not exceed six percent unless necessitated by exceptional topography and approved by the plan commission. The grade of all other streets shall not exceed ten percent. The minimum grade of all streets shall be four-tenths of one percent. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks shall not exceed ten percent grade. 
(f)  Vertical curves. All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length in feet equivalent to 15 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of major arterials and one-half of this minimum length for all other streets. No vertical curve less than 50 feet in length is required. 
(g)  Horizontal curves. The minimum horizontal sight distance, with clear visibility measured along the centerline, shall be provided as follows: 
(1)  Minor arterials/collectors, 500 feet. 
(2)  Residential collectors, 300 feet. 
(3)  Residential subcollectors/access, 150 feet. 
(h)  Tangents. A tangent length of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on residential collectors and subcollectors. 
(i)  Culs-de-sac or dead-end streets. Standards for culs-de-sac or dead-end streets are as follows: 
(1)  The use of culs-de-sac in street layouts shall be limited to portions of developments which, due to unusual shape, size, location or topography, may better be served by culs-de-sac than by continuous streets. 
(2)  A cul-de-sac shall not be longer than 300 feet measured on its centerline unless, by reason of topography or other circumstances, the plan commission, upon the recommendation of the city engineer, finds a greater length to be justifiable. 
(3)  The diameter of a cul-de-sac turnaround, measured as the outside right-of-way, shall be not less than 100 feet. 
(j)  Half streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out to eliminate or avoid half streets. Where a half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. Where a new subdivision abuts an existing street of inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width shall be required to be dedicated by the subdivider to meet the requirements of this division. 
(k)  Street intersections. Standards for street intersections shall be as follows: 
(1)  Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 70 degrees shall not be acceptable. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the plan commission. 
(2)  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. Where residential collectors intersect minor arterials/collectors, their alignment shall be continuous. 
(3)  The corner lots at an intersection shall be truncated by straight lines joining points 25 feet back from the property line intersection in each quadrant. Road or street dedications at intersections shall take this form. In cases involving major highways, angular intersections or in any case where more dedications is deemed necessary to provide safe sight distance or for traffic channelization, the plan commission may specify a greater cutoff than the normal cited in this subsection. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(4)  Where the grade of any street at the approach of an intersection exceeds seven percent, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a four-percent grade a distance of 50 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. 
(5)  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the city engineer and plan commission, to provide adequate sight distance. 
(l)  Alleys. Standards for alleys shall be as follows: 
(1)  Alleys shall be provided in all business, commercial and industrial districts, except that the plan commission may waive this requirement where other definite and suitable provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed and in accordance with article II of this chapter pertaining to zoning. 
(2)  The width of alleys shall be not less than 24 feet. 
(3)  Dead-end, crooked and T alleys are prohibited except under very unusual circumstances. Where dead-end alleys are unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end. 
(4)  Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas.

Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. 
(Code 1999, § 14-1-9(c)) 
Sec. 14-1279. - Blocks. 
(a)  Residential blocks. Standards for residential blocks in a subdivision shall be as follows: 
(1)  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to minor arterials/collectors, railroads or waterways. 
(2)  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and type of development contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along minor arterials/collectors shall be not less than 400 feet in length. 
(3)  Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the plan commission through the center of blocks more than 900 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities. 
(b)  Nonresidential blocks. Blocks designed for business, commercial or industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the plan commission for the prospective use. 
(Code 1999, § 14-1-9(d)) 
Sec. 14-1280. - Lots. 
(a)  Zoning limits. In general, the size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.

(b)  Minimum erosion control standards. At a minimum, the following erosion and runoff control standards must be met on all sites described in subsection (a) of this section. Additional or more stringent control standards may be required in those situations where the director of public works and/or city inspector determines that special circumstances due to topography, proximity to watercourses or environmentally sensitive areas justify additional or more stringent controls. The permittee is responsible for obtaining compliance with the required standards. When no permit has been issued, the landowner is responsible for obtaining compliance with the required standards. The land disturbing activities subject to stormwater runoff control are as follows: 
(1)  Temporary best management practice needed for various drainage areas. The following temporary best management practices shall be used to control sediment where erosion of the site, including dirt piles, during construction will result in sediment reaching waters of the state, public sewers or other off-site areas: 
a.  Small drainage areas with overland flow, generally less than one acre. For drainage areas with overland flow, generally less than one acre, a filter fabric fence or equivalent best management practice shall be placed along the downslope areas and along the sideslope areas as required, or the disturbed area shall be properly mulched. 
b.  Drainage areas of two acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow. For drainage areas of two acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow, a filter fabric barrier or equivalent best management practice shall be placed at the downslope point of the disturbed area, or the disturbed area shall be properly mulched. 
c.  Drainage areas of five acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow. For drainage areas of five acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow, a sediment trap or equivalent best management practice shall be placed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
d.  Drainage areas of more than five acres with concentrated or channelized flow. For drainage areas of more than five acres with concentrated or channelized flow, a sediment basin or equivalent best management practice shall be placed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. The basin shall be properly maintained and cleared out when necessary. 
e.  Steep slopes. Slopes of 12 or more percent may require use of additional best management practices. 
(2)  Sequenced activities. All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time and the amount of soil leaving the site. 
(3)  Site stabilization. When the disturbed area is properly stabilized by established vegetation or other permanent means, the temporary best management practices may be removed. 
Note: Permanent best management practices specified in the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook include sodding, seeding, grassed waterway, geotextile reinforced grassed waterway and rock and concrete lined waterway. 
(4)  Tracking minimization. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any significant sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning before the end of each workday. Flushing may not be used unless the sediment will be controlled by a filter fabric barrier, sediment trap, sediment basin or equivalent. 
(5)  Drain inlet protection. Downslope on-site storm drain inlets shall be protected. 
(6)  Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be discharged to an appropriately sized filter fabric barrier, sediment tarp, sediment basin or equivalent best management practice. 
Note: Site dewatering on some sites is covered under the state pollutant discharge elimination system permit program. 
(7)  Sediment cleanup. All off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of a storm event shall be cleaned up by the end of the next workday following the occurrence. All other off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of construction activities shall be immediately cleaned up. 
(8)  Waste and material management and disposal. All waste and unused building materials shall be properly managed and disposed of to prevent pollutants and debris from being carried by runoff off the site. 
(9)  Roof drainage. All roof drainage from permanent buildings shall discharge to pervious surfaces to increase infiltration and reduce increases in runoff except where demonstrated to be infeasible and a written waiver is granted by the director of public works or city inspector. 
(c)  Additional erosion control standards to be met on larger sites. These control standards are in addition to the minimum control standards as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and thus include but are not limited to all sites involving land divisions, subdivisions or certified survey maps, where land divisions, subdivisions or certified survey maps involve either one or more acres or create five or more lots or building sites, or all sites where one or more acres are disturbed at a time, where special circumstances due to topography, proximity to water covers or relation to environmentally sensitive lands make the disturbance a major one, and shall meet the added control plan requirements as set up by the director of public works or city inspector. These requirements may include required public dedication of water runoff control measures. The permittee is responsible for obtaining compliance with the control plan requirements. Informal guidelines for the control plan for a major land disturbing activity are on file in the zoning administrator's office and are incorporated as a part of this article as an addendum. 
(d)  Special circumstances. The control standards set forth in this article are intended to apply on a typical development site. When land disturbing and/or development activity is proposed for a site with extraordinary features, the plan commission may recommend to the common council and the council, at its discretion, will require additional and/or more restrictive control standards and measures before any control plan is approved or permit is issued. Extraordinary sites include but are not limited to sites where land disturbing or development activities are proposed to occur on slopes of more than 12-percent grade in designated floodplain, wetland or conservancy areas or in environmental corridor areas identified in the city master plan. 
(e)  Land disturbing activities subject to stormwater runoff control. Land disturbing activities subject to stormwater runoff control are as follows: 
(1)  Land disturbing activities on public lands and on all private lands shall be subject to the runoff control subsections of this section, if: 
a.  The activity will be a residential development having less than 50 percent impervious area, disturbing more than five acres. 
b.  The activity will be a residential development having more than 50 percent impervious area, disturbing more than three acres. 
c.  The activity will be a nonresidential development, disturbing more than three acres; or 
d.  A parking lot of one acre or more; or 
e.  In the opinion of the director of public works, the runoff from the land disturbing activity will create a hazard by exceeding the safe capacity of the receiving water body in the area, will cause undue channel erosion or an undue increase in water pollution by increased scour and transport of particles or will otherwise endanger the downstream property owners or their property. Safe capacity is defined as the rate of flow that can be handled without flooding. 
(2)  The owner, land occupier or land user shall be in compliance with subsection (e)(1) of this section if he/she follows the procedure of this section and receives from the director of public works an approved control plan and a permit before commencement of any land disturbing activities on lands subject to control under this section. 
(f)  Standards for stormwater runoff control for land disturbing activities. Standards for stormwater runoff control for land disturbing activities are as follows: 
(1)  Land disturbing activities subject to runoff control regulation as described in this article shall meet the corresponding requirements of the following: 
a.  Residential and other nonindustrial and noncommercial certified surveys shall incorporate the following stormwater control measures: 
1.  All roof drainage shall discharge to either: 
i.  Pervious surfaces with an overland flow distance of at least 30 feet. 
ii.  An infiltration device. 
2.  All driveways shall slope to adjacent lawns to the extent practicable. 
3.  Where conditions are such that the depth to the water table is three feet or greater during at least nine months of the year, the stormwater drainage system for the development shall include grassed swales for area drainage and underground perforated drainage pipe for storm runoff conveyance. The applicant shall be responsible for documentation for areas to be exempted from these measures. Where the director of public works finds this to be impracticable, conveyance shall be by traditional means. 
b.  Industrial sites of less than 100,000 square feet and nonindustrial paved parking and storage areas with surface areas totaling 5,000 to 500,000 square feet shall discharge to one or more grit chambers or oil and grease traps. Each grit chamber or oil and grease trap shall be designed to remove all particles greater than 100 microns in size and shall be cleaned at least once every three months. The pumped liquids from cleaning shall be discharged to a licensed wastewater treatment plant. 
c.  Industrial sites of more than 100,000 square feet, nonindustrial paved parking lots and storage areas greater than 500,000 square feet and industrial roofs larger than 10,000 square feet shall discharge to one or more wet detention basins. These basins shall have an aggregate area, respectively, of at least 1.5 percent of the contributing surface area of the industrial site or three percent of the contributing paved industrial areas, whichever is greater; at least three percent of the nonindustrial paved area draining to it; and at least three percent of the industrial roof area draining to it. These basins shall have a permanent pool depth of three feet and shall be excavated periodically as needed to maintain the three-foot depth. 
(2)  Regardless of proposed land use the proposed development shall: 
a.  Not increase peak flow rates of storm runoff from that which would have resulted from the same storm occurring over the site with the land in its predevelopment condition, for storms of 24-hour duration and recurrence intervals of two, five, ten, 25, 50 and 100 years; and 
b.  The volume of storm runoff resulting from the ten-year storm of 24-hour duration shall not be greater after development than would have resulted from the same storm occurring over the site with the land in its predevelopment condition. 
c.  Where subsections (f)(2)a and/or (f)(2)b of this section are found to be unacceptable or inevitable on the proposed site by the director of public works, the applicant shall specify an off-site area to meet the provision and provide a suitable alternative determined in negotiation with the director of public works. 
(g)  Erosion and runoff control by public dedication of water runoff control. The common council may require dedication of water runoff control measures. When such dedication is required, the dedicated land may also be utilized for parkland and for recreational use. Once dedicated and accepted, the city shall maintain the runoff control measures as necessary to adhere to this article and any other applicable laws or contracts. The potential costs of maintaining proposed runoff control measures will be among the criteria considered in both accepting or rejecting an entire erosion and runoff control plan for the areas and determining whether to require dedication to the city of all runoff control measures. If the city does not require dedication of any water runoff control measures, the continued maintenance of such measures shall be ensured through such means as deed restrictions, easements or a contract with the city.

Upon payment of the required kennel license tax and, if required by the common council, upon presentation of evidence that all dogs over five months of age are currently immunized against rabies, the clerk-treasurer shall issue the kennel license and a number of tags equal to the number of dogs authorized to be kept in the kennel. Kennels may only be located in residential areas following a public hearing and approval by the common council; the common council may attach conditions to such approval as a conditional use under article II of chapter 14 pertaining to zoning. 
(3)  The owner or keeper of a kennel shall keep at all times a kennel license tag attached to the collar of each dog over five months old kept by the owner or keeper under a kennel license, but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition, to a dog securely confined indoors or to a dog securely confined in a fenced area.

Expressly incorporated by reference in this section as minimum standards for kennel keepers or operator are the relevant provisions of statutes. 
(5)  A condition of a kennel license shall be that the licensed premises may be entered and inspected at any reasonable hour by appropriate city officials without any warrant, and the application for a license under this subsection (b) shall be deemed a consent to this condition. Any refusal to permit such inspection shall automatically operate as a revocation of any license issued under this subsection (b) and shall be deemed a violation of this section. Should any kennel be found to constitute a public nuisance, the license shall be revoked and the nuisance abated pursuant to ordinance. 
(Code 1999, § 7-1-3) 
Sec. 18-36. - Dog license late fee.

(2)  Health risk to humans. If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal under strict isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at least ten days after the incident occurred.

If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal and if the dog or cat is not currently immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for 180 days. Then the owner shall have the animal examined by a veterinarian and vaccinated against rabies.

The owner shall have the animal revaccinated against rabies as soon as possible after exposure to a rabid animal.

If the dog or cat is suspected to have bitten a person, the veterinarian shall notify the person or the person's physician. 
(e)  Delivery of carcass; preparation; examination by laboratory of hygiene. An officer who kills an animal shall deliver the carcass to a veterinarian or local health department. The veterinarian shall prepare the carcass, properly prepare and package the head of the animal in a manner to minimize deterioration, arrange for delivery by the most expeditious means feasible of the head of the animal to the state laboratory of hygiene and dispose of or arrange for the disposal of the remainder of the carcass in a manner which minimizes the risk or exposure to any rabies virus. The laboratory of hygiene shall examine the specimen and determine if the animal was infected with rabies. The state laboratory of hygiene shall notify the local health department, which will in turn notify the appropriate parties. 
(f)  Cooperation of veterinarian. Any practicing veterinarian who is requested to be involved in the rabies control program by an officer is encouraged to cooperate in a professional capacity with the city, the laboratory of hygiene, the local health department, the officer involved and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, the person's physician. 
(g)  Responsibility for quarantine and laboratory expenses.

Further, the council, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one year or more.

    The presence of underage persons on a licensed premises as provided under Wis. Stats. § 125.07(3)(a)10 shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  The licensee or agent of a corporate licensee shall notify the police department at least 48 hours in advance of the date of any event at which underage persons will be present on the licensed premises. Each such nonalcohol event notice shall specify the date on which the event is to occur and the time of commencement. All notices shall be filed with the police department during normal working hours (8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday) and shall be given on forms prescribed by the department. After a nonalcohol event notice has been given, the licensee may cancel an event only by giving like notice to the department in accordance with this subsection. Regardless of the date given, all notices shall expire and shall be deemed cancelled no later than the date of expiration or revocation of the applicable retail class "B" or "class B" license. 
(2)  During the period of any nonalcohol event, a notice card prescribed by the police department shall be posted at all public entrances to the licensed premises notifying the general public that no alcohol beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises during the event.

All beer taps and automatic dispensers of alcohol beverages (referred to as "speed guns") shall be either disconnected, disabled or made inoperable. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-18) 
Sec. 18-100. - Outdoor beer gardens and sports activities. 
(a)  Purpose. The common council finds that restrictions are necessary for outdoor beer gardens and sports activities at premises holding "class B" and class "B" liquor and fermented malt beverages licenses due to concerns arising from noise, density and related problems. This section, enacted pursuant to police power, provides a framework for regulatory controls on such outdoor sports and beer garden activities. 
(b)  Approval. Approval is required as follows: 
(1)  Generally. No licensee shall conduct or sponsor any outdoor sports activity or event or beer garden on property forming any part of the real property on which the licensed premises exist without the prior approval of the common council. 
(2)  Permit required for beer garden outdoor consumption. No licensee shall permit the consumption of alcohol beverages on any part of the licensed premises not enclosed within the building, except under a beer garden permit granted by the common council. The permits are a privilege in which no rights vest and, therefore, may be revoked by the common council at its pleasure at any time or shall otherwise expire on June 30 of each year. No person shall consume or have in his/her possession alcohol beverages on any unenclosed part of a licensed premises which is not described in a valid beer garden permit. 
(c)  Application. If a licensee shall conduct or sponsor any outdoor sports activity or event or beer garden on the licensee's property, the licensee shall file an application with the clerk-treasurer setting forth the following information: 
(1)  The name, address and telephone number of the person who will be responsible for the actual conduct of the activity or event; 
(2)  The date and duration of time for the proposed activity or event; 
(3)  An accurate description of that portion of the licensee's property proposed to be used; 
(4)  A good faith estimate of the number of users, participants and spectators for the beer garden or proposed activity or event; and 
(5)  The licensee's plan for maintaining the cleanliness of the licensed area. 
(d)  Time for filing; fee. The licensee shall file the application not less than 15 days before the date of the proposed activity or event. The common council may waive the 15-day time limit upon a licensee's showing of exigent circumstances. The application shall be accompanied by payment of a fee as prescribed in section 1-22 for review of the application. The applicant may request that an annual permit be issued for the beer garden or outdoor sports activities. 
(e)  Review. The common council shall review the applications in light of the standards of this section. If the nature of the property or the event requires the imposition of additional regulations, the common council may impose these regulations upon an express finding detailing the reasons for additional regulation. All property owners within 150 feet of the proposed beer garden or outside sports facility shall be notified of the pendency of the application for a permit by first class mail. 
(f)  Outdoor sports activity standards. The following standards shall apply to any outdoor sports activity regulated under this section: 
(1)  Approval of an application shall not act to permit outdoor consumption of alcohol beverages on the property beyond the area specifically licensed. 
(2)  If the estimated number of participants and spectators shall bring the number of persons on the property above the number for which the licensed premises' restroom facilities are rated adequate, the licensee shall provide a number of portable temporary restrooms sufficient to serve the estimated number of persons. 
(3)  The common council shall not grant approval to any applicant whose property on which the activity or event is proposed is adjacent to any property zoned residential or on which a residential use exists as a nonconforming use or within 100 feet of any property zoned residential or on which a residential use exists as a nonconforming use. Fencing may be required. 
(4)  The applicant shall provide parking adequate for the proposed activity or event, whether on-site or through agreements with property owners shown to the common council's satisfaction to permit their property to be used for parking for the proposed activity or event. 
(5)  The applicant shall show the common council plans adequate to provide reasonable access to participants and spectators for the event and to limit access for all other persons. 
(6)  The licensee shall clean up all garbage and debris relating to the activity or event at least once per 24 hours during the activity or event. 
(7)  The licensee shall not permit the noise level of the sports activity or event to exceed 75 dB, measured at any border of the licensee's real property. 
(g)  Limitations on issuance of beer garden permits. The following are the limitations on the issuance of beer garden permits: 
(1)  No permit shall be issued for a beer garden if any part of the beer garden is within 100 feet of a structure used for residential purposes, except residential uses located in the same structure as the licensed premises. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued for a beer garden if the beer garden area is greater than 50 percent of the gross floor area of the adjoining licensed premises. Each applicant for a beer garden permit shall accurately describe the area intended for use as a beer garden and shall indicate the nature of fencing or other measures intended to provide control over the operation of the beer garden. 
(3)  Every beer garden shall be completely enclosed with a fence or wall not less than six feet in height. 
(4)  No amplified sound or music is permitted outside the enclosed (building) premises. Dancing or amplified sound or music is not permitted in the beer garden. 
(5)  There shall be a licensed operator with the beer garden at all times the beer garden is in operation. 
(6)  The only entrance to the outdoor portion of the licensed premises shall be solely through the entrance to the principal tavern, restaurant or other described portion of the licensed premises located in a building or structure. 
(h)  State statutes enforced within beer garden. Every permittee under this section shall comply with and enforce all provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 125 applicable to class "B" licensed premises, except insofar as such provisions are clearly inapplicable. Violation of the provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 125 shall be grounds for immediate revocation of the outdoor sports activity or beer garden permit by the common council. 
(i)  Violations. Failure of the licensee to comply with any of the subsections of this section shall be grounds for suspension, nonrenewal or revocation of the licensee's alcohol beverage license. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-19) 
Sec. 18-101. - Nude dancing in licensed establishments. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Licensed establishment means any establishment licensed by the common council to sell alcohol beverages pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
    Licensee means the holder of a retail "class A," "class B," class "B," class "A" or "class C" license granted by the common council pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
(b)  Penalties. Any person who violates any of the subsections of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture pursuant to section 1-14. A separate offense and violation shall be deemed committed on each day on which a violation occurs or continues. In addition, violation of this section constitutes sufficient grounds for suspending, revoking or nonrenewing an alcohol beverage license under Wis. Stats. § 125.12. 
(c)  Authority. The findings and authority for this section are as follows: 
(1)  The common council has explicit authority under Wis. Stats. § 125.10(1) to adopt regulations governing the sale of alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth in Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
(2)  The common council has authority under its general police powers set forth in Wis. Stats. § 62.11(5) to act for the good order of the city and for the health, safety and welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression; 
(3)  The common council recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity in light of Wis. Stats. § 66.051(3) and does not intend by adopting this section to regulate obscenity. Since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, it declares its intent to enact this section addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns; 
(4)  Bars and taverns featuring live totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and order of the communities, to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities; and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens; 
(5)  The common council recognizes the U.S. Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the First Amendment, and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights; 
(6)  However, the common council is aware, based on the experiences of other communities, that bars and taverns in which live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city; 
(7)  Among these secondary effects are the following: 
a.  The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses; 
b.  The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist; 
c.  Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and 
d.  The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct; 
(8)  The common council desires to minimize, prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight; and 
(9)  The common council has determined that enactment of this section prohibiting live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages promotes the goal of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity. 
(d)  Prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to perform or engage in or for any licensee or manager or agent of the licensee to permit any person, employee, entertainer or patron to perform or engage in any live act, demonstration, dance or exhibition on the premises of a licensed establishment which: 
(1)  Shows his/her genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal cleft or cleavage with less than a fully opaque covering; 
(2)  Shows any portion of the female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; or 
(3)  Shows the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state. 
(e)  Exemptions. This section does not apply to the following licensed establishments; theaters, performing arts centers, civic centers, and dinner theaters where live dance, ballet, music and dramatic performances of serious artistic merit are offered on a regular basis and in which the predominant business or attraction is not the offering to customers of entertainment which is intended to provide sexual stimulation or sexual gratification to such customers and where the establishment is not distinguished by an emphasis on or the advertising or promotion of employees engaging in nude erotic dancing. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-20) 
Sec. 18-102. - Online ordering and curbside pickup of alcohol beverages. 
(a)  No establishment shall allow online purchase of alcohol beverages and curbside delivery of such purchases ("click and collect"), without first obtaining an "extension of premises" for the license from the Antigo Common Council, upon recommendation of the finance, personnel and legislative committee (FPL) to license that portion of the establishment's parking lot that will allow vehicles to park for purposes of picking up their online order. 
(1)  The licensed establishment shall file a detailed operation plan with their "extension of premises" request that clearly details how their "click and collect" operation will function. The operation plan shall include the licensee's protocol for assuring that underage persons and intoxicated persons do not pick up alcohol via the "click and collect" program. 
(2)  Failure of licensee to provide a detailed operation plan with their "extension of premises" request shall result in the City of Antigo Clerk's office not forwarding the "extension of premises" request to FP and L for consideration. 
(b)  No establishment holding an alcohol beverage license shall allow online purchase and pickup of alcohol beverages unless the sale is consummated on the licensed premises. 
(1)  Payment for the purchase must be completed on-premises and may not be completed until the purchaser is at the licensed premises and has presented valid photo identification that has been verified by a licensed operator employed by the premises. 
(2)  The licensed operator must verify that the person placing the "click and collect" order is the same person picking up the order. 
(3)  The sale and delivery of "click and collect" purchases shall be made only by a licensed operator. 
(4)  No alcohol sales are permitted if the purchaser fails to present valid photo identification. 
(5)  The "click and collect" system must allow the purchase of alcohol to be denied without affecting the remainder of the purchase. 
(c)  Each "click and collect" transaction must capture and retain an image of the vehicle and vehicle's license plate into which the order is being loaded for 30 days. 
(d)  Pickup of "click and collect" orders shall be between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. 
(e)  Orders containing alcohol placed after 4:00 p.m. cannot be picked up until the following day. 
(f)  The pickup area for "click and collect" purchases shall be clearly defined with visible markings, signs, and/or barriers. 
(g)  No events other than the delivery of "click and collect" orders shall be allowed on the expanded premises. 
(h)  Penalty. Any licensee or person who violates any provision of this subsection shall be subject to forfeiture as determined by the general penalty provision of the city Code of Ordinances section 1-14.

DIVISION 2. - OPERATOR'S LICENSE 

Sec. 18-131. - Required. 
(a)  Class "A," class "B" or "class C" premises. Except as provided under Wis. Stats. §§ 125.32(3)(b) and 125.07(3)(a)10, no premises operated under a class "A," class "B" or "class C" license or permit may be open for business unless there is upon the premises the licensee or permittee, the agent named in the license or permit if the licensee or permittee is a corporation or some person who has an operator's license and who is responsible for the acts of all persons serving any fermented malt beverages to customers. An operator's license issued in respect to a vessel under Wis. Stats. § 125.27(2) is valid outside the municipality that issues it. For the purpose of this section, any person holding a manager's license under Wis. Stats. § 125.18 or any member of the licensee's or permittee's immediate family who has attained the age of 18 shall be considered the holder of an operator's license. No person, including a member of the licensee's or permittee's immediate family, other than the licensee, permittee or agent, may serve fermented malt beverages in any place operated under a class "A," class "B," or "class C" license or permit unless he/she has an operator's license or is at least 18 years of age and is under the immediate supervision of the licensee, permittee, agent or a person holding an operator's license who is on the premises at the time of the service. 
(b)  Use by another prohibited. 
(1)  No person may allow another to use his/her class "A" or class "B" license or permit to sell alcohol beverages. 
(2)  The license or permit of a person who violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be revoked.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, Wis. Stats. §§ 125.17 and 125.32. 
Sec. 18-132. - Procedure upon application. 
(a)  The common council may issue an operator's license required under this division upon application in writing on forms to be obtained from the clerk-treasurer only to persons 18 years of age or older. An operator's license shall be operative only within the limits of the city. 
(b)  All applications are subject to an investigation by the chief of police and/or other appropriate authority to determine whether the applicant to be licensed complies with all regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto. The police department shall conduct an investigation of the applicant, including but not limited to requesting information from the state, surrounding municipalities and/or any community where the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. Based upon such investigation, the chief of police shall recommend, in writing, to the common council approval or denial of the application. If the chief of police recommends denial, the chief of police shall provide, in writing, the reasons for such recommendation. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-31) 
Sec. 18-133. - Duration. 
    A standard operator's license issued under this division shall be valid for a period of two years and shall expire on June 30. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-32) 
Sec. 18-134. - Fee; provisional or temporary licenses. 
(a)  Fee. The fee for a standard operator's license issued under this division, for reissuance of the license and for renewals of the license shall be as prescribed in section 1-22. The fee for a provisional operator's license shall be as provided in section 1-22. 
(b)  Provisional license. The clerk-treasurer may issue a provisional operator's license in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 125.17(5). The provisional operator's license shall expire 60 days after its issuance or when an operator's license is issued to the holder, whichever is sooner. The clerk-treasurer may, upon receiving an application for a temporary provisional license, issue such a license without requiring the successful completion of the approved program as described in this division. However, such temporary license shall be used only for the purpose of allowing such applicant the privilege of being licensed as a beverage operator pending his/her successful completion of the approved program. A provisional license may not be issued to any person who has been denied an operator's license by the common council or who has had his/her operator's license revoked or suspended within the preceding 12 months. The clerk-treasurer shall provide an appropriate application form to be completed in full by the applicant. The clerk-treasurer may revoke the provisional license issued if he/she discovers that the holder of the license made a false statement on the application. Following completion of the responsible beverage server training course and notification from the school, the license application will be presented to the council, with the appropriate fee as prescribed in subsection (a) of this section for an operators license. If approved by the council, the operator's license is issued. 
(c)  Temporary license. The clerk-treasurer may issue a temporary operator's license, at no fee, provided that: 
(1)  This license may be issued only to operators employed by or donating their services to nonprofit corporations. 
(2)  No person may hold more than one license of this kind per year. 
(3)  The license is valid for any period from one day to 14 days, and the period for which it is valid shall be stated on the license. 
(Code 1999, § 7-2-33; Ord. No. 1049B, § 1, 7-11-2001) 
Sec. 18-135. - Issuance or denial. 
(a)  After the common council approves the granting of an operator's license under this division, the clerk-treasurer shall issue the license. Such licenses shall be issued and numbered in the order they are granted and shall give the applicant's name and address and the date of the expiration of such license. 
(1)  If the application is denied by the common council, the clerk-treasurer shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the denial, the reasons therefor and of the opportunity to request a reconsideration of the application by the common council in a closed session. Such notice must be sent by certified mail to or served upon the applicant at least ten days prior to the council's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration hearing, the applicant may present evidence and testimony as to why the license should be granted. 
(2)  If, upon reconsideration, the council again denies the application, the clerk-treasurer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to circuit court pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 125.12(2)(d) for review. 
(b)  Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on the following: 
(1)  Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by Wis. Stats. §§ 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335; 
(2)  The financial responsibility of the applicant; and 
(3)  Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. 
If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity, the common council may act to revoke or suspend the license. 
(d)  An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony, unless duly pardoned, or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, the term "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the common council, the common council reserves the right to consider the severity and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the common council, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one year or more.

(1)  The person is renewing an operator's license. 
(2)  Within the past two years, the person held a class "A," class "B," "class A," "class B" or "class C" license or permit or a manager's or operator's license.

    Article means any item of value, excluding clothing items. 
    Reportable transaction means every transaction conducted by a pawnbroker, secondhand article and jewelry dealers in which an article or articles are received through a pawn, purchase, consignment, or trade, or in which a pawn is renewed, extended, voided, or redeemed, or for which a unique transaction number or identifier is generated by their point-of-sale software, and is reportable except: 
(1)  The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used articles from a merchant, manufacturer, or wholesale having an established permanent place of business, and the retail sale of said articles, provided the pawnbroker must maintain a record of such purchase or consignment that describes each item, and must mark each item in a manner that related it to that transaction record.

(b)  When digital photos are required.

One group photo shall suffice for mass items such as several coins acquired in one transaction. If a photograph is taken, it must be at least two inches in length by two inches in width and must be maintained in such a manner that the photograph can be readily matched and correlated with all other records of the transaction to which they relate. Such photographs must be available to the chief of police, or the chief's designee, upon request. Items photographed must be accurately depicted and submitted as digital images, in a format specified by the issuing authority, electronically cross-referenced to the reportable transaction they are associated with. Entries of required digital images shall be retained a minimum of six months.

The pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer must display a sign of sufficient size in a conspicuous place on the premises, which informs all patrons that al transactions are reported daily to the police department. 
(2)  If a pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer is unable to successfully transfer the required reports by modem, the pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer must provide the police department with printed copies of all reportable transactions by 12:00 noon the next business day. 
(3)  If the problem is determined to be in the pawnbroker's or secondhand article and jewelry dealer's system and is not corrected by the close of the first business day following the failure, the pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer must provide the required reports as detailed in state statute, and shall be charged a daily reporting failure fee of $10.00 until the error is corrected, or, if the problem is determined to be outside the pawnbroker's or secondhand article and jewelry dealer's system, the pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer must provide the required reports pursuant to state statute and resubmit all such transactions via modem when the error is corrected. 
(4)  Regardless of the cause or origin of the technical problems that prevented the pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer from uploading the reportable transactions, upon correction of the problem, the pawnbroker or secondhand article and jewelry dealer shall upload every reportable transaction from every business day the problem has existed. 
(5)  The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, the police department may, upon presentation of extenuating circumstances, delay the implementation of the daily reporting penalty. 
(6)  Pawnbroker means any person who engages in the business of lending money on the deposit or pledge of any article or purchasing any article with an expressed or implied agreement or understanding to sell it back at a subsequent time at a stipulated price.

The investigative hold shall be confirmed in writing by the originating agency within 72 hours and will remain in effect for 15 days from the date of initial notification, or until the investigative order is cancelled, or until an order to confiscate is issued.

ARTICLE V. - ALARM SYSTEMS 

Sec. 30-136. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish control of the various types of intrusion, holdup, fire extinguishment, smoke detection and other emergency signals from telephone or electronic devices that would require police or fire response at the location of an event reported by a signal which is transmitted by telephone or radio or which is otherwise relayed to the emergency communications center by a signal actuated by an automated alarm device, including such devices already in use within the city. Both society in general and public safety in particular will be aided by providing a useful and usable system of private security which properly balances quick response by law enforcement with minimization of enforcement time spent on alarms which are false or otherwise not the intended function of private security systems. 
(Code 1999, § 5-4-2(a)) 
Sec. 30-137. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Government exempted. None of the sections of this article shall apply to any official government body or subdivision thereof which owns, operates and maintains its own alarm equipment.

Sec. 30-143. - Fee for answering alarms. 
(a)  Generally. Each false alarm requires response of public safety personnel, involves unnecessary expense to the city, increases the risk of injury to persons or damage to property and dilutes the overall public safety protection to the city. Such false alarms constitute a public nuisance and must be abated. 
(b)  Intentional activation. No person shall intentionally cause the activation of a burglar/fire alarm device knowing that no criminal activity, fire or other emergency exists. 
(c)  False alarm administrative charges. False alarm administrative charges shall be as follows:

Separate accounts shall be kept for false alarms of criminal activity and false alarms for fire or other emergencies. 
(2)  Subsection (c) of this section is intended to impose a strict liability on the person or other entity responsible for alarm connection to either the police alarm panel or to an alarm receiving firm to which the police or fire department has responded and shall be applied regardless of the cause of the false alarm, excepting those alarms excluded from the definition of the term "false alarm." Failure to pay such administrative charge in and of itself shall constitute a violation of this section, and such charge shall be collectible as a forfeiture upon prosecution and conviction thereof, together with an additional forfeiture which may be imposed under subsection (e) of this section for violation of this section for allowing or maintaining conditions or acts violative of the intent of this section of eliminating and minimizing the occurrence of false alarms, together with costs of prosecution. 
(d)  Waiver of fee. If a possessor of the alarm shows to the satisfaction of the chief of police or the fire chief, as applicable, that such false alarm was not the result of negligence or improper maintenance or other good and sufficient cause beyond the reasonable control of the possessor of the alarm, such fee may be waived, and the response shall not count as a false alarm in computing the fee established under subsection (c) of this section. 
(e)  Other violations. Any person violating this article in any manner, other than for collection of unpaid administrative charges treated in subsection (c) of this section, shall be subject to forfeiture as provided in section 1-14.

(f)  Default of payment for forfeiture and/or costs. Upon nonpayment of the fee, the amount due may be placed on the tax roll as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(Code 1999, § 5-4-8) 
Sec. 30-144. - City liability. 
    The city shall be under no duty or obligation to a subscriber or to any other person concerning any section of this article, including but not limited to any defects in an alarm system or any delays in transmission or response to any alarm; however, this in no way shall be construed that it is not the proper function of law enforcement to respond to alarms.

(3)  Public hearing. No proposed change or addition to the official map shall become effective until after a public hearing before the common council at which interested parties and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of such public hearing shall be published under Wis. Stats. § 62.23(6)(g) in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(4)  Interpretation. Such additions and changes, when adopted, shall become a part of the official map of the city and shall be final and conclusive with respect to the location and width of the streets, highways, sidewalks and parkways and the location and extent of the parks and playgrounds shown on the map. The placing of any street, highway, parkway, park or playground line upon the official map shall not in and of itself constitute the opening or establishment of any street, highway, parkway, park or playground or the taking or acceptance of any land for such purposes. 
(5)  Changes. The location, widening or closing or the approval of the location, widening or closing of any streets, highways, sidewalks, parkways, parks or playgrounds by the city under provisions of law other than this section shall be deemed to be a change or addition to the official map and shall be subject to this section. However, changes or additions resulting from the approval by the city of a subdivision plat shall not require the public hearing specified in subsection (g)(3) of this section if the changes or additions do not affect any land outside the platted area. 
(h)  Appeals. Procedures for appeals are as follows: 
(1)  Authority of board of appeals. The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals from the decisions of the civil technologist/surveyor and the building inspector for the following only: 
a.  If the land within the exterior lines of a mapped, but not existing, street, highway, parkway, park or playground cannot yield a fair return, the board of appeals may, by vote of a majority of its members, grant a permit for a building or structure within the exterior lines of such street, highway, parkway, park or playground. However, the board may impose reasonable requirements as a condition for granting such permit. Such requirements shall be designed to promote the health, convenience, safety and general welfare of the community and to ensure a minimal cost of future opening of such street, highway, parkway, park or playground. The board of appeals shall refuse a permit where the applicant will not be substantially damaged by placing his/her building or structure outside the mapped street, highway, parkway, park or playground. 
b.  Where the enforcement of subsection (f)(3)b of this section would entail practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship and where the circumstances of the case do not require the structure to be related to existing or proposed streets, highways or parkways, the applicant for such permit may appeal from the decision of the city inspector to the board of appeals. The board, in passing on such appeal, may make any reasonable exception and issue the permit subject to conditions that will protect any future street, highway or parkway layout. 
(2)  Procedure for appeal. Appeals shall be taken by filing with the city inspector a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The city inspector shall immediately transmit to the board of appeals all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(3)  Public hearing. Before taking any action authorized in this subsection (h), the board of appeals shall hold a public hearing at which interested parties and others shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of such public hearing shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing. Any decision shall be subject to review by certiorari issued by a court of record.

If the property owner elects to have the work done by his/her own contractor or if the property owner is a property tax-exempt entity (example: religious institutions, schools, government-owned parcels, etc.), the property owner shall pay the full cost thereof. 
a.  A deviation from the Code is authorized so that the city may pay up to 100 percent of the cost to allow for the infill or extension of various sidewalks within the city and considered a high priority, installing some each year until they are all completed. A list of locations affected is on file in the city clerk's office and is depicted on the official street map of the city. (For purposes of this section infill is defined as the completion of one or two missing lots to complete a sidewalk in a particular block and designated by the council as a priority.) 
b.  Any new construction or renovation equal to 50 percent or more of the existing structures on a property not served by a sidewalk but designated as a priority will be required to construct a sidewalk in accordance with the conditions of subsection (g)(3). 
(4)  If the cost of such sidewalk repair exceeds $100.00, it may at the election of the taxpayer be placed on the tax roll and paid over a five-year period with interest as established by the common council. 
(f)  Concrete sidewalk contractors. The following applies to concrete sidewalk contractors:

(2)  Grade of sidewalks. The director of public works shall, upon granting the permit, determine the lines and grades of the walk and cause proper stakes to be set to designate the grades on an offset line. Until such stakes are set, the construction of the walk, except the excavation therefor, shall not be commenced. 
(3)  Damage to sidewalk grade stakes. No person shall, without authority in writing from the director of public works, interfere with, alter the position or level of, remove or destroy any line or grade stakes set by the director of public works or by his/her authority before the walk is built in accordance therewith. 
(4)  Slope of sidewalks. Unless otherwise specified by the director of public works, the slope of all sidewalks shall be one-quarter inch per foot and shall slope toward the street, and the height of such walk at the outer edge shall be determined by the director of public works in accordance with the grade of the street or sidewalk established by the common council. If no grade has been established, the height shall be determined by the director of public works in such manner as shall, in his/her judgment, make the grade conform with the property height of the street and adjoining sidewalks for street improvement purposes. 
(h)  Widths of sidewalks. Widths of sidewalks shall be as follows: 
(1)  Standard widths. The widths of sidewalks on all streets and parts of streets, other than those for which different widths are prescribed, shall be five feet. 
(2)  Widths of certain streets. Widths of sidewalks on certain streets shall be as follows:

(4)  Passages to curb. The owner of the premises may, when constructing a sidewalk in front of the premises, extend a portion of the sidewalk to the curb at a place where persons will be alighting from vehicles. Nothing contained in this subsection (e)(4) shall prevent the extension of a private driveway to the curb. 
(i)  Thickness of concrete sidewalks. The thickness of all concrete sidewalks shall be six inches. 
(j)  Standard concrete sidewalk specifications. Standards for concrete sidewalks shall be as follows: 
(1)  Concrete construction required.

h.  The committee may amend these specifications at any time, provided that such amendment shall not conflict with any of the subsections of this section. 
(3)  Specifications. Specifications shall be as follows: 
a.  Mix design. Concrete shall be machine mixed in the ratio of one volume of Portland cement, 21/4 volumes of sand and three volumes of coarse aggregate. There shall not be less than six gallons of water, including that contained in the aggregates, used per sack of Portland cement. 
b.  Excavation and sub-base. 
1.  The base will be prepared by excavating to the required elevation of the bottom of the base. All soft or unsuitable material will be removed and replaced with suitable material. Twenty-four inches of granular backfill material will be placed under the new six-inch driveway approach. These courses will be compacted thoroughly, wetting or driving as needed to secure at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density at optimum moisture. The base will be finished to a firm, true surface and moistened immediately before the concrete is placed. The base will be sufficiently wide enough to permit placing of forms and performing the required work. All base material will be furnished by the contractor. 
2.  The contractor shall be responsible for all damage done to water shutoffs in the process of excavation or sidewalk construction and will be charged by the city for any repairs to water shutoffs. If the water shutoff falls into the sidewalk line, there shall be installed a Hudson box to protect the shutoff. The Hudson box can be purchased from the city; however, installation of the box will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
3.  The contractor shall also be responsible for all iron property stakes. If an iron property stake is damaged or removed, the contractor shall hire a registered land surveyor to have the stake replaced. If this is not done, the city will hire the registered land surveyor and charge either the contractor or the abutting property on which the sidewalk was installed. 
c.  Base. There shall be installed 24 inches of granular backfill material under the sidewalk. Such base shall be leveled and thoroughly tamped to a uniform grade. 
d.  Forms. Forms shall be of wood or metal and shall be straight and of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement during the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete. If of wood, forms shall be surfaced plank of at least two inches nominal thickness stock; if of metal, they shall be of an approved section and shall have a flat surface on top. The forms shall be six inches in depth of the new sidewalk. They shall be securely staked, braced and held firmly to the required line yard grade and shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar. All forms shall be cleaned thoroughly and oiled before the concrete is placed against them. The construction of sidewalks without forms is prohibited. 
e.  Placing and finishing concrete. Standards for the placing and finishing of concrete are as follows: 
1.  The subgrade and forms shall be checked and approved by the director of public works or his/her designee before the concrete is placed. The concrete shall be placed on a moist subgrade, deposited to the proper depth and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to the surface, after which it shall be struck off and floated. Before the mortar has set, the surface shall be steel troweled and given a brushed finish with a clean bristly brush. The finished surface must be uniformly smooth in appearance. Edging tools shall be used on all of the joints and along the edges of the walk. Sprinkling of cement on the surface of the concrete to absorb water or to hasten hardening is prohibited. The sprinkling or adding of water to the surface of the concrete to aid in troweling or finishing the sidewalk shall be prohibited. 
2.  No concrete shall be placed on a frozen base or subgrade. 
3.  The concrete shall have a maximum slump of four inches when placed. 
f.  Joints. Contraction joints shall be placed at intervals of five feet at right angles to the centerline of the sidewalk. Contraction joints shall be tooled or sawed to a depth of one-quarter the total depth of the sidewalk or to a depth of one inch for a four-inch-thick walk and a depth of 11/4 inches for a six-inch-thick sidewalk. A one-half-inch expansion joint shall be placed at intervals of 60 feet or wherever the new sidewalk abuts a curb, a building or rigid structure. The joint filler shall be placed to completely separate the sidewalk, and the top of the filler shall be slightly below the finished surface of the sidewalk. The concrete at the faces of all joints shall be thoroughly spaded and compacted to fill the voids. The edges of the sidewalk along forms, joints and metal slab division forms shall be rounded with an edger of one-quarter inch radius. Joints shall not be sealed. 
g.  Adjusting sidewalk to private entrance walks and driveways. Where existing concrete and asphalt entrance walks or asphalt driveways extend into the new sidewalk line, the contractor shall saw cut the concrete or asphalt on a line designated by the director of public works or his/her designee, and this material shall be removed to allow for construction of the new walk. After the sidewalk is constructed, the contractor shall do all patching necessary to form a satisfactory transition ramp from the entrance walk or driveway to the new sidewalk. 
h.  Curing and protection. Curing and protection shall be as follows: 
1.  The newly placed concrete shall be cured by the impervious coating method. As soon after finishing operations as the free water has disappeared, the concrete surface shall be sealed by spraying on it a uniform coating of curing material or an application of AK-2 sealer. The curing material shall be applied in such manner to provide a continuous water-impermeable film on the entire concrete surface. A mixture of 50 percent linseed oil and 50 percent fuel oil may be applied in place of curing material or AK-2 sealer 30 days after the concrete was poured. The new concrete must be clean and free of debris prior to this application. This will not be applied to a damp or wet surface.

Repairs shall be made as follows: 
(1)  Gravel surface. The contractor shall complete the compacted backfill to an elevation 15 inches below the finished street grade and shall immediately place 15 inches of compacted gravel surface course equal in quality to that which is existing and leveled prior to being opened to traffic. If settlement occurs within the excavated area, it will be the contractor's responsibility to maintain this area through the winter months. The director of public works or his/her designee may notify the contractor at any time that maintenance repairs are needed. All work done will be at the contractor's expense. 
(2)  Asphalt, sealcoat, concrete. Asphalt, sealcoat and concrete shall be placed as follows:

(k)  Settlement of work performed. Settlement of the street surfacing, curb and gutter, sidewalks, drive approaches or boulevards, regardless of who installed them, within two years from the date of trench backfilling shall be construed as evidence of poor compaction, and the contractor who backfilled the trench and the surety shall be responsible for the cost of the replacement of the street surfacing, curb and gutter, sidewalks, drive approaches or boulevards. If, after both the contractor and the surety have been given notification by the city, the contractor fails to recompact the backfill and replace the inferior work, the city shall perform the work and bill the contractor or the surety for the actual cost thereof, plus liquidated damages of $100.00. Each successive replacement by the contractor shall be subject to satisfactory performance for a period of two years. 
(l)  Compaction control test. The permittee shall perform compaction control tests at such frequency and such depths as the director of public works deems necessary to verify compliance with the compaction requirements. The contractor shall furnish such materials, labor and equipment deemed necessary by the director of public works in order to obtain the necessary compaction test soil samples. 
(m)  Repair by city. The city may elect to make the pavement repair for any street or sidewalk opening, in which case the cost of making such repair and of maintaining it for two years shall be charged to the person making the street opening. If such charges are not paid within 90 days of actual notice of the charges having been furnished the applicant and owner of the premises for which such permit was issued, it shall become a lien against such premises and thereafter be assessed and collected as a special tax. 
(n)  Denial of permits. If any contractor fails to fulfill the requirements of this article, his/her performance shall be considered by the public works committee before further right-of-way work permits are granted. If his/her record indicates substantial disregard of this article, either willful or otherwise, right-of-way work permits may be denied.

Sec. 34-77. - Location, design and construction requirements. 
(a)  General requirements. The location, design and construction of driveways shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  General design. Private driveways shall be of such width and so located that all of such driveways and their appurtenances are within the limits of the frontage abutting the street of the property served. Driveways shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street intersection area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the street right-of-way required for effective traffic control or for street signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it shall have adequate sight distance along the street. Driveway approaches shall be at least ten feet apart except by special permission from the director of public works, and driveways shall in all cases be placed wherever possible as not to interfere with utilities in place. The permittee or contractor may break off the back of any existing curb and gutter in the area of a proposed driveway or in the area of a driveway opening for a newly constructed house or building. Before the final installation of gravel, granite, blacktop or concrete for the new driveway, the existing and damaged curb and gutter will be replaced with new according to the city's detailed sections for curb and gutter installation at driveway approaches. If this is violated, the city will fine the property owner $1,000.00, and hire a contractor to install the new curb and gutter with the proper approach, all at the expense of the property owner. 
(2)  Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property fronting on a street shall be one, except where deemed necessary and feasible by the plan commission for reasonable and adequate service to the property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the street. 
(3)  Island area. The island area in the street right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way shall constitute a restricted area and may be filled in and graded only as provided in subsection (a)(6) of this section. 
(4)  Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with street cross sections shall slope downward and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage flowing onto the street roadbed. No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the back of the curb or to the edge of the existing road surface, and under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend into the gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be so constructed that they shall not interfere with the drainage of streets, side ditches or roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way. 
(5)  Reconstruction of sidewalks and curb and gutter. When the construction of a driveway requires the removal of curb and gutter, the property owner will pay for the required replacement. The newly proposed driveway surface (blacktop or concrete) will be installed up to the edge of the existing street pavement and to the back of the existing sidewalk only where sidewalks exist on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. If the city street is in gravel, the new driveway surface will be installed up to the gravel shoulder only. Culverts in these areas will be installed as needed. The driveway construction shall include the replacement of any sections of sidewalk that may be damaged or inadequate to support vehicular traffic. This sidewalk area shall be inspected for possible condemnation, subject to total replacement by the director of public works or his/her designee prior to the start of this type of excavation. Sidewalks in the existing driveway and in the proposed new driveway area will remain as sidewalk, not driveway. Standard thickness of residential driveway approaches will be six inches. 
(6)  Defining driveway approaches. 
a.  Where sidewalks exist, the area between the existing sidewalk and the back of the curb is defined as driveway approach. 
b.  Where sidewalks do not exist, the area from the back of the curb to the property line or right-of-way, or where no curb exists, the area from the edge of the street pavement to the property line. 
(7)  Wire mesh installed. In areas where sidewalks do not exist and where a concrete driveway is proposed for installation, "wire mesh" can be installed throughout the entire concrete driveway pour. 
(8)  Restricted areas. The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in and graded only when there is compliance with the following: 
a.  The filling or draining shall be to grades approved by the director of public works and, except where highway drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the street roadbed in a suitable manner. 
b.  Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same size and of equivalent acceptable material as the culvert under the driveway. Intermediate manholes adequate for cleanout purposes may be required where the total culvert length is excessive. 
c.  Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the street roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the street roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts as may be required by the director of public works. 
(9)  Relocation of utilities. Any costs of relocating utilities shall be the responsibility of the property owner with approval of the director of public works necessary before any utility may be relocated and the driveway installed. 
(10)  Construction across sidewalks. All driveway entrances and approaches which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in section 34-40, insofar as such requirements are applicable, including thickness requirements. 
(11)  Variances. Any of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section may be varied by the common council when the peculiar nature of the property or the design of the street may make the rigid adherence to the requirements impossible or impractical. 
(b)  Special requirements for commercial and industrial driveways. The following are applicable to driveways serving commercial or industrial establishments: 
(1)  Width of drive. The maximum permitted width of a commercial or industrial driveway approach shall be no greater than 30 feet in width where the driveway approach crosses the sidewalk or sidewalk area, nor which has a curb opening of more than 30 feet at the outer edge of the sidewalk or sidewalk area except as increased by permissible radii. When the unique nature of the commercial or industrial activity or the physical characteristics of the land would require a driveway of greater width than specified in this subsection, the director of public works in his/her discretion may permit a driveway of additional width. 
(2)  Angular placement. The angle between the centerline of the driveway and the curbline shall not be less than 45 degrees. 
(3)  Island areas. Where the public sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, an island of a minimum length of six feet measured along the curbline shall be placed between each entrance to a city street. The curb shall be left intact for the length of this island. Where the public sidewalk is remote from the curb, an island of a minimum length of ten feet measured along the right-of-way line shall be maintained along each entrance to the city street. All flares shall be tangent to the curbline. A curb length of not less than three feet shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each property line to serve as an island area if an adjoining property owner applies for a driveway permit to serve his/her property. 
(4)  Exception. Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to driveways existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived except for reconstruction of the driveway. 
(c)  Special requirements for residential driveways. The following are applicable to driveways serving residential property: 
(1)  Width. Unless special permission is first received from the plan commission, a residential single-type driveway shall be no greater than 30 feet in width where the driveway crosses the sidewalk or sidewalk area, nor which has a curb opening of more than 30 feet at the outer edge of the sidewalk or sidewalk area. Residential double-type driveways shall be no greater than 30 feet wide at the curbline and 30 feet wide at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk. 
(2)  Angular placement. The centerline of the drive may be parallel to the property line of the lot where access is required or at right angles to the curbline. 
(3)  Exception. This section shall not apply to driveways existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, except for reconstruction of the driveway. 
(d)  Appeal from permit refusal. Any person feeling himself/herself aggrieved by the refusal of the director of public works to issue a permit for a private driveway may appeal such refusal to the board of appeals within 20 days after such refusal to issue such permit is made. 
(e)  Prohibited driveways. The following driveways are prohibited: 
(1)  No person shall place, construct, locate or cause to be placed, constructed or located any obstruction or structure within the limits of any public road, highway or street in the city except as permitted by this section. As used in this subsection (e)(1), the term "structure" includes private driveways, a portion of which extends into any public road, highway or street, and which is in nonconformance with this article. 
(2)  No driveway shall be closer than 35 feet to the extended street line at an intersection. At street intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the street intersection area and shall not occupy areas of the roadway deemed necessary by the city for effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals. 
(3)  The grade of that portion of any private driveway or pedestrian path located within the limits of any public road, highway or street shall be such as shall meet the grade of the existing public roadway at its edge and not cause an obstruction to the maintenance or clearing of such public roadway. 
(4)  No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the facing of the curb, and under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend into any gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be constructed as not to interfere with the drainage of streets, side ditches or roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way. 
(5)  No portion of any curb, parapet or retaining wall, rising above the grade of the driveway, erected by the owner of the premises involved shall extend beyond the culvert spanning the watercourse located in such public way. 
(f)  Culvert construction standards. Culvert construction standards are as follows: 
(1)  Size. Culverts, when required by the director of public works, shall be installed prior to construction work being commenced on the property served. No pipe smaller than 12 inches in diameter or equivalent elliptical or arch pipe will be allowed. All culverts shall be constructed of galvanized steel or reinforced concrete and shall be of new manufacture, unless specifically excepted by the director of public works. 
(2)  Gauge. The minimum wall thickness for the galvanized steel pipe culverts shall be in accordance with the following:

Sec. 42-134. - Well head protection. 
(a)  Statement of purpose and authority. The residents of the city depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of the well head protection ordinance is to institute land use regulations and restrictions to protect the city of Antigo's municipal water supply and well fields, and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the city. 
    Statutory authority of the city to enact these regulations was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act 410 (effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater protection to the statutory authorization for municipal planning and zoning to protect public health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 1624 § 1, 1997) 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms are defined in this subsection: 
Agricultural uses means and includes pesticide and/or fertilizer storage and use, septage and/or sludge spreading, animal waste land spreading, animal waste facilities and animal confinement facilities related to the production of crops and use of livestock for commercial purposes. 
Aquifer means a saturated, permeable geologic formation that contains and will yield significant quantities of water. 
Cone of depression means the area under which the water level in an aquifer is lowered by the pumping of a well. 
Facility means something created, built, installed or established to serve a particular purpose. 
Five-year time of travel (TOT) means the area up gradient of a pumping well from the outer boundary of which it is determined or estimated that groundwater and potential contaminants will take five years to reach the pumping well. 
Groundwater divide means ridge in the water table, or potentiometric surface of an aquifer, from which groundwater moves away in both directions. The line of highest hydraulic head in the water table or potentiometric surface.

Sec. 42-135. - Water line flushing for privately-owned systems. 
    The common council of the city does ordain as follows: 
(1)  The city water department must be given a minimum of 48 hours notice before any activity such as line flushing, valve exercising, or hydrant flushing is to be conducted by non-department personnel on a private system. The department will issue a permit designating the authorized times and dates during which the maintenance activity can be conducted. 
(2)  All water being flushed must be accounted for either by direct measurement, or at a minimum of a timed flush from an identified hydrant location. The city will calculate the volume based on orifice size, pressure, and time. Under public service commission rules all water must be accounted for. 
(3)  In winter or periods of freezing all flush water must be discharged to a storm drain capable of handling the flow to avoid situations of water being discharged on to a street, freezing and leading to accidents. Additionally, the hydrants must be properly winterized and then inspected by water department personnel before the contractor leaves the site. Such inspection must be signed off on the permit by a designated water department employee. 
(4)  Failure to comply with this policy will result in a fine of $1,000.00 against the owner of a private system found in non-compliance.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 

Sec. 42-281. - Findings and declarations of policy. 
    The City of Antigo finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the City of Antigo, is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses, and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other things, increasing infiltration to the sanitary sewer. In addition, surface water runoff causes erosion of lands, damages to businesses and residences, sedimentation, and other environmental damage in the City of Antigo and/or surrounding area. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the City of Antigo is exercising its authority to establish a stormwater utility for stormwater management services. The city is acting under the authority of Wis. Stats. §§ 62.04, 62.11, 62.16, 62.175, 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0627, 66.0809, 66.0811 and 66.0821. 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 1, 12-9-2009) 
Sec. 42-282. - Establishment. 
    The director of the stormwater utility shall be the director of administrative services, herein after referred to as "director". 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 2, 12-9-2009) 
Sec. 42-283. - Authority. 
    The city, acting through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance such facilities, operations and activities, as are deemed by the city, to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation due to enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls, ponds, streets, roads, ditches and such other facilities as will support a stormwater management system. 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 3, 12-9-2009)

(Ord. No. 1205B, § 6, 12-9-2009) 
Sec. 42-287. - Basis of charge. 
    By this article, the city council is establishing the rate classification and basis for computation of charge for stormwater services for each lot and parcel within the City of Antigo. The actual charges to be imposed pursuant to these rate classifications, and any future changes in those rates, shall be made by resolution. A schedule of current rates, following approval by the city council shall be maintained and on file in the office of the city clerk. All charges established pursuant to this article shall be fair and reasonable. Stormwater utility charges shall be based on the number of equivalent runoff units (ERUs) assigned to the parcel. The ERU charge shall be assessed based upon the impervious area as reasonably determined by the civil technologist/surveyor, except for undeveloped properties, which shall be exempt from the stormwater utility charge. 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 7, 12-9-2009) 
Sec. 42-288. - Customer classification. 
(a)  Customer classes. For the purposes of imposing the stormwater charges, all lots and parcels within the city area classified into the following six customer classes:

Sec. 42-289. - Charge formulas. 
(a)  Residential-Single-family. The charges imposed for single-family residential properties shall be the fee for one ERU. 
(b)  Residential-Two or more living units. The charges imposed for residential properties with two or more living units shall be 0.50 of one ERU per living unit existing on the property, i.e.: 
Multifamily parcel charge = 0.5 × ERU fee × number of dwelling units 
(c)  Nonresidential. The charges imposed for contiguous nonresidential properties held by a common owner shall be the fee for one ERU, multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total square footage of impervious area of the property by the square footage of one ERU. The factor shall be rounded down to the nearest one-tenth, i.e.: 
Nonresidential parcel charge = ERU fee × parcel impervious area ÷ 3,069 ft. 2 
(d)  Nonresidential/residential mixed. The charges imposed for nonresidential/residential mixed properties shall be the greater of the following proportional basis: 
Multifamily parcel charge = 0.5 × ERU fee × number of dwelling units 
Or 
Nonresidential parcel charge = ERU fee × parcel impervious area ÷ 3,069 ft. 2 less the equivalent of one parking space per unit in the parking area. 
(e)  Undeveloped. There shall be no charges imposed on parcels during the time period in which they are defined herein as undeveloped. 
(f)  Right-of-way. Public highway, road and rail right-of-way shall be exempt from the stormwater utility fee. 
(g)  Minimum charge. The minimum charges for any customer charged a fee shall be equal to the fee for one-half of one ERU, in the absence of a credit or adjustment approved by the director. 
(h)  Impervious area measurement. The civil technologist/surveyor shall be responsible for determining the impervious area of nonresidential parcels based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the city assessor, director of administrative services, aerial photography, property owner, tenant or developer. The director may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. The number of ERUs shall be updated by the civil technologist/surveyor based on any additions to the impervious area as approved through the building permit process. 
    Upon approval of a building permit, or curb cut permit for any new construction, addition, or other development of new impervious areas including parking areas, driveways, patios, etc., the building inspector, assessor or street commissioner shall notify the civil technologist/surveyor of such. The civil technologist/surveyor shall measure and calculate any increase or decrease in impervious area that may result in a change in the number of ERUs assigned to the parcel. The civil technologist/surveyor shall recalculate the number of ERUs and furnish it to clerk. The clerk shall insure that the updated number of ERUs is applied to the appropriate account. 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 9, 12-9-2009; Ord. No. 1210B, §§ 2-5, 4-14-2010) 
Sec. 42-290. - Fees. 
    The city council shall, by resolution, set or adjust the ERU fee to reflect the costs of the stormwater management program. Stormwater fees will be kept on file with the city clerk.

Sec. 42-291. - Credits and adjustments. 
    The city council shall adopt, by separate resolution, criteria recommended by the director for providing credits and adjustments. The director shall develop a manual that explains the criteria for calculating credits and adjustments and provides application materials for each. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to prove, using the credits and adjustments manual, that a parcel is eligible for either a credit or an adjustment. 
(1)  Credits. 
a.  Eligibility. Customer may be eligible for a credit, in the form of a reduced ERU multiplier for properties where all of the following conditions apply: 
1.  The city's cost of providing service or making service available to the property has been lessened. 
2.  The property conforms to all applicable ordinances and standards of the City of Antigo in effect at the time of parcel development. 
3.  The property has been assigned a nonresidential user classification by the director. 
b.  Maximum credit. The maximum aggregate credit for any individual property is 50 percent of its ERU charge, regardless of how many types of credits the property qualifies for. 
c.  Credit types. The following credits may be available to customers for properties that meet all of the eligibility criteria of subsection a.: 
1.  Peak flow control credit. Credits shall be considered for customers who own and maintain stormwater management facilities such as retention or detention basins that exceed the city's peak discharge rate requirements as set forth in article VII of the City of Antigo's Land Use Regulations, Construction Site Erosion and Stormwater Runoff, subsection 14-14-1611(f)(2). 
2.  Direct discharge credit. Credits shall be considered for properties that discharge all stormwater runoff directly out of the city, without flowing through any storm infrastructure, or any waterway or waterbody maintained in any way by the City of Antigo. 
3.  Other. Other proposals may be considered on a case-by-case basis. All such proposals must either directly reduce the city's cost of managing stormwater runoff. Such proposals may receive up to ten percent credit, towards the 50 percent maximum. 
(2)  Adjustments. A customer may be eligible to have the number of ERUs assigned to their property adjusted under the conditions described below: 
a.  Within 60 days of the submission of a request to the director for an adjustment to the number of ERUs allocated to the property, the director shall issue a written recommendation as to whether the request for adjustment should be granted, denied or granted in part. The written recommendation shall also set forth the reason or reasons for such recommendation. The recommendation shall be sent to the customer by certified mail, and shall be provided to the public works committee. Within 30 days of receipt of the written recommendation from the director, the public works committee shall review the recommendation. The customer shall be notified of the review by certified mail. 
b.  Upon review, the public works committee shall determine whether the recommendation should be approved, rejected or modified. The customer shall be allowed to present evidence at the hearing. The final determination of the public works committee shall be in writing and set forth, in detail, the reason or reasons for its decision and shall inform the customer by certified mail. 
c.  In reviewing a recommendation, the committee shall apply the considerations set forth in Wis. Stats. § 66.0821(4)(c). 
(3)  Effective date. Any ERU adjustment or reduced multiplier granted shall thereafter be used to calculate the customer's user charges. The reduction shall only apply for the period of time subsequent to the filing of the request for adjustment. There shall be no retroactive adjustment for user charges imposed prior to the filing of the request. 
(Ord. No. 1205B, § 11, 12-9-2009) 
Sec. 42-292. - Budget-Excess revenues. 
(a)  The city shall separately account for the stormwater utility finances. The director shall prepare an annual budget, which is to include all operation and maintenance costs, costs of borrowing and other costs related to the operation of the utility. The budget is subject to approval by the city council. Any excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be deposited in a stormwater maintenance fund, which will be used to defer the costs of capital improvements or to retire debt. 
(b)  Bills. Stormwater utility charges shall be billed to the owner of each property. The property owner shall be responsible for payment of the stormwater utility charge. 
(c)  Late payment. Failure to pay the charges when due will result in a one-time late payment fee of three percent, with a $0.50 minimum, that will be added to bills not paid within 20 days of issuance. 
(d)  Unpaid charges. Unpaid charges shall be assessed as a lien against the property pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0821.
