PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of De Pere, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David G. Poucher, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Judith Schmidt-Lehman, City Attorney and Mr. David Minten, Clerk-Treasurer for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    WHEREAS, the Common Council having previously authorized the preparation of a revised Code of the General Ordinances of the City of De Pere, which code was prepared by the Municipal Code Corporation, and a copy of which having been on file in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer for more than two weeks next preceding consideration hereof; 
    NOW, THEREFORE, the Common Council of the City of De Pere, Wisconsin, do ordain as follows: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "De Pere Municipal Code," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 150, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature, excepting Chapter 14, Zoning, (incorporated as Appendix A to the revised Code of Ordinances), enacted on or before December 31, 2000, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished subject to a forfeiture of not less than $1.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each offense, except as provided in the following subsection. 
(2)  Second Offense. In any case where any ordinance or any section or chapter of the Code shall not provide a greater penalty for a second or subsequent conviction for a violation thereof, any person violating the same who shall previously have been convicted of a violation thereof shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $10.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each offense, except that where the penalty provided by any such ordinance or section or chapter of the Code for a first violation thereof shall be larger than the penalty herein provided, such larger penalty shall be applicable. 
Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. Ordinances adopted after December 31, 2000 that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section 7. All other ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed. 
    Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and publication according to law.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein are Charter ordinances amending the Charter of the City of De Pere, Wisconsin, as adopted by the city council. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes have been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Sec. 8-18.2. - Sexual offender loitering restrictions. 
(a)  Findings and intent. 
(1)  This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the City of De Pere from the risk that sexual offenders convicted of an offense against a child may reoffend in locations close to where children congregate. Reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places. Therefore, the city finds and declares that sexual offenders are a serious threat to the public safety of children if regulatory measures are not in place that prohibit their presence in specified areas designated as places children commonly congregate. The City of De Pere finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers, children congregate or play at child-oriented facilities, such as parks and playgrounds and other facilities. 
(2)  It is not the intent of this section to impose a criminal penalty, but rather to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the children of the city by prohibiting convicted sexual offenders from loitering or being present in specified areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers. It is the further intent of this section to recognize that convicted sexual offenders must reenter the community, and the City of De Pere hereby accepts that it has a responsibility to convicted sexual offenders and the surrounding area municipalities to ensure that, in addition to promoting regulatory measures aimed at protecting children, its regulatory measures are not aimed at prohibiting convicted sexual offenders from being part of this society.

Sec. 8-23. - Social host alcohol regulations. 
(a)  Purpose and findings. The common council of the City of De Pere finds: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption works to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as addictions, alcohol overdose, or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. There are also times when a parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some circumstances, provide the alcohol. 
(5)  Holding persons responsible for hosting events or gatherings where underage possession or consumption occurs will provide a deterrent effect toward others contemplating doing so. 
    The City of De Pere therefore intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol responsible for municipal forfeiture(s) regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied any alcohol.

Among the totality of circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted include the following: the person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer; the person refuses to identify himself/herself; the person manifestly endeavors to conceal himself/herself or any object; or such other articulable fact which leads the law enforcement officer to have reasonable suspicion that alarm is warranted. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to the issuance of a municipal citation under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting said person to identify himself/herself and explain said person's presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the preceding sentence or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if believed by the law enforcement officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. 
(b)  Any person who violates this section shall be subject to such forfeiture as provided by the resolution of the common council.

This subsection does not apply to members of the common council. 
(f)  Access procedures. 
(1)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37.

A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(2)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize the officer's request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(3)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in subsection (f) of this section. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(g)  Limitations upon access and withholding. 
(1)  Application of other laws. Any record which is specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law is exempt from disclosure under subsection (d) of this section, except that any portion of that record which contains public information is open to public inspection as provided in subsection (f)(6) of this section. 
(2)  Law enforcement records. Except as otherwise provided by law, whenever federal law or regulations require or as a condition to receipt of aids by the state require that any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes be withheld from public access, then that information is exempt from disclosure under subsection (d) of this section. 
(3)  Contractor's records. Each authority shall make available for inspection and copying under subsection (d) of this section any record produced or collected under a contract entered into by the authority with a person other than an authority to the same extent as if the record were maintained by the authority. This subsection does not apply to the inspection or copying of a record under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(am). 
(4)  Computer programs and data . A computer program, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 16.971(4)(c), is not subject to examination or copying under subsection (d) of this section, but the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to the right of examination and copying, except as otherwise provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35 or this section. 
(5)  Trade secrets. 
i.  The legal custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where it is determined that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest; and 
ii.  An authority may withhold access to any record or portion of a record containing information qualifying as a trade secret as defined in Wis. Stats. § 134.90(1)(c). 
(6)  Separation of information. If a record contains information that is subject to disclosure under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(a) or (am) and information that is not subject to such disclosure, the authority having custody of the record shall provide the information that is subject to disclosure and delete the information that is not subject to disclosure from the record before release. 
(7)  Identities of applicants for public positions. 
a.  In this section, the term "final candidate" means each applicant for a position who is seriously considered for appointment or whose name is certified for appointment and whose name is submitted for final consideration to an authority for appointment to any local public office, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.42(7w). The term "final candidate" includes whenever there are at least five candidates for an office or position, each of the five candidates who are considered most qualified for the office or position by an authority, and whenever there are less than five candidates for an office or position, each such candidate. Whenever an appointment is to be made from a group of more than five candidates, the term "final candidate" also includes each candidate in the group. 
b.  Every applicant for a position with any authority may indicate in writing to the authority that the applicant does not wish the authority to reveal the officer's identity. Except with respect to an applicant whose name is certified as a final candidate, if an applicant makes such an indication in writing, the authority shall not provide access to any record related to the application that may reveal the identity of the applicant. 
(8)  Identities of law enforcement informants. 
a.  In this subsection: 
1.  The term "informant" means an individual who requests confidentiality from a law enforcement agency in conjunction with providing information to that agency or, pursuant to an express promise of confidentiality by a law enforcement agency or under circumstances in which a promise of confidentiality would reasonably be implied, provides information to a law enforcement agency or, is working with a law enforcement agency to obtain information, related in any case to any of the following: 
i.  Another person who the individual or the law enforcement agency suspects has violated, is violating or will violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
ii.  Past, present or future activities that the individual or law enforcement agency believes may violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
2.  The term "law enforcement agency" has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 165.83(1)(b), and includes the department of corrections. 
b.  If an authority that is a law enforcement agency receives a request to inspect or copy a record or portion of a record under subsection (d) of this section that contains specific information including, but not limited to, a name, address, telephone number, voice recording or handwriting sample which, if disclosed, would identify an informant, the authority shall delete the portion of the record in which the information is contained or, if not portion of the record can be inspected or copied without identifying the informant, shall withhold the record unless the legal custodian of the record, designated under Wis. Stats. § 19.33, makes a determination, at the time that the request is made, that the public interest in allowing a person to inspect, copy or receive a copy of such identifying information outweighs the harm done to the public interest by providing such access. 
(9)  Records of plans or specifications for state buildings. Records containing plans or specifications for any state-owned or state-leased building, structure of facility or any proposed state-owned or state-leased building, structure or facility are not subject to the right of inspection or copying under subsection (d) of this section except as the department of administration otherwise provides by rule. 
(10)  Public library circulation records exempt. As provided by Wis. Stats. § 3.30, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section. 
(11)  Refusal of requests not specifically exempt from disclosure. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if it is determined that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
b.  Records of current deliberations after a quasijudicial hearing. 
c.  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline, or any city officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a city officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure.

e.  Records or current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of city property, investing of city fund, or other city business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.

g.  Communications between legal counsel for the city and any officer, agent or employee of the city, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the city or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(12)  Property assessment income and expense information. Whenever the assessor, in the performance of the officer's duties, requests and obtains income and expense information pursuant to the Wis. Stats. § 70.47(7)(af) or any successor statute thereto, then such income and expense information that is provided to the assessor shall, except as provided below, be held by the assessor on a confidential basis.

In addition to any other method allowed under state law, the costs of public construction of water distribution facilities and appurtenances, sanitary sewers and appurtenances, storm sewers and appurtenances, streets including sidewalks constructed or reconstructed as a part of street improvements and related landscaping and amenities may be charged in whole or in part to the property benefited thereby in accordance with the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 66.0701 and § 66.0703 and as provided in this section. The establishment of special assessments for the aforementioned improvements represents an exercise of the police power of the City of De Pere. 
(a)  Public improvements assessment overview. 
(1)  Non-assessable improvements. Non-assessable improvements are public infrastructure, street construction and sidewalk construction improvements abutting parcels, other than corner lot parcels, where such improvements already exist, including: 
a.  Street reconstruction of existing asphalt and concrete streets, including construction from a rural to an urban roadway with new curb and gutter and including additional lanes of travel. 
b.  Utility reconstruction. 
c.  Asphalt or concrete street resurfacing. 
d.  Stormwater management facilities that are not required for an existing developed parcel, but rather constructed to meet the overall city requirements for regulatory permitting. 
e.  Sidewalk replaced due to grade change, utility replacement, and/or damage by trees in city right-of-way. 
f.  Street light additions to existing streets. 
g.  New construction of arterial street improvements where access to the arterial street from such parcel is prohibited. "Arterial street" for purposes of this section means principal and minor arterial roads as classified by the Brown County Planning Commission and included in the Green Bay Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) Long-Range Transportation Plan at the time such road is constructed. 
(2)  Assessable improvements. Assessable improvements are public infrastructure, street construction and sidewalk construction improvements which confer special upon abutting property. Public infrastructure includes water, storm sewer and sanitary sewer but does not include sewer capacity charges from a metropolitan sewerage district. Assessable improvements include: 
a.  New infrastructure construction to a new development (new streets, storm, sanitary, water et al). 
b.  New utility construction to an existing and/or developed parcel such as water main, sanitary sewer, or storm sewer. 
c.  New or additional laterals to an existing lot. 
d.  Stormwater management facilities that provide a benefit to a new or existing parcel to be redeveloped, eliminating the requirement for on-site treatment. 
e.  Driveway aprons for new projects and replacement of gravel drives to the city standard. 
f.  New construction of sidewalk. 
g.  Street lights for new street construction. 
h.  Public improvements installed along multi-jurisdictional rights-of-way or property abutting two or more municipal jurisdictions will be assessed to all benefitting properties, with assessments collected by the city upon annexation or intergovernmental agreement. 
(3)  Assessment methodologies. 
a.  Front foot method. When this method is used, benefit is determined to be proportional to the front footage of the property as follows: 
i.  Assessable footages for improvement will be the linear foot as measured along the building setback line extended to intersect with the property line. When determining assessable footage, all property adjacent to and benefited by the improvement will be assessed. This includes all publically owned property. Improvements constructed within the intersection will be assessed to the benefited properties. 
ii.  On corner lots that have or will have new infrastructure in each street adjacent to the property for the entire length of each side, a reduction of one-third the combined total lot footage, as measured along the building setback line is made up to a maximum of 60 feet. On corner lots that will have new infrastructure on only one street, assessable footage is measured along the building setback line on the side where the utility is installed with no reduction made. 
iii.  In the event that new infrastructure is constructed on the front and back of a property, and there is no ability to split the property, the property will be assessed at the footage along the building setback line on the side of lot where the property is connected to the new infrastructure. 
iv.  When new utility construction associated with new development is constructed along a property line common to adjacent interior lots, the assessable footage will be measured as a standard interior lot having a utility constructed in the street disregarding the fact it may have a utility on two sides of the lot. 
b.  Lot or connection method. The lot or connection method allocates costs and special assessments on the assumption that every lot or every connection to the public facilities received the same benefit regardless of the difference in the size or shape of the lot. The use of this neighborhood and there exists some uniformity as to the types of uses on the property. 
c.  Regional method. The regional method allocates cost for improvements to benefitting properties based on area or flow. In the case of improvements such as interceptor sewer costs (including those from the Green Bay Metropolitan Sewerage District), lift stations and force mains, water towers, and regional storm water management facilities, benefits would be normally more closely associated with an area or a calculated flow generation. 
The use of this method will require establishment of a per unit cost for the specific improvement, which will the net developable area or calculated flow rate for areas receiving the improvement. 
d.  Square foot method. The square foot method allocates costs based on the square foot of an improvement that a property receives. Costs are determined based on the actual cost to provide the benefit. This method is generally used for driveway and sidewalk improvements. 
e.  Combination methods. A combination of methods may be required for a specific project in particular, on new development. For new contiguous development, improvement costs are paid by the developer. All assessable costs are generally calculated on a per lot basis. For new, non-contiguous development, improvement costs are calculated on a combination of front foot and per lot basis as follows: 
i.  Costs for utility extensions to service the development are calculated on a per front foot basis. All properties that benefit from the installation of the new utility will be assessed on a linear foot basis as determined by the engineer. Properties that do not benefit from the new utility will not be assessed. If the new utility is installed for the need of the new development, the developer will be responsible for all non-benefitting utility costs. 
ii.  Costs for improvements internal to the new development are generally calculated on a per lot basis. The costs for utilities at non-benefitting properties will be generally included in the per lot basis. 
(b)  New development extension of public infrastructure. 
(1)  Special assessment. The owner of property requesting extension of municipal infrastructure improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, stormwater management, and grading, graveling and paving of streets) may be specially assessed for said improvements pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0703. 
(2)  Letter of credit. The owner of property requesting extension of municipal infrastructure improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, stormwater management, and grading, graveling and paving of streets) may be required to file an irrevocable letter of credit or cash with the city clerk prior to the city publicly bidding such work. The terms and conditions of such letter of credit and the work to be bid by city for construction shall be as provided in a developer's public infrastructure agreement. 
(3)  Residential infrastructure development agreement. The owner of property requesting extension of municipal infrastructure improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, stormwater management, and grading, graveling and paving of streets) may be permitted to enter into a residential infrastructure development agreement with the city as authorized under common council Resolution 10-131, a copy of which is available in the office of the city clerk. 
(c)  New infrastructure in existing development. Except as provided in subsection (c) below, the owner of property abutting the extension of municipal infrastructure improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, stormwater management, and grading, graveling and paving of streets) may be specially assessed for said improvements pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0703. 
(d)  New storm sewer main or lateral installation in existing urban development. This subsection shall be applicable only to installations in existing urban development. Existing urban development shall mean any existing street with curb and gutter. 
(1)  Concurrent with street reconstruction or resurfacing project. Storm sewer main and laterals shall be constructed in conjunction with street reconstruction or resurfacing projects when requested by a property owner abutting said improvement project or when recommended by the director of public works to address storm drainage issues in such area. The costs associated with installation of new storm sewer main and/or service lines (laterals) shall be assessed as follows: 
a.  Cost share between the stormwater utility and property owner. 
i.  Storm sewer main. The stormwater utility shall bear 80 percent of the costs associated with the storm sewer main installation. The abutting property owner shall be assessed 20 percent off the costs associated with installation of the storm sewer main. 
A.  For existing residential development up to two units per parcel, the assessment shall be calculated using the average cost over the preceding three-year period of a 12-inch diameter storm sewer main with a lot width of 60 feet at the right-of-way. 
B.  For all other existing development, the assessment shall be calculated using the average cost over the preceding three-year period of an 18-inch diameter storm sewer main multiplied by the linear front foot of the parcel at the right-of-way. 
ii.  Storm sewer lateral. The abutting property owner shall be assessed 100 percent of the costs associated with installation of the storm sewer lateral. 
A.  For existing residential development up to two units per parcel, the assessment shall be calculated using the average cost over the preceding three-year period of a six-inch diameter storm lateral with a lot width of 60 feet at the right-of-way. 
B.  For all other existing development, the assessment shall be calculated using the average cost over the preceding three-year period of a six-inch, eight-inch or 12-inch diameter storm sewer lateral as determined by the development on the parcel, with a lot width at the right-of-way of 70 lineal feet. 
b.  Method and basis of assessment. 
i.  Basis of assessment. The board of public works shall yearly determine the cost of storm sewer main and storm sewer lateral installation using the previous year's actual construction costs for such improvements. Whenever the actual costs shall be found to vary materially from the year prior, the board shall consider whether to reconsider and reopen any assessment and it may, after giving the same notice and having a public hearing as provided in subsection d. below, may cancel, amend or conform the assessment. 
ii.  Method of assessment. Properties abutting the improvements shall be assessed on a per lot basis.

If the cost of the project shall be less than the special assessment levied, the board, without notice or hearing, shall reduce each special assessment proportionately and where any assessments have been paid, and the excess over cost shall be refunded to the property owner. 
(2)  Without concurrent street reconstruction or resurfacing project. Mini-storm sewer (meaning storm sewer main of smaller diameter intended to provide drainage for sump pumps and backyard drains) and laterals shall be installed in residential zoning districts where no street reconstruction or resurfacing improvements are occurring if requested by a property owner to address storm drainage issues or when recommended by the director of public works to address drainage issues in the area.

Such deferment shall be by resolution directing the finance director-treasurer to pay all or any portion of assessments levied or charged against such property. 
(b)  Copy of resolution to be filed with county register of deeds. A copy of such resolution, with a statement of the amount and date paid and a description of the property, certified by the clerk, shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. The amount shall thereby become a lien upon such real property in favor of the city prior to any other lien, than prior outstanding tax certificates or prior liens hereunder, for the amount paid, with legal interest, and shall be enforceable after transfer of title of the property by sale, inheritance, gift or will, in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of mechanics' liens. 
(c)  Discharge of lien.

(1)  The application shall list the relationship, ages and employment status of the applicant and all dependents; a complete schedule setting forth all assets, liabilities and income from all sources, including his or her own and those of his or her dependents; and any other pertinent information which may assist in evaluating such application. The current federal poverty guidelines shall be used by the committee in evaluating the applicant's ability to pay the assessment. Nothing herein shall prohibit an applicant with a household income above such guidelines from receiving a deferral if the committee determines that extraordinary expenses or other financial obligations of the applicant nonetheless constitute/create hardship to the extent the applicant is unable to pay the assessment. 
(2)  The above information, together with the information provided in paragraph (f) below, shall be considered and treated as privileged information and shall not be made public without the applicant's consent. 
(3)  Applications shall be reviewed by the committee which shall either grant or deny the requested deferment. The decision of the committee shall be final. 
(f)  Notification of clerk of increases. The clerk shall annually request from persons granted a deferral, information pertaining to any increase in assets, annual income or change in any factor identified in the committee's hardship determination. If the information provided shows that the household income of the deferral recipient exceeds the federal poverty guidelines, the clerk shall notify the deferral recipient that the basis of hardship has ceased together with notice that the assessment, plus interest, will be placed upon the tax roll as a special charge for services rendered pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. A determination that the basis of hardship has ceased under this paragraph may be appealed to the committee for its review of the hardship determination, which determination on review shall be final. Appeal to the committee shall be in writing and filed with the city clerk within 30 days of the clerk's determination that the basis of hardship has ceased. 
(g)  Failure to provide, providing false or providing incomplete information. If the applicant willfully provides false or incomplete information, or fails to provide the information requested under paragraph (f) above, the basis for hardship shall no longer exist and the assessments shall become due and owing in full. 
(h)  Interest; deferment period. Interest at the rate at which the city most recently bonded, plus one percent shall be charged during the deferment period. The interest rate shall not, however, exceed the legal rate prescribed by state law.

b)  Use of access shall be limited to the use described in the application for the temporary access permit. 
c)  Wherever practical, only one point of access for each two parcels to be located at the common property line of adjoining parcels shall be permitted.

ARTICLE III. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES 

14-16. - Statement of purpose. 
    This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses which affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in the district not be permitted to continue without restrictions. 
    The purpose of this Article III is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses shall be permitted to continue. 
14-17. - Nonconforming uses regulated. 
    Nonconforming uses shall be permitted to continue subject to the following: 
(1)  Continued use. Only that precise regulated land use in existence at the time the use became nonconforming may be continued. No enlargement, extension, movement, addition, change, or substitution of a nonconforming use shall be permitted. 
(2)  Nonconforming use of land. The amount of real property upon which a nonconforming use is carried on shall not be extended beyond the area occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming. 
(3)  Structures on lots containing nonconforming use. A structure on a lot containing a nonconforming use shall not be extended, enlarged, totally rebuilt, substituted, moved, remodeled, modified, or added to where the cost of such change, combined with the cost of any previous change to the structure, exceeds 50% [percent] of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the adoption or amendment which made the structure or use nonconforming or unless the change is required by law or until such nonconforming use has been made to conform with this Chapter [appendix]. 
(4)  Lot containing nonconforming use. No lot containing a nonconforming use may be changed in size, modified as to shape, or change[d] in any other manner, except when such change is required by law or until the nonconforming use is made to comply with the law. 
(5)  Undeveloped nonconforming lot. A nonconforming lot may be developed as long as all uses of the lot are legal conforming uses. Any structure placed on a nonconforming lot shall be in compliance with the established setback lines for the zoning district in which it is located and the yard, height, floor area ratio, parking, loading, and access provisions of this chapter [appendix]. 
(6)  Existing conforming uses on nonconforming lots containing conforming structures. The use of a conforming structure on a nonconforming lot may be continued as long as all uses on the land containing the structure are legal conforming uses. Such conforming structure may be extended, enlarged, substituted, moved, remodeled, modified, or added to as long as any such change conforms with the established building setback lines along streets, and the yard, height, parking, loading, and access provisions of this Chapter [appendix], and may be totally rebuilt if such reconstruction is identical in size and shape and use to the original conforming structure. 
(7)  Legal conforming uses on nonconforming lot or nonconforming lot containing legal nonconforming structure. The legal conforming use of a nonconforming structure may be continued although the structure's size or location does not conform with the established building setback line along streets or yard, height, parking, loading, and/or access provisions of this Chapter [appendix]. 
(8)  Discontinuance. If a legal nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of twelve (12) months, any future use of the structure, land, or water shall conform to the provisions of this Chapter [appendix]. 
14-18. - Nonconforming uses-Administration/burden. 
(1)  Record of nonconforming uses. A record of all nonconforming uses shall be maintained by the Zoning Inspector, listing the owner's name and address, description of all uses of any structures, land, or water, a site plan of the property showing the location of any structures, a plat map showing the dimensions of the lot, and a notation as to the equalized value of the land and any improvements at the time the nonconforming use was created. 
(2)  Nonconforming use/burden of proof. The property owner has the burden of showing that a use, structure, or lot is a conforming use. The initial determination of such nonconforming status shall be made by the Zoning Inspector or Building Inspector, which determination is appealable to the Plan Commission within thirty (30) days of such initial determination.

For the purpose of this paragraph, the R-1 District shall be considered the highest classification and the R-2 District shall be considered the lower classification. 
(b)  Upon recommendation of the Plan Commission to adopt a proposed amendment hereunder, it shall order the City Clerk to schedule a public hearing thereon before the Common Council. The Clerk shall serve, by First Class Mail, a copy of the public hearing notice to all owners of record of real property located within three hundred (300) feet of the property for which a change in zoning classification is sought. 
(6)  Notice of zoning amendment sign. In addition to all other public notices required by law to be made in relation to any amendment to this ordinance or to district boundaries established hereunder, the Plan Commission shall, at the time such amendment is ordered to public hearing, cause an appropriate temporary "zoning notice" sign to be installed or erected on or upon said property in such a manner as to give reasonable notice to the public that said property is being considered for zoning amendment by the Plan Commission. Where application for such amendment comes from a source other than the property owner and permission for installation or erection of such sign upon the property is not granted, the Plan Commission shall direct, where possible, that such sign be erected in a safe manner within publicly owned property adjacent or abutting the parcel of property which is being considered for the zoning amendment. 
(7)  Action by the council. 
(a)  The Council shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this ordinance until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from the Plan Commission on the proposed amendment. 
(b)  (1)  The Common Council may grant or deny any application for an amendment; provided however that in case of a protest against a proposed amendment duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the areas of the land included in such proposed amendment, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the area of the land immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the land directly opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of the members of the council voting on the proposed change. 
(2)  Any protest petition shall be filed with the city clerk no later than noon on the Friday preceding the scheduled vote. 
(c)  If an application for a proposed amendment is not acted upon finally by the common council within 90 days of the public hearing for such amendment, it shall be deemed to have been denied. This paragraph shall not apply in circumstances where the application is referred back to staff or committee after the public hearing is held.

14-30. - Conditional uses. 
(1)  Purpose. It is recognized that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular uses of the particular location. Such conditional uses fall into two categories: 
(a)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; 
(b)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(2)  Application for conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form prescribed therefore. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the Plan Commission and shall include a statement, in writing, by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set forth in Subsection 5 hereinafter. All applications requesting conditional use approval for an overnight shelter facility shall include, in addition to such other information as required by the Plan Commission or Zoning Administrator, information concerning the proposed hours of operation, specific services, if any, to be provided to the shelter users, and specific plans for assistance to the shelter users during the day time hours the shelter facility is closed. Such application shall be forwarded from the Zoning Administrator to the Plan Commission with a request to review said application and accompanying data and submit written recommendations thereon to the City Council. 
(3)  Application for conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Building Inspector on a form prescribed by the Building Inspector. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the Plan Commission and shall include a statement, in writing, by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set forth in Subsection 5 hereinafter. All applications requesting conditional use approval for an overnight shelter facility shall include, in addition to such other information as required by the Plan Commission or Building Inspector, information concerning the proposed hours of operation, specific services, if any, to be provided to the shelter users, and specific plans for assistance to the shelter users during the day time hours the shelter facility is closed. Such application shall be forwarded from the Building Inspector to the Plan Commission with a request to review said application and accompanying data and submit written recommendations thereon to the City Council. 
(4)  Public notice. All owners of property located within three hundred (300) feet of any property proposed for a conditional use shall be forwarded a copy of the Plan Commission agenda prior to the Plan Commission meeting at which the proposed conditional use application is reviewed. 
(5)  Standards. No conditional use shall be recommended by the Plan Commission unless such Commission shall find: 
(a)  That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare; 
(b)  That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the orderly development and improvement in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(c)  That adequate facilities, access roads, drainage, and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
(d)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; and 
(e)  That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Council pursuant to the recommendations of the Plan Commission. 
(6)  Authorization. For each application for a conditional use, the Plan Commission shall report to the Council its findings and recommendations, including the stipulations or additional conditions and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. If an application for a proposed conditional use is not acted upon finally by the Council within sixty (60) days of the date upon which such application is received by the Council, it shall be deemed to have been denied. 
(7)  Hearing on application. Upon receipt in proper form of the written recommendations referred to in subsection c., above, the Council shall hold one public hearing on the proposed conditional use. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published as a Class 1 notice. The Clerk shall serve, by First Class Mail, a copy of the public hearing notice to all owners of record of real property located within three hundred (300) feet of the property for which a conditional use permit is sought. 
(8)  Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the Plan Commission may recommend, and the Council shall stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in subsection 5., above. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the City Council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with. 
(9)  Revocation of a conditional use. Upon the determination by the Zoning Administrator that the time limits cited in Section 14-06(3) or the conditions and stipulations of an approved conditional use have not been complied with, the Zoning Administrator shall send written notice to the party granted the conditional use of the actions necessary to comply with the conditional use permit. The notice shall specify that failure to comply with the required conditions or stipulations within thirty (30) days will invalidate the conditional use permit. Appeals to this determination shall be to the Plan Commission.

14-31. - Fees. 
    All applications for zoning amendment, conditional use, Planned Development District Overlay, right-of-way vacation request, variance requests, street name change, and appeals shall be accompanied by such fee as determined by resolution of the Common Council. Such fees may include late fees, penalties, and fees for expedited process. All fees shall be non-refundable and shall be paid to the Clerk.

However, in the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the regulations herein shall be controlling in the event of a conflict between this ordinance and other local zoning or subdivision regulations. 
(6)  Permitted uses. 
(a)  All uses permitted under the basic zoning regulations applicable to the underlying zoning district in which the particular property is located. 
(b)  Any other uses permitted under Article VI (Residence Districts) or Article VII (Business Districts) subject to the criteria as established in Section 14-59(7) hereof, provided that no use shall be permitted except in conformity with a specific and precise development plan pursuant to the procedural and regulatory provisions hereof. 
(c)  Schools, Parks, and Recreation Facilities. The developer in the formulation of the PDD shall consult and receive the approval of the City as to the reservation of suitable sites of adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainage ways, and other public uses if so designated on the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, or component area development plan, if any, or required by the City. 
(d)  Nonresidential uses limited to those uses specifically approved by the Plan Commission are permitted in a PDD, based on the following criteria: 
1)  Nonresidential development shall be integrated into the total design of the project. 
2)  The areas and type of nonresidential facilities to be allowed in the PDD shall be based on a market analysis if so required by the Plan Commission. The market analysis shall demonstrate that the amount of land proposed is needed and can realistically be supported by the residents of the area. For these purposes, such analysis shall contain the following determination: 
a)  Determination of the trade area of the proposed facilities. 
b)  Determination of the trade area population, present and prospective.

(7)  Design standards. 
(a)  General considerations. 
1)  Adequacy of design. Design standards and requirements outlined in this section will be utilized by the City in determining the adequacy of all plans for proposed planned developments. 
2)  Consideration of comprehensive plan. Consideration shall be given to applicable provisions of the City's Comprehensive Plan as it pertains to future school sites, recreation sites, water supply, and sewage treatment systems, highway and street alignments, environmental integrity, and other public facilities where appropriate. 
3)  Consideration of existing adjacent development. The development of the proposed PDD shall take into consideration relevant features of adjacent existing development. 
4)  Unsafe or hazardous conditions. Land with unsafe or hazardous conditions, such as open quarries, unconsolidated fill, flood plains, or steep slopes, shall not be developed unless the PDD provides for adequate safeguards which are approved by the Plan Commission. 
(b)  Location of structures. Specific lot size, building, location, height size, floor area, and other such requirements shall be based upon determination by the Plan Commission as to their appropriateness to the proposed uses or structures as they relate to the total environmental concept of the planned development, consistent with the criteria set forth in this section, and as near as practicable, consistent with standards established in applicable existing basic zoning districts and regulations, and with those generally accepted basic standards necessary to insure the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the area of the community. 
(c)  Allowable densities. 
1)  In the case of residential uses, the allowable density shall be based upon the following considerations: 
a)  That there will result an appropriate relationship between the number of dwelling units and the facilities required and available to service them, such as sewer, water, schools, streets, and other appropriate municipal services. 
b)  That there will be an appropriate provision of common open space to compensate for clustering or other concentration of dwelling units, consistent with the goal of creating a desirable living environment. Except as provided below, no plan for a planned development shall be approved unless such plan provides for permanent open space equivalent to twenty percent (20%) of the total area in single family residential planned developments, thirty percent (30%) in multiple family planned developments, and five percent (5%) in business planned developments. Such open space may be in any of the following forms, provided they contribute realistically and specifically to the enhancement of the environmental character of the development for benefit of the residents thereof and the community. 
-  Natural areas such as woods, meadows, marshes, lakes, streams, and ponds, providing either an environmental amenity or serving a useful ecological purpose. 
-  Agricultural areas, including crop land, pasture, orchards, and tree nurseries, contributing to the preservation of the agricultural land resource or contributing to the environmental character of the area. 
-  Recreational areas, such as parks, parkways, greenbelts, playfields, and golf courses. 
c)  That there will result an appropriate relationship between the character of developments existing or likely to result from the zoning of property adjacent thereto. 
(d)  Site design standards. 
1)  Natural features. Physical layout and form of all structures shall be designed with regard to the topography and natural features of the site. 
2)  Visual aspects. The overall design shall provide for the appearance of external unity throughout the development. Variations of building elevations and materials used therein shall be encouraged insofar as they reinforce rather than hamper the design harmony. Housing and other facilities near the periphery of the planned development shall be designed so as to be harmonious with neighboring area. 
3)  Landscaping. 
a)  Where natural or existing topographic features contributed to the beauty and utility of a development, consideration shall be given to this preservation. Modification to topography features should only occur where it contributes to good appearance. 
b)  Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture, color, and for its ultimate growth. Further, it is recommended that native materials be employed for their ability to tolerate the prevailing adverse conditions. 
c)  In locations where plant materials will be susceptible to injury by pedestrians and/or motor vehicles, appropriate curbs, tree guards, or other protective devices shall be employed. 
(e)  Street design standards. All streets within the PDD dedicated to the public shall be so indicated on the General Development Plan and shall be constructed in accordance with standards outlined in Chapter 22, De Pere Municipal Code, Subdivisions and Platting Regulations, or as modified below. Standards of design and construction of roadways within the PDD may be modified as is deemed appropriate by the Common Council. Right-of-way widths and street pavement widths may be reduced as deemed appropriate by the Common Council, especially where it is found that the plan for the PDD provided for the separation of motorized traffic, and pedestrian and bicycle circulation patterns. In circumstances where public open space is in close proximity to such proposed development, the Plan Commission may determine that the open space percentage requirement above is not needed to compensate for the clustering or concentrating of dwelling units. In such cases, the required density percentage may be waived or modified and the Park Dedication fee imposed by the Common Council pursuant to subsection 46-5(3) of this Code, which shall become a condition of the approval. 
(f)  Accommodation of pedestrian traffic. 
1)  Applicability. Sidewalks and/or other walkways and bicycle paths shall be provided where necessary for the safety and convenience of pedestrian and cyclist traffic within project boundaries. Special attention shall be given to connections accommodating pedestrian movement between the dwelling units' common open space, recreation facilities, schools, commercial establishments, and parking facilities of areas. 
2)  Design considerations. Walkway widths and surface treatment of all walkways shall be designed with regard to their function and the anticipated manner of usage. The natural features of the area traversed in the walkway system and suitable lighting in scale with the project shall also be considered. Utilization of pedestrian ramps as required by law and necessary to either resolve conflicts with vehicular traffic or facilitate the movement of the elderly and/or children. 
(g)  Parking and loading. 
1)  Required number of parking spaces. Accessible off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required and specified in Article X, Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements. 
2)  Landscaping of parking areas. A parking site shall be planned to provide a desirable transition from the streetscape and to provide for adequate landscaping, pedestrian movement, and parking areas. In keeping with this purpose, the following design standards shall be set forth: 
a)  Parking areas shall be arranged so as to prevent thru traffic to other parking areas. 
b)  Parking areas shall be screened from residential structures, roads, and traffic arteries with hedges, dense planting, earth berms, changes in grade, or walls, except where parking areas are designed as an integral part of the street. 
c)  No more than 15 parking spaces shall be permitted in a continuous row without being interrupted by landscaping unless otherwise approved by the Plan Commission. 
d)  All off-street loading and unloading areas shall be paved and the design thereof approved by the Plan Commission. 
e)  All parking areas shall be adequately lighted. All such lighting shall be so arranged as to direct the light away from adjoining residences. 
f)  All parking areas and off-street loading and unloading areas shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of all surface water without erosion, flooding, and other inconveniences. 
(8)  Criteria for approval. The approval of a planned development proposal shall be within the discretion of the Common Council and shall be based upon determination as to compliance with the following criteria: 
(a)  That the proposed development is consistent with the spirit and intent of these regulations and has been prepared with competent professional advice and guidance and produces significant benefits in terms of improved environmental design sufficient to justify the application of the planned development concept instead of conventional zoning restraints. 
(b)  That the site development plan reflects sensitive consideration of the physical nature of the site with particular concern for conservation of natural features, preservation of open space, and careful shaping of terrain to ensure proper drainage and preservation of natural features wherever appropriate. 
(c)  That the general character and intensity of use of the development produces an attractive environment appropriate to the uses proposed and which is compatible with existing developments in the surrounding area and with general community development plans and policies. 
(d)  That the development can be provided with appropriate municipal services. 
(e)  That proposed design standards provide adequately for practical operation and maintenance based on actual functional need in terms of circulation, parking, emergency services, delivery services, snow plowing, and garbage and refuse collection. 
(f)  That adequate provision has been made to ensure proper maintenance and preservation of "common open space" which has been provided within the development for the recreational and aesthetic enhancement of the development, or to preserve or protect natural environmental or ecological resources. Such provisions may be made by dedication to the public or by retention in private ownership with appropriate covenants. Private ownership may be in common or individual ownership subject to the following: 
1)  The "common open space" shall be protected against future development by conveying to the City and to each property owner within the development intended to be benefitted thereby, as part of the conditions for development plan approval, a perpetual "open space easement" running with the land and over such areas restricting them against any future building development or use, except as is consistent with the use as designated on the approved plan for recreational or aesthetic purposes, or for the preservation of natural environmental or ecologic resources. 
2)  The care and maintenance of such "common open space" shall be ensured by adequate covenants and deed restrictions, running to the City as well as to each property, assuring such maintenance. Where such maintenance is not carried out to the satisfaction of the City, the City shall be authorized to treat such area as a special service district and to provide the necessary maintenance service and to levy the cost thereof as a special tax on all properties within such service area. 
3)  In the case of roadways and other rights-of-way which are not dedicated to the public as part of the conditions for project approval, there shall be granted to the City such easements over the same as may be necessary to enable the City to provide suitable and adequate fire protection, sanitary and storm sewer, water, and other required municipal services to the project area. 
4)  Ownership and tax responsibility of private open space areas and rights-of-way shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City and made part of the condition of the plan. 
5)  Areas established for public use shall be dedicated to the City on preliminary and final subdivision plats consistent with the approved development plan. 
(g)  Any other factors which in the discretion of the Common Council are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the area of the community. 
(9)  Zoning procedure, plan approvals, variations, and implementation. The procedure for zoning to a Planned Development District shall be as required for any other zoning amendment except that a petition for zoning to a Planned Development District may be considered only in conjunction with a General Development Plan as hereinafter defined and shall be subject to the following additional requirements: 
(a)  Pre-application conference. Prior to official submittal of a petition for consideration of a Planned Development District, the petitioner (owner, agent, or proponent) shall meet with the Plan Commission and its technical advisory staff, as may be provided by the Common Council, for a preliminary discussion as to the scope and nature of the proposed development and to consider alternate solutions to the development of a given area. In the event that the scope and nature of the proposed development is disapproved by the Plan Commission, the petitioner may present alternate proposals to the Plan Commission or may appeal such matter to the Common Council. 
(b)  Staged approval. A planned development shall be processed in two stages as follows: 
1)  General development plan. The General Development Plan consists of a general concept plan for the entire area covered by the Planned Development District and shall be submitted concurrently with the petition for zoning to a Planned Development District. Such plan shall be clearly marked "General Development Plan" in bold letters and shall provide the following information in sufficient detail to make possible the evaluation of the criteria for approval as set forth in subsection (8) hereof:

8)  Phasing time schedule. Each Precise Implementation Plan shall be accompanied by a schedule showing the times within which each phase or segment of the Precise Implementation Plan will be completed. Approval of any Precise Implementation Plan by the Common Council shall carry with it approval of the time schedule for completion of each phase or segment thereof, including any changes or amendments imposed by the Common Council. In the event that any portion of such time schedule is not met, the Common Council, upon written request of the developer for an extension of time, delivered to the Common Council at least twenty (20) days prior to the expiration of the completion date for which such extension is requested, may, for good cause shown, extend said completion date for such length of time as the Common Council in its sole discretion deems justified by the circumstances. There shall be no limit upon the number of time extensions which may be requested. Upon failure of the developer to satisfactorily meet any phase or segment of the completion schedule, as determined by the Director, within thirty (30) days of the expiration date thereof or within thirty (30) days of denial by the Common Council for extension thereof, all permits and approvals shall be denied or suspended on other segments of the Precise Implementation Plan until such time as the developer is able to be in conformance with the completion schedule phasing. 
9)  Rescinding approval. Failure to comply with the conditions, commitments, guarantees, or the recommendations established in the approval of such development project shall be cause for rescinding the approval of the same. Upon notice given by the Director, the developer shall then be required to appear before the Common Council at its next public meeting to explain any such failure to comply. The Common Council at such hearing shall determine whether or not the developer shall have failed to comply and if there has been such a failure, may either: 
a)  Rescind its approval, whereupon such rescission and the cessation of all rights and privileges of the developer and owner, including the right to complete construction or to construct any building or other structure or improvements, shall become effective on the 31st day following mailing by certified mail to the developer at his or her last known address of a written notice of such rescission; or 
b)  Adjourn such hearing for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days to enable the developer to comply; whereupon, if the developer is then in substantial compliance and has then established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Council that there will be compliance in the future, the rights and privileges of the developer and owner shall continue for such period of time that there shall be such compliance. If the developer is not then in substantial compliance or does not establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Council that there will be compliance in the future, the Council will proceed in accordance with subparagraph a., immediately above. 
10)  Revocation; abandonment of plan; revocation to basic zoning regulations and uses. 
a)  In the event the developer shall fail to submit a Precise Implementation Plan as required herein, the General Development Plan shall be deemed revoked. 
b)  In the event the developer shall elect to abandon the General Development Plan, after same is approved and the area zoned PDD, the developer shall immediately notify the Common Council in writing and, upon receipt of such notice of abandonment, the General Development Plan shall be deemed revoked. 
c)  When rescissions occur pursuant to subsection (10), above, the area involved shall automatically revert to its underlying zoning and its applicable zoning regulations and uses.

Chapter 15 - SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING ORDINANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the shoreland-wetland zoning ordinance of the City of De Pere, Wisconsin. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 09-14, adopted June 16, 2009, deleted App. A, Zoning, and moved material in said appendix to new chapters 14-16 to read as set out herein and in said chapters 14 and 16. 

15-1. - Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District. 
(a)  Statutory authorization, findings of fact, statement of purpose and title. 
(1)  Statutory authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. § 62.231. 
(2)  Findings of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the shoreland-wetlands, rivers and streams, and the pollution of the navigable waters of the City would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. This ordinance promotes the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
(3)  Purpose. To promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare, and protect life, health, and property, this ordinance has been established to: 
a.  Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands; 
b.  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into waters of the state; 
c.  Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
d.  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; 
e.  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural vegetation, shoreland-wetland excavation, filling, and other earth moving activities. 
(4)  Title. This ordinance shall be known as the Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Ordinance of the City of De Pere. 
(Ord. No. 09-14, § 3, 6-16-2009) 
15-2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Compliance-other permits. Any development in shoreland-wetlands shall be in full compliance with the terms of this ordinance. (However, see Section 15-4 of this ordinance for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) It is the responsibility of the applicant to secure all other necessary permits from appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, including those required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
(b)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
(c)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of the De Pere Zoning Code which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. The more restrictive of either the Shoreland-Wetland District or Floodplain District regulations shall apply when a property is located in both zoning districts. 
(2)  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
(d)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this ordinance is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 116 or NR 117 and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 116 or NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
(e)  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
(f)  Maps. The maps designated below are hereby adopted and made part of this ordinance. They are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator. 
(1)  United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps revised and dated 1982. 
(2)  Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps stamped "FINAL" on February 5, 1992. 
(g)  Annexed areas. All shoreland annexed by the City of De Pere after May 7, 1982, is subject to the regulations of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 09-14, § 3, 6-16-2009; Ord. No. 14-08, § 1, 7-1-2014) 
15-3. - Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District boundaries. 
(a)  District boundaries of shoreland-wetlands. 
(1)  The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the City which are two acres or more in size and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this ordinance in Section 15-2(f) which are: 
a.  Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Department publication of "Surface Water Resources of Brown County" or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps. 
b.  Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this ordinance in Chapter 16 of the code. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in Chapter 16 of the code shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(2)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(3)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary, as mapped, is in error. If Department staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official zoning maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
(4)  Under Wis. Stats. § 144.26(2m), notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule, wetland zoning ordinances required under Wis. Stats. § 62.231 and Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 117 do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if: 
(A)  Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river; 
(B)  Those parts of the drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching; and 
(C)  Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use. 
(b)  Permitted uses in shoreland-wetlands. The following uses are permitted subject to the provisions of Wis. Stats. chs. 30 and 31 and the provisions of other local, state, and federal laws if such activities do not involve filling, flood drainage, dredging, ditching, tiling or excavation, or any other wetland alteration except as otherwise provided: 
(1)  Hiking, fishing, trapping, hunting, swimming, snowmobiling, and boating;

(7)  The maintenance and repair of existing drainage systems, where permissible under Wis. Stats. § 30.20 to restore pre-existing levels of drainage, including the minimum amount of filling necessary to dispose of dredged spoil, provided that the filling is permissible under Wis. Stats. ch. 30 and that dredged spoil is placed on existing spoil banks where possible; 
(8)  The construction and maintenance of piers, docks and walkways, observation decks and trail bridges built on pilings, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such construction or maintenance; 
(9)  The installation and maintenance of sealed tiles for the purpose of draining lands outside the shoreland-wetland zoning district provided that such installation or maintenance is done in a manner designed to minimize the adverse impact upon the natural functions of the shoreland-wetland; and 
(10)  The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of existing highways and bridges, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such maintenance, repair, replacement or reconstruction; 
(11)  The construction and maintenance of roads which are necessary for the continuity of the municipal street system, the provision of essential utility and emergency services or to provide access to uses permitted in this section, provided:

Chapter 16 - FLOODPLAIN ZONING ORDINANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the shoreland-wetland zoning ordinance of the City of De Pere, Wisconsin. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 09-14, adopted June 16, 2009, deleted App. A, Zoning, and moved material in said appendix to new chapters 14-16 to read as set out herein and in said chapters 14 and 15. 

16-1. - Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose, title and general provisions. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. § 62.23. 
(b)  Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  Title. This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of De Pere, Wisconsin. 
(e)  General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. 
a.  This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
b.  Any structures intended for human habitation within 100 feet of a floodplain that the Zoning Administrator deems susceptible to flooding must have the lowest opening a minimum of two feet above the regional or base flood elevation. If elevations do not exist, the City may require the owner to complete a flood study or to record an affidavit for unmapped floodplain onto the deed of the property. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps listed below, and as may be amended from time to time by the DNR or FEMA, and kept on file in the office of the De Pere Clerk. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Clerk, City of De Pere. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
Official maps: Based on the Brown County Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated (August 18, 2009), volume numbers (55009CV001A, 55009CV002A and 55009CV003A,) 
a.  Brown County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers (55009C0242F, 55009C0244F, 55009C0253F, 55009C0254F, 55009C0258F, 55009C0259F, 55009C0261F, 55009C0262F, 55009C0263F, 55009C0264F, 55009C0266F, 55009C0267F, and 55009C0268F) dated August 18, 2009; with corresponding profiles that are based on the FIS dated March 17, 2014, volume numbers 55009CV001B, 55009CV002B, and 55009CV003B. 
(3)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
b.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
c.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (A) or (B) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section 16-8. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 16-7(c) and the criteria in [a] and [b] below. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to Section 16-8(a). Once approvals have been obtained from the Department and FEMA, results must be submitted in a format that is compatible with the Brown County geographic information system (GIS). 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 16-8. 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC). 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by Wis. Adm. Code NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Brown County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wis. Adm. Code NR 116 and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(13)  General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 09-14, § 4, 6-16-2009; Ord. No. 14-06, §§ 1, 2, 3-18-2014) 
16-2. - General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. 
(a)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
(1)  Except as allowed in paragraph (3) below, no floodplain development shall: 
a.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or 
b.  Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of sub. (3) are met. 
(3)  Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are made to this ordinance, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with Section 16-8. 
Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR. Flood studies and flood analysis must be submitted in a format that is compatible with the Brown County geographic information system (GIS). 
(b)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, the zoning administrator shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting appropriate technical or scientific data in accordance with NFIP guidelines that shall be used to revise the FIRM, risk premium rates and floodplain management regulations as required. 
(c)  Wis. Stats. Chapters 30 AND 31, Development. Development which requires a permit from the Department, under Wis. Stats. Chs. 30 and 31, such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the floodway lines, water surface profiles, BFE's established in the FIS, or other data from the officially adopted FIRM, or other floodplain zoning maps or the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to Section 16-8.

This procedure shall include a written agreement between the campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator and the chief law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for conducting the evacuation. 
(5)  This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated - by the officials identified in sub. (4) - to remain in compliance with all applicable regulations, including those of the state department of health and family services and all other applicable regulations. 
(6)  Only camping units are allowed. 
(7)  The camping units may not occupy any site in the campground for more than 180 consecutive days, at which time the camping unit must be removed from the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours. 
(8)  All camping units that remain on site for more than 30 days shall be issued a limited authorization by the campground operator, a written copy of which is kept on file at the campground. Such authorization shall allow placement of a camping unit for a period not to exceed 180 days and shall ensure compliance with all the provisions of this section. 
(9)  The municipality shall monitor the limited authorizations issued by the campground operator to assure compliance with the terms of this section.

16-4. - Floodfringe district (FF). 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all floodfringe areas shown on the floodplain zoning maps and those identified pursuant to Section 16-5(d). 
(b)  Permitted uses. Any structure, land use, or development is allowed in the floodfringe district if the standards in Section 16-4(c) are met, the use is not prohibited by this or any other ordinance or regulation and all permits or certificates specified in Section 16-7(a) have been issued. 
(c)  Standards for development in floodfringe areas. Section 16-2(a) shall apply in addition to the following requirements according to the use requested. 
(1)  Residential uses. Any habitable structure, including a manufactured home, which is to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or moved into the floodfringe area, shall meet or exceed the following standards; 
a.  The elevation of the lowest opening of the foundation shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (which is a point two feet above the regional or base flood elevation). The fill shall be one foot or more above the regional flood elevation extending at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the structure. The Department may authorize other floodproofing measures if the elevations of existing streets or sewer lines makes compliance impractical and the Board of Appeals grants a variance; 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of structures with basements within A-zones and other identified floodplains shall be designed so that any basement area, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities below the floodproofed design level, is watertight with walls that are impermeable to the passage of water without human intervention. Basement walls (including sealed structural glass block windows) shall be built with the capacity to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy resulting from flooding which is two feet above the 100-year frequency flood, and shall be designed so that minimal structural damage will occur if this design is exceeded. The finished floor elevation of a basement or crawlway shall be no more than five (5) feet below the regional flood elevation for residential and commercial structures. Under this provision, the bottom of the lowest basement openings, such as doors and non-sealed windows, must be placed at least two feet above the 100-year regional flood elevation. [The City of De Pere received an exemption for construction below the flood level for flood-proofed basements from FEMA in 1978]. 
c.  Contiguous dryland access shall be provided from a structure to land outside of the floodplain, except as provided in paragraph d. 
d.  In developments where existing street or sewer line elevations make compliance with paragraph c. impractical, the municipality may permit new development and substantial improvements where access roads are at or below the regional flood elevation, if: 
i.  The municipality has written assurance from police, fire and emergency services that rescue and relief will be provided to the structure(s) by wheeled vehicles during a regional flood event; or 
ii.  The municipality has a natural disaster plan approved by Wisconsin Emergency Management and the Department. 
e.  The area surrounding the entire foundation must be filled to at least one foot above the 100-year regional flood line for a distance of 15 feet beyond the limits of the structure. 
f.  Floodproofed basements may not be constructed within the floodway. 
g.  Basements constructed in accordance with this subsection shall not be used for sleeping purposes. 
h.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards herein provided are incorporated in the building plans and specifications. This certification shall include the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure is floodproofed. Before occupancy of the structure the registered professional engineer or architect must site verify all aspects of the project and sign a certificate of compliance that must be submitted to the Brown County Zoning Office within 60 days of completion of the project. 
i.  The professional architect or engineer shall make or require inspections of the basement construction work to ascertain compliance with the above provisions. 
j.  A registered land surveyor or engineer must set a benchmark on the property to assure proper elevations except where a municipality has a benchmark established. This must be done by completing the benchmark certificate available at the De Pere Building Inspection Office. Once completed, the original signed benchmark certificate from the surveyor or engineer must be submitted to the De Pere Building Inspection Office. 
(2)  Accessory structures or uses. 
a.  Except as provided in par. b., an accessory structure which is not connected to a principal structure may be constructed with its lowest floor at or above the regional flood elevation. 
b.  An accessory structure which is not connected to the principal structure and which is less than 600 square feet in size and valued at less than $10,000 may be constructed with its lowest floor no more than two feet below the regional flood elevation if it is subject to flood velocities of no more than two feet per second and it meets all of the provisions of Sections 16-3(c)(1)a, b, c and d and 16-4(c)(5) below. 
(3)  Commercial uses. Any commercial structure which is erected, altered or moved into the floodfringe area shall meet the requirements of Section 16-4(c)(1). Subject to the requirements of Section 16-4(c)(5), storage yards, surface parking lots and other such uses may be placed at lower elevations if an adequate warning system exists to protect life and property. 
(4)  Manufacturing and industrial uses. Any manufacturing or industrial structure which is erected, altered or moved into the floodfringe area shall be protected to the flood protection elevation using fill, levees, floodwalls, or other flood proofing measures in Section 16-7(e). Subject to the requirements of Section 16-4(c)(5), storage yards, surface parking lots and other such uses may be placed at lower elevations if an adequate warning system exists to protect life and property. 
(5)  Storage of materials. Materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or injurious to property, water quality or human, animal, plant, fish or aquatic life shall be stored at or above the flood protection elevation or floodproofed in compliance with Section 16-7(e). Adequate measures shall be taken to ensure that such materials will not enter the water body during flooding. 
(6)  Public utilities, streets and bridges. All utilities, streets and bridges shall be designed to be compatible with comprehensive floodplain development plans; and 
a.  When failure of public utilities, streets and bridges would endanger public health or safety, or where such facilities are deemed essential, construction of and substantial improvements to such facilities may only be permitted if they are floodproofed in compliance with Section 16-7(e) to the flood protection elevation; 
b.  Minor roads or non-essential utilities may be constructed at lower elevations if they are designed to withstand flood forces to the regional flood elevation. 
(7)  Sewage systems. All on-site sewage disposal systems shall be floodproofed, pursuant to Section 16-7(e), to the flood protection elevation and shall meet the provisions of all local ordinances and Wis. Adm. Code COMM 83.

Sec. 26-12. - Private well regulation. 
(a)  Purpose. The common council finds and determines that private wells are a known pathway for the entrance of contaminants into groundwater aquifers, which aquifers also supply the municipal water system. It is further determined that cross connecting of private wells and municipal water sources may lead to such contamination. Contamination of the city's water supply would severely and adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of city residents, particularly since contamination once introduced is extremely difficult to correct. Therefore, it is necessary and in the public interest that all wells within the corporate limits of the city, whether existing or hereafter installed, shall be effectively monitored and regulated in regard to their creation, operation and abandonment as set forth in this section. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

    Noncomplying means a well or pump installation which does not comply with the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code NR ch. 112, in effect at the time the well was constructed, a contamination source was discovered, the pump was installed, or work was done on either the well or pump installation. 
    Pump installation means the pump and related equipment used for withdrawing water from a well, including discharge piping, ground connection, pitless adapters, pressure tanks, pits, sampling faucets and well seals or caps. 
    Unsafe means a well or pump installation which produces water which is bacteriologically contaminated or contaminated with substances exceeding the standards of Wis. Admin. Code NR chs. 809 or 140, or for which a health advisory has been issued by the state department of natural resources. 
    Unused means a well or pump installation which is not in use or does not have a functional pumping system. 
    Well means an excavation or opening into the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods for the purpose of obtaining groundwater for consumption or other use. 
    Well abandonment means the filling and sealing of a well in accordance with the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code NR ch. 112. 
(c)  Registration of wells. No new wells shall be constructed and installed nor shall any existing well be maintained unless the wells are registered with the water utility by the owner of the property upon which the wells are located, and unless all such wells are in complete requirements with the provisions of this section, section 26-11, and the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code NR ch. 112. The registration form shall require, at a minimum, the following information:

It shall be the responsibility of the landowner of any real property upon which a well is located to see to it that all wells located on the owner's property have been properly abandoned in accordance with the procedures of Wis. Admin. Code NR ch. 112, regardless of whether such owner has used such well. Upon discovery of any unused or previously abandoned well, the owner shall notify the water utility and comply, insofar as is practicable, with the procedures of subsection (g) of this section. In the case of a previously abandoned well, if the owner can produce proof of compliance with state well abandonment requirements to the satisfaction of the utilities manager/engineer, compliance with this section may be deemed unnecessary. Such determination shall be at the discretion of the utilities manager/engineer upon considering the present and future possibility of ground water contamination at the well site. 
(i)  Failure to properly abandon well public nuisance. Failure to abandon any well after revocation of a permit to follow the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code NR ch.112, in abandoning such well is hereby deemed a public nuisance, and the city may cause such well to be property abandoned and may assess the cost against the owner of the affected property and collect it as a special tax. 
(j)  Penalty. In addition to any and all other costs which may be incurred by property owner under the provisions of this section, any person who violates any provision of this section shall pay a forfeiture of not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00. From the time of written notice of such violation, each day of continuing violation of any provision of this section shall be considered a separate violation for the purposes of imposing forfeitures stated in this subsection.

Sec. 26-13. - Reserved. 
Sec. 26-14. - Water supply development charge created. 
(a)  Short title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the City of De Pere's Water Supply Development Charge Ordinance. 
(b)  Introduction and purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a mechanism to recover the development costs imposed on the city by the water authority. The water authority charges the city for new connections to the city's water system in areas outside the city's boundaries as they existed on December 1, 2003. The purpose of this section is to pass those charges on to the property owner seeking the new connection since that property owner is directly responsible for the costs imposed on the city by the water authority. 
(c)  Permit. Each person, corporation, partnership, public agency, or other entity (hereinafter referred to as "a water user") shall obtain a permit from the city before installing a new water meter. The city shall determine the size of the water meter necessary or appropriate to provide service to the water user. 
    (d) Charge; generally. If the new water meter is for a new connection to the city's water system in an area that was annexed or added to the city's boundaries since December 1, 2003, the water user who obtains a permit under subsection (c) shall pay a water supply development charge to the city at the time of the application for the permit. Such water supply development charge shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (e), and shall equal the charge imposed by the water authority on the city. 
(e)  Schedule of charges. The amount of the water supply development charge shall be based upon the size of the meter to be installed. The water supply development charge shall equal $50.00 multiplied by a factor determined by the size of meter to be installed, with a maximum charge of $260.00 per meter. The size of the meter, the appropriate factor, and the resulting water supply development charge is set forth on the following table: 
Meter Size (inches) Factor Water Supply Development Charge Under 1" 1.0 $50.00 1" 1.6 80.00 1.5" 3.0 150.00 2" or greater 5.2 260.00  
(f)  Responsibility for payment of charges. All required water supply development charges shall be paid in full prior to issuance of a permit under subsection (c). Payment of the water supply development charge is the responsibility of the property owner of record at the time a permit under subsection (c) of this section is requested. 
(g)  Collection of charges. Water supply development charges paid to and collected by the city shall be placed in a segregated, interest-bearing account called the water supply development charge account. Such funds shall be accounted for separately from other of the city's general and utility funds. 
(h)  Payment of charges to water authority. All funds, excluding interest, accumulated in the water supply development charge account established by the city shall be turned over to the water authority semi-annually on dates established by the water authority. The water authority shall use the funds to reduce the fixed costs of the water authority. Any interest income earned by the monies in the water supply development charge account need not be turned over to the water authority, but may be used by the city to help pay administrative costs of implementing this section. 
(i)  Waiver. the city may waive the collection of a water supply development charge from any property owner if the city itself agrees to be responsible for the payment of such charge. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1, 1-18-2005)

(a)  Introduction and purpose. This section is enacted in cooperation with the Central Brown County water authority ("water authority") and its member communities - Allouez, Bellevue, DePere, Howard, Town of Lawrence, and Ledgeview Sanitary District No. 2 - to support the implementation of a water conservation and management plan. The goal of this conservation and management plan is to preserve the water resources of the region and to extend the value and life of the infrastructure assets used in supplying water, without jeopardizing public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  Public education. The city shall at least once a year provide to its customers information regarding water conservation methods. Information may be provided by community newsletter, local newspaper, radio, television, new homeowners and business information packets, or information provided to students and teachers through school newsletters. The information provided shall include: (1) information on water consumption and use by customers; (2) tips on water conservation; (3) recommended lawn length and mowing practices; (4) recommended lawn care water amounts; (5) information on use of automatic sprinkler systems; (6) when to water for best results; (7) information on flow control on hoses; (8) information on the impact of water usage on the environment and public water systems; (9) information on in-house water fixture reductions (i.e. showerhead, reduced toilet flush, laundry etc.); and (10) information on the impact to the public if conservation methods are not used. This information may be provided in conjunction with the water authority and other water authority members. 
(c)  Determination of water shortage. A water shortage shall be deemed to exist when the water authority advises the city and the other member communities that the water authority may not be able to supply sufficient potable water to meet the current or expected level of customer demand due to conditions not under their control. The water authority shall declare a stage I water shortage if extreme dry weather conditions require moderate water conservation. The water authority shall declare a stage II water shortage if continuing extreme dry weather conditions require a high level of water conservation. The water authority may also declare a stage I or stage II water shortage if any other circumstances, including service losses caused by equipment failure, human error, weather, or other natural disaster, constrains the water authority's water supply to less than the current level of customer demand. 
(d)  Declaration of water shortage. In the event of a water shortage as determined in subsection (c), the water authority shall issue a public declaration of the water shortage. Upon such declaration, the city shall place in effect the restrictive provisions hereinafter authorized. The city shall inform the public about the water use restrictions and the reasons for those restrictions. Information shall be provided in the same manner as set forth in subsection (b). 
(e)  Mandatory conservation during stage I water shortage. Except as provided below, in the event the water authority declares a stage I water shortage, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to use or permit the use of potable water within the city for any of the purposes hereinafter set forth until the water authority, by public declaration, has declared the stage I water shortage to be lifted. 
Exception-Watering of lawns is restricted to the following: House numbers ending in an even number may water on even numbered days of the month. House numbers ending in an odd number may water on the odd days of the month. However, all watering must be done between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to midnight. Watering of trees, shrubs and flowers may be done at any time using a hand held hose. 
(f)  Mandatory conservation during stage II water shortage. In the event the water authority declares a stage II water shortage, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to use or permit the use of potable water within the city for any of the purposes hereinafter set forth until the water authority, by public proclamation, has declared the stage II water shortage to be lifted. No outside use of water is allowed. Outside use is referred to but not limited to the following: (i) no watering of lawn, flowers or shrubs; and (ii) no washing of vehicles, recreational equipment, driveways, decks, porches or structures. 
(g)  Penalties. Any person who violates this chapter or any provision thereof shall be subject to a forfeiture as determined by resolution of the council, plus costs, fees, assessments and penalties as required by law. Each act of violation and every day upon which a violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate offense.

(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-4. - Connection. 
    Property owners shall be required to connect to any stormwater conveyance system as required pursuant to section 26-5, De Pere Municipal Code. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-5. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  By this chapter, the common council hereby establishes that a rate charge shall be imposed upon all real property within the City of De Pere for services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility. The actual rate to be imposed, the establishment of formula for calculations of the charges, the establishment of specific customer classifications and any future changes in those rates, formulas, rate charges, and customer classifications shall be as determined by resolution of the common council. All rates established pursuant to this chapter shall be kept on file by the city clerk. 
Rate charges may include: 
(1)  Base charge (BC) - A base charge may be imposed on all property in the city. The BC shall reflect the fact that all properties contribute in some way to the stormwater discharge that must be managed by the city and that all properties benefit from stormwater management activities of the city. The BC shall be sufficient to cover administrative costs of the stormwater utility and that portion of capital costs which are covered by special assessment. The BC may be based on parcel size. 
(2)  Equivalent runoff unit charge (ERU charge) - An ERU charge may be imposed on all property in the city. The formula for the ERU charge shall reflect that of a typical single-family unit. Other units of property will be charged multiples of the ERU based on the impervious area contributing to surface water runoff. 
a.  The average square footage of impervious area of ERU is hereby established to be equivalent to 3,861 square feet. 
b.  The charge imposed for single-family structure shall be the rate for one ERU. 
c.  The charge imposed for duplex residential properties shall be the rate of 0.7 of one ERU for each individual dwelling unit existing on the property. (ERU rate multiplied by the number of dwelling units.) 
d.  The charge imposed for residential - multifamily units properties shall be the rate of one-half of one ERU for each individual dwelling unit existing on the property. (ERU rate multiplied by the number of dwelling units.) 
e.  The charge imposed for residential - condominium unit properties shall be the rate of 0.7 of one ERU for each individual dwelling unit existing on the property. (ERU rate multiplied by the number of dwelling units.) 
f.  The charge imposed for nonresidential properties as defined herein shall be the rate of one ERU, multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of a non-residential property by the square footage of one ERU. The factor shall be rounded down to the nearest one-tenth, i.e. 
ERU rate X impervious area 
ERU 
g.  The charges imposed for platted undeveloped properties as defined herein shall be the rate of one-half of one ERU per lot. 
h.  The charges imposed for unplatted undeveloped properties as defined herein shall be the rate of one-half of one ERU per acre where such property discharges stormwater into stormwater facilities constructed, financed or maintained by the stormwater utility. There shall be no charge for unplatted, undeveloped properties which do not discharge stormwater into facilities constructed, financed or maintained by the stormwater utility. 
i.  The director of public works shall be responsible for determining the impervious area based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the city assessor, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or developer. The director of public works may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. 
j.  The minimum charges for any nonresidential parcel shall be equal to the rate for one ERU. 
k.  All unoccupied developed lots and parcels shall be subject to the stormwater utility charges. 
(3)  Credit - The common council may provide for a credit or system of credits against charges for facilities installed and maintained by property owner for the purpose of limiting stormwater flow from the subject property. 
(b)  The city's finance department shall take all steps necessary to invoice all charges and collect all stormwater utility payments for the city stormwater utility. 
(c)  Stormwater utility charges shall be allocated to the property served and included on the property tax bill for such property. Billings for stormwater utility charges shall be mailed to owners of record for tax-exempt property. 
(d)  Stormwater utility charges shall not be payable in installments. If stormwater utility charges remain unpaid for a period of 20 days from the date the first installment of tax payment is due, such bill shall become a delinquent special charge and shall become a lien as provided in Wis. Stats §§ 66.0627(4). Said charges shall automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charges. Unpaid charges shall be assessed a three percent late payment charge to bills not paid within 20 days of last date of tax payment. 
(e)  All delinquent special charges shall be subject to a ten percent penalty in addition to all other charges and prior penalties or interest when the delinquent special charge is extended upon the tax roll. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-6. - Customer classification. 
(a)  For purposes of imposing the stormwater utility charges, all lots and parcel within the city are initially classified into the following seven customer classes: 
(1)  Residential - Single-family 
(2)  Residential - Duplex 
(3)  Residential - Multifamily units 
(4)  Residential - Condominium 
(5)  Nonresidential 
(6)  Agricultural 
(7)  Undeveloped 
The council may, by resolution, amend, alter or otherwise reclassify such customer class as are likely to provide fair distribution of the costs of the stormwater utility. 
(b)  The director of public works shall prepare a list of lots and parcels within the city and assign such appropriate classification to each lot or parcel. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-7. - New construction. 
(a)  Except for single-family structures, a property owner shall be responsible for submitting a stormwater utility service application at the time a building permit application is submitted or a site plan review is conducted, whichever occurs sooner. The application shall be made on a form prescribed by the city and provided with each application for a building permit or application for site plan review. No building permit shall be issued until such application is submitted and approved by the director of public works. 
(b)  The property owner shall be liable for all stormwater charges attributable to such property from the date of commencement of construction. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-8. - Method of appeal. 
(a)  The stormwater utility charge may be appealed as follows: 
(1)  Within 30 days of payment, a written appeal to the stormwater charge must be filed with the city clerk on behalf of the property owner, specifying the reason for challenge and the amount of the stormwater charge the property owner asserts is appropriate. Failure to file an appeal within 30 days of payment or nonpayment of the charge shall operate as a waiver of appeal by the property owner. 
(2)  The finance/personnel shall hear such appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting, and determine whether the stormwater charge is fair and reasonable. All decisions of the board shall be in writing and sent to the appellant within 30 days of such decision. 
(b)  The property owner may, within 15 days from the date the decision of the board is mailed, file a written appeal to the common council. 
(c)  The common council shall hear such appeal and determine whether the fee charged is fair and reasonable. The decision of the council shall be a final decision. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-9. - Special charge authority. 
    In addition to any other method for collection of the charges established pursuant to this chapter for stormwater utility costs, the common council finds that charges may be levied against real property as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. The charges established hereunder reasonably reflect costs of current services rendered and the benefits conferred on property and therefore may be charged against the property accordingly. Mailing of such charges to the property owner shall serve as notice that failure to pay the charges when due may result in the imposition of a special charge under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-10. - Budget excess revenues. 
    The stormwater utility finances shall be accounted for in a separate stormwater enterprise fund by the city. The utility shall prepare an annual budget, subject to approval by the common council, which is to include all operation and maintenance costs, debt service and other costs related to the operation of the stormwater utility. Any excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be retained by the stormwater enterprise fund for subsequent years' needs. 
(Ord. No. 05-33, § 2, 8-16-2005) 
Sec. 27-11. - Severability. 
    In the event any section, subsection, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is for any reason held illegal, invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this chapter. It is the legislative intent of the common council that this chapter would have been adopted if such illegal provision had not been included or any illegal application had not been made.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 16-22, § 1, adopted Oct. 4, 2016, repealed the former Ch. 28, §§ 28-1-28-15, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 28 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, adopted Feb. 3, 2009. 

Sec. 28-1. - Authority. 
(a)  This chapter is adopted by the common council under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 62.234. This chapter supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats. § 62.234, Wis. Stats. § 62.23 applies to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
(c)  The common council hereby designates the director of public works or designee to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  The requirements of this chapter do not pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code. 
(Ord. No. 16-22, § 1, 10-4-2016) 
Sec. 28-2. - Findings of fact. 
    The common council finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(g)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
(Ord. No. 16-22, § 1, 10-4-2016) 
Sec. 28-3. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(4)  Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of the common council that this chapter regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This chapter may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The common council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council, it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

d.  The amount of total suspended solids control previously required for the site shall not be reduced as a result of the proposed development or disturbance. 
e.  Off-Site Drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from off-site shall be taken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP accordingly. 
f.  Notwithstanding subsections (c)(1)a-d., if the design cannot achieve the applicable total suspended solids reduction specified, the stormwater management plan shall include a written and site-specific explanation why that level of reduction is not attained and the total suspended solids load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. 
g.  For redevelopment in the Lower Fox River Subbasin, an incentive is available for additional treatment of total suspended solids and total phosphorous as follows: 
Watershed Redevelopment Routine Maintenance Lower Fox River TSS TP TSS TP 80% 30% 80% 30%  
For sites that meet both the TSS and TP Additional reductions, the annual stormwater management fee will be reduced by 50%. Documentation requirements can be found in the Stormwater Reference Guide. 
(2)  Peak discharge. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to control peak discharges from the post-construction site as follows: 
a.  For post-construction sites with one or more of the following:

These peak discharge requirements apply to new development and redevelopment areas. No peak discharge control is required for routine maintenance areas, unless runoff from the routine maintenance area discharges into a proposed peak flow control facility. 
(ii)  TR-55 methodology shall be used for peak discharge calculations, unless the administering authority approves an equivalent methodology. The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. Peak pre-development discharge rates shall be determined using the following "meadow" runoff curve numbers: 
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers-Meadow Hydrologic soil group A B C D Runoff curve number 30 58 71 78  
b.  For post-construction sites with less than 20,000 square feet of impervious surface disturbance, reduce peak post-development discharge rates using BMPs from the city stormwater reference guide. These sites are not required to satisfy a numeric performance standard. 
c.  Sites with a cumulative addition of 20,000 square feet or greater of impervious surfaces after the adoption date February 3, 2009, of this chapter are required to satisfy the performance standards within subsection (c)(2)a.2.i-ii. 
d.  The amount of peak discharge control previously required for the site shall not be reduced as a result of the proposed development or disturbance. 
e.  An adequate outfall shall be provided for each point of concentrated discharge from the post-construction site. An adequate outfall consists of non-erosive discharge velocities and reasonable downstream conveyance. 
f.  Exemptions. The following transportation facilities are not required to meet the peak discharge requirements of subsection (c)(2) provided the transportation facility is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale: 
1.  A transportation facility where the change in hydrology due to development does not increase the existing surface water elevation at any point within the downstream receiving surface water by more than 0.01 of a foot for the two-year, 24-hour storm event. 
2.  A highway reconstruction site. 
3.  A transportation facility that is part of a redevelopment project. 
(3)  Infiltration. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following, except as provided in subsections (c)(3)h-k. 
a.  For post construction sites with one or more of the following: 
1.  Twenty thousand square feet or more of impervious surface disturbance and/or 
2.  Post-construction sites with one acre or more of land disturbance one of the following shall be met: 
(i)  Low imperviousness. For development up to 40 percent connected imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and low density residential development, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 90 percent of the pre-development infiltration volumes, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
(ii)  Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than 40 percent and up to 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as medium and high density residential, multi-family development, industrial and institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 75 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
(iii)  High imperviousness. For development with more than 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
b.  Predevelopment condition shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology approved by the administering authority. The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. However, when pre-development land cover is cropland, rather than using TR-55 values for cropland, the following runoff curve numbers shall be used: 
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers-Cropland Hydrologic Soil Group A B C D Runoff Curve Number 55 69 78 83  
c.  For residential and non-residential developments with less than 20,000 square feet of new impervious surfaces, infiltrate runoff volume using BMPs from the stormwater reference guide. These sites are not required to satisfy a numeric performance standard. 
d.  Sites with a cumulative addition of 20,000 square feet or greater of impervious surfaces after the adoption date February 3, 2009, of this chapter are required to satisfy the performance standards within subsections 28-7(c)(3)a-b. 
e.  The amount of infiltration previously required for the site shall not be reduced as a result of the proposed development or disturbance. 
f.  Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with subsection [(c)(3)n.] Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips. 
g.  Source Area Prohibitions. Infiltration of runoff from the following areas are prohibited from meeting the infiltration requirements of this subsection [(c)(3)]: 
1.  Areas associated with tier 1 industrial facilities identified in § NR 216.21(2)(a), Wis. Adm. Code, including storage, loading, rooftop and parking.

j.  Separation Distances. 
1.  Infiltration practices shall be located so that the characteristics of the soil and the separation distance between the bottom of the infiltration system and the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock are in accordance with the table below: 
Separation Distances and Soil Characteristics Source Area Separation Distance Soil Characteristics Industrial, Commercial, Institutional Parking Lots and Roads 5 feet or more Filtering Layer Residential Arterial Roads 5 feet or more Filtering Layer Roofs Draining to Subsurface Infiltrations Practices 1 foot or more Native or Engineered Soil with Particles Finer than Coarse Sand Roofs Draining to Surface Infiltration Practices Not Applicable Not Applicable All Other Impervious Source Areas 3 feet or more Filtering Layer  
2.  Notwithstanding subsection 1, applicable requirements for injection wells classified under ch. NR 815 shall be followed. 
k.  Infiltration Rate Exemption. Infiltration practices located in the following areas may be credited toward meeting the requirements under the following conditions, but the decision to infiltrate under these conditions is optional: 
1.  Where the infiltration rate of the soil measured at the proposed bottom of the infiltration system is less than six-tenths of one inch per hour using a scientifically credible field test method. 
2.  Where the least permeable soil horizon to five feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration system using the U.S. Department of Agriculture method of soils analysis is one of the following: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay. 
l.  Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this paragraph. 
m.  Groundwater Standards. 
1.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with ch. NR 140. However, if site specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection 1., the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
n.  Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial, and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with subsection (c)(3)m. 
o.  Maximum Extent Practicable. Where the conditions of subsections (c)(3)g.,h., and i. limit or restrict the use of infiltration practices, the performance standard of this subsection (c)(3) shall be met to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Protective areas. 
a.  "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this paragraph, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
1.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, and for wetlands in areas of special natural resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, 75 feet. 
2.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet. 
3.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
4.  For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrub swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows, shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded basins. 
5.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass, cultivated hydric soils, and any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill material disposal sites that take on the attributes of a wetland. 
6.  In subsections (c)(4)a.1.4. and 5. determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in § NR 103.03. 
7.  Wetlands shall be delineated. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with § NR 103.08(1m). This [subsection (c)(4)] does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that location. 
8.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
9.  Notwithstanding subsections 1. to 8., the greatest protective area width shall apply where rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands are contiguous. 
b.  Subsection (c)(4) applies to post-construction sites located within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subsection (c)(4)e. below. 
c.  The following requirements shall be met: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction. 
2.  Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
Note to users: It is recommended that seeding of non-invasive vegetative cover be used in the protective areas. Some invasive plants that should not be used are listed in ch. NR 40, Wis. Adm. Code. Vegetation that is flood and drought tolerant and can provide long-term bank stability because of an extensive root system is preferable. Vegetative cover can be measured using the line transect method described in the University of Wisconsin Extension publication number A3533, titled "Estimating Residue Using the Line Transect Method". 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area. 
Note to Users: Other laws, such as ch. 30, Wis. Stats., and chs. NR 103, 115, 116, and 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and their associated review and approval processes may apply in the protective area. 
d.  A protective area established or created after the adoption date [Insert adoption date] of this chapter shall not be eliminated or reduced, except as allowed in subsections (c)(4)e.2-4. below. 
e.  Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the protective area requirements of subsection (c)(4): 
1.  Redevelopment and routine maintenance areas provided the minimum requirements within in [subsection (c)(4)e.] above are satisfied. 
2.  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts. 
3.  Structures constructed in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 59.692(1v). 
4.  Post-construction sites from which runoff does not enter the surface water, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability. 
Note to users: A vegetated protective area to filter runoff pollutants from post-construction sites described in subsection (c)(4)e.4. is not necessary since runoff is not entering the surface water at that location. Other practices, necessary to meet the requirements of this section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the runoff enters a surface water of the state. 
(5)  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
Note to users: A combination of the following BMPs may be used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup materials, or any other structural or non-structural method of preventing or treating petroleum in runoff. 
(6)  Swale treatment for transportation facilities. Subsection (c)(6) is not applicable to transportation facilities that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale. 
a.  Requirement. Except as provided in [subsection (c)(6)b.], transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent practicable to do all of the following: 
1.  Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, non-vegetative measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams. 
Note to users: It is preferred that tall and dense vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its greater effectiveness at enhancing runoff pollutant removal. 
2.  Swales shall comply with sections V.F. (Velocity and Depth) and V.G. (Sale Geometry Criteria) with a swale treatment length as long as that specified in section V.C. (Pre-Treatment) of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources technical standard 1005 "Vegetated Infiltration Swales", dated May 2007, or a superseding document. Transportation facility swale treatment does not have to comply with other sections of technical standard 1005. 
Note to users: Check dams may be included in the swale design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant removal. Transportation facilities with continuous features such as curb and gutter, sidewalks or parking lanes do not comply with the design requirements of this paragraph. However, a limited amount of structural measures such as curb and gutter may be allowed as necessary to account for other concerns such as human safety or resource protection. 
b.  Exemptions. The director of public works may, consistent with water quality standards, require other provisions of this section be met on a transportation facility with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than 2500 and where the initial surface water of the state that the runoff directly enters is any of the following: 
1.  An outstanding resource water. 
2.  An exceptional resource water. 
3.  Waters listed in § 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due to nonpoint source impacts. 
4.  Waters where targeted performance standards are developed under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code, to meet water quality standards. 
Note to users: The transportation facility authority shall contact the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource's regional storm water staff or the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource's liaison to the Wisconsin Department of transportation to determine if additional BMPs beyond a water quality swale are needed under this subsection. 
(7)  Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the performance standards within subsection (c) of this section: 
a.  Agricultural production areas with less than 100,000 square feet of impervious surface disturbance. 
b.  Underground utility construction such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, cable television, and fiber optic lines. This exemption does not apply to the construction of any above ground structures associated with utility construction. 
c.  The following transportation facilities are exempt, provided the transportation facility is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale. 
1.  Reconditioning or resurfacing of a highway. 
2.  Minor reconstruction of a highway. Notwithstanding this exemption, the protective area requirements within NR 151.24(6) Wisconsin Administrative Code apply to minor reconstruction of a highway. 
3.  A redevelopment transportation facility with no increase in exposed parking lots or roads. 
4.  A transportation facility with less than ten percent connected imperviousness based on complete development of the transportation facility, provided the cumulative area of all parking lots and rooftops is less than one acre. 
5.  Routine maintenance for transportation facilities if performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility. 
6.  Routine maintenance if performed for storm water conveyance system cleaning. 
(d)  General considerations for onsite and offsite stormwater management measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing runoff: 
(1)  Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream property or public safety. 
(e)  Location and regional treatment option. 
(1)  The BMPs may be located onsite or offsite as part of a regional stormwater device, practice or system. 
(2)  Post-construction runoff within a non-navigable surface water that flows into a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not required to meet the performance standards of this chapter. Post-construction BMPs may be located in non-navigable surface waters. 
(3)  Except as allowed under subsection [(e)(4)], post-construction runoff from new development shall meet the post-construction performance standards prior to entering a navigable surface water. 
(4)  Post-construction runoff from any development within a navigable surface water that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the performance standards of this chapter if: 
a.  The BMP was constructed prior to the effective date of this chapter and the BMP either received a permit issued under Wis. Stats. ch. 30 or the BMP did not require a Wis. Stats. ch. 30 permit; and 
b.  The BMP is designed to provide runoff treatment from future upland development. 
(5)  Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and in-fill areas shall meet the post-construction performance standards in accordance with this paragraph. 
a.  To the maximum extent practicable, BMPs shall be located to treat runoff prior to discharge to navigable surface waters. 
b.  Post-construction BMPs for such runoff may be located in a navigable surface water if allowable under all other applicable federal, state and local regulations such as ch. NR 103, Wis. Adm. Code and Wis. Stats. ch. 30. 
(6)  The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, or after a series of such BMPs is subject to this chapter. 
Note to users: This section does not supersede any other applicable federal, state or local regulation such as ch. NR 103, Wis. Adm. Code and Wis. Stats. ch. 30. 
(7)  The director of public works may approve off-site management measures provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The director of public works determines that the post-construction runoff is covered by a stormwater management system plan that is approved by the department of public works and that contains management requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
b.  The offsite facility meets all of the following conditions: 
1.  The facility is in place. 
2.  The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the performance standards of this chapter. 
3.  The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance. 
(8)  Where a regional treatment option exists such that the director of public works exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum on-site stormwater management requirements, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount determined in negotiation with the director of public works. In determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the director of public works shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance of the regional treatment option. 
(f)  Alternate requirements. The director of public works may establish stormwater management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this section if the director of public works determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect sensitive resources. Also, the director of public works may establish stormwater management requirements less stringent than those set forth in this section if the director of public works determines that less protection is needed to protect sensitive resources and provide reasonable flood protection. However, the alternative requirements shall not be less stringent than those requirements promulgated in rules by the state department of natural resources under NR 151 Wisconsin Administrative Code.

The director of public works may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director of public works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter.

The director of public works may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the director of public works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(3)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The director of public works will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the director of public works for a reconsideration and hearing. 
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the director of public works. 
(e)  Prosecution and penalties. In addition to other penalties as may be provided herein, any person who violates this chapter shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $1.00 nor more than $1,000.00 per occurrence. Each act of violation and every day upon which a violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate violation.

Sec. 30-5. - Regulation of use of city boat ramps and docking facilities. 
(a)  Purpose. The city operates and maintains boat landing and docking facilities as a public service. The boating activity within the areas of such facilities is substantial, and the public safety and welfare requires that the use of the property be regulated in such a manner that accidents between persons using boats in the area and persons desiring to enter the water for swimming purposes may be prevented. Because the primary intended purpose of the boat docking and ramp facilities is related to the landing and docking of boats, the regulations of this section are enacted to avoid the inherently dangerous situation created by mixed recreational use of the facilities. 
(b)  Swimming and wading. Except to the extent necessary for the safe and proper launching or landing of a boat or other water vehicle, no persons shall enter or remain in the Fox River from the shoreline within 100 feet of any public boat ramp or docking facility owned or operated by the city or from any such dock or boat ramp facility for the purpose of swimming or wading. This section is intended to prohibit recreational swimming and other recreational activities not directly associated with the launch of a watercraft. 
(c)  No vehicles on docks. No person shall operate, use or otherwise be present upon any motorcycle, bicycle, unicycle or other toy vehicle including, without limitation by enumeration, skateboards, roller skis and roller skates on any public dock or boat ramp owned or operated by the city. 
(d)  Water skiing. Wis. Stats. § 30.69(3) is adopted in this subsection by reference. No boat towing persons engaged in water skiing, aquaplaning or other similar activities shall engage in such activity within 100 feet of a public boat landing or dock. 
(e)  Park department to post signs. The park department shall erect and maintain appropriate signs upon such property advising the public of the regulations of this section. 
(Code 1974, § 9.041) 
Sec. 30-6. - Use of park by private and public groups. 
    The director of parks and recreation shall permit the use of parks for recreational activities according to the rules and regulations of the board of park commissioners. The director of parks and recreation may lease or permit to be used the public parks for private or public groups restricting the use of the park or portions of the park to the group. The leasing of the park known as the county fairgrounds to the Northeastern Wisconsin Fair Association shall be approved by the council. 
(Code 1974, § 9.05) 
Sec. 30-7. - Duties of police. 
    It shall be the duty of the police department and its officers to enforce this chapter and the park rules and regulations of the board of park commissioners under the direction of the mayor and common council. No person shall resist or in any way interfere with any police officer, director or park employee or their subordinates in the discharge of his or her duty or hinder or prevent any of them from discharging his duty in any park or on the waters of the Fox River. It shall also be the duty of all persons in the park or on the waters of the Fox River when called upon by any of the such officials to promptly heed and assist such officer in the discharge of his or her duty. Any person failing to aid in the assistance of such official when called upon to do so shall be in violation of this section.

Sec. 38-4. - Historic structure, historic site and historic district designation criteria. 
(a)  For purposes of this chapter, an historic structure, historic site, or historic district designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved, including any building, improvement, or structure located thereon, or any area of particular historic, architectural, archeological, or cultural significance to the city, such as historic structures, sites, or districts which: 
(1)  Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nature, state, or community; 
(2)  Are identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state, or local history; 
(3)  Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; 
(4)  Are representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer, or architect who influenced his or her age; or 
(5)  Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history. 
(b)  The commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for historic structure, historic site, and historic district designation providing such are in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1974, § 11.04; Ord. No. 02-01, § 1, 1-2-2002; Ord. No. 13-17, § 15, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 38-5. - Powers and duties of commission. 
(a)  Designation nomination and recommendation. The commission shall have the power to nominate and to recommend to the common council that the Council approve local historic structure, site and district designations, subject to the procedures of section 38-6. Such designation recommendation shall be made based on the criteria set forth in section 38-4. If designated by the council, such historic structures, sites, and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration, and demolition. 
(1)  No owner or person in charge of an historic structure, historic site, or structure within an historic district shall reconstruct, alter, or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties, or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property, or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the historic preservation commission. Unless such certificate has been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(2)  Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the commission, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
a.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy, or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is to be done; 
b.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon an historic site or within an historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district; 
c.  In the case of any property located in an historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district; 
d.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city and state; 
e.  The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture, and/or material that it could not be reproduced without great difficulty and/or expense; 
f.  Except as provided herein, in the case of a request for the demolition of a deteriorated building or structure, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair. Upon the request for a demolition permit for a structure determined to be unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or use by any authorized public official or agency, the commission may defer the granting of approval for a period of up to six months from the time of such application, during which time the commission and the property owner shall undertake serious and continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method to save such property. During such period, the property owner and the commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property. At the end of this six-month period, if no mutually agreeable method of saving the subject property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is under way, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the subject property is pending, the building inspector may issue the permit to demolish the subject property without the approval of the commission. If such mutually agreeable method for saving the subject property is not successful or no such funds to preserve the subject property have been obtained and available for disbursement within a period of two months following the end of such six-month period, the building inspector may issue the permit to demolish the subject property without the approval of the commission. 
(3)  In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following standards: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time. Those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(4)  If the commission determines that the application for a certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district and with the above guidelines, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the building inspector. The commission shall make this decision within 45 days of the filing of the application. Failure of the commission to act upon a request for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days shall result in the issuance of such certificate. 
(5)  Agencies of the city and all public utility and transportation companies undertaking projects affecting historic structures, historic sites, or historic districts shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures, and buildings on property, easements, or streets owned or franchised by the city. 
(6)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the city. A building permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to an historic structure, historic site, or improvement in an historic district designated under this section, any provision of the plumbing code, electrical code, or building or housing of the city shall apply unless waived by the appropriate state or city officials. The commission may support or propose such waivers before the appropriate state or city appeals body. 
(7)  Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started within 12 months after the issuance of the certificate, and the work shall conform to the provisions of the certificate. The city may inspect the work during and after construction in order to assure compliance. Failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate of appropriateness shall be a violation of this section. In addition to other penalties and remedies, the city shall issue a stop work order, and all work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. 
(8)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness provided the work involves repairs to existing features of an historic structure or site, or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance, and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  Appeals. Should the commission deny a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the common council within 30 days. In addition, if the commission denies a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter. 
(d)  Recognition of historic structures, sites, and districts. At such time as an historic structure, site, or district has been properly designated, the commission may cause to be prepared and erected on such property, at city expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is an historic structure, site, or district. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing pedestrians. The plaque shall state the accepted name of the historic property, the date of its construction, and other information deemed proper by the commission. 
(e)  Other duties. In addition to those duties already specified in this section, the commission shall: 
(1)  Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historical heritage of the city and the historic properties designated under the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Cooperate with the state historic preservation officer and the state historic preservation review board in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as landmarks or landmark sites, or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and the State Register of Historic Places. 
(3)  As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of historic preservation in the city. Such funds shall be placed in a special city account for such purpose. 
(Code 1974, § 11.05; Ord. No. 02-01, § 1, 1-2-2002; Ord. No. 16-23B.2.0, § 1, 11-1-2016) 
Sec. 38-6. - Procedures. 
(a)  Designation of historic structures and historic sites. 
(1)  The commission may nominate the designation of historic structures and sites, after notification to the property owner(s) of the subject property, by conducting a public hearing thereon. Notice of the public hearing shall be published as a class 1 notice under Wisconsin Statutes. At least ten days prior to such hearing, the commission shall notify, by first class mail, the owner(s) of the structure or site subject to designation and the owners of record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of property in whole or in part situated within 100 feet of the boundaries of subject property, of the proposed designation and of the time and place of the public hearing thereon. These owners shall have the right to confer with the commission prior to final action by the commission on the designation. The commission shall also notify the following: department of public works, redevelopment authority, parks department, fire and police departments, health department, building inspection department, and plan commission. Each such department may respond to the commission with its comments on the proposed designation or rescission. 
(2)  The commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary, and the commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission, all as necessary to determine if the structure or site meets the designation criteria of section 38-4. Within ten days after the close of the public hearing, if the commission determines to recommend designation of the structure or site to the common council, it shall notify the owner of the property subject to designation of such decision by first class mail. The commission shall also forward its recommendation to the common council. 
(3)  The common council. The common council, upon receipt of the recommendation from the historic preservation commission shall consider such recommendation, with notice of the council meeting at which the matter is to be considered given as noted in subsection (a)(1) above. The council shall either approve or reject the historic designation. Upon approval of the designation, the common council shall cause the designation to be recorded, at city expense, in the county register of deeds office. 
(b)  Designation of historic districts. 
(1)  For preservation purposes, the historic preservation commission shall select geographically defined areas within the city to be designated as historic districts and shall, with the assistance of the city planning department, prepare an historic preservation plan in ordinance form for each area for nomination as an historic district. An historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the city, which: 
a.  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nation, state, or community; 
b.  Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state, or local history; 
c.  Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of architectural types or specimens inherently valuable for the study of a period or periods, styles, methods, or construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; 
d.  Is representative of the notable works of master builders, designers, or architects who influenced their age; or 
e.  Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to history or prehistory. 
(2)  Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the historic preservation commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development, and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(3)  Guideline criteria to be considered in the development of historic district plans are as follows: 
a.  Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration, and demolition shall conform to the criteria and standards in subsections 38-5(b)(1)-(3). 
b.  All new structures shall be constructed to a height visually compatible with the building and environment with which they are visually related. 
c.  The gross volume of any new structure shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
d.  In the street elevation of a building, the proportion between the width and height in the facade should be visually compatible with the building and environment with which it is visually related. 
e.  The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in the street facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
f.  The rhythm of solids to voids, created by openings in the facade, should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which they are visually related. 
g.  The existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them should be preserved. 
h.  The materials used in the final facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which they are visually related. 
i.  The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
j.  Colors and patterns used on the facade (especially trim) should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which they are visually related. 
k.  The design of the roof should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
l.  The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual building, its occupants and their needs. Further, the landscape treatment should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
m.  The street facade should blend with other buildings via directional expression. When adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or vertical expression, this expression should be carried over and reflected. 
n.  Architectural elements should be incorporated as necessary to relate the new with the old and to preserve and enhance the inherent characteristics of the area. 
(4)  Review and adoption procedure. 
a.  Historic preservation commission. The historic preservation commission shall hold a public hearing when considering the plan for an historic district. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be given by publication as a class 1 notice under Wisconsin Statutes. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing shall also be sent by first class mail by the city clerk to the council member of the aldermanic district or districts in which the historic district is located, and to all the owners of record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of the property within the proposed historic district or are situated in whole or in part within 100 feet of the boundaries of the proposed historic district. Said notice is to be sent at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. Following the public hearing, the historic preservation commission shall vote to recommend, reject, or withhold action on the plan. This recommendation shall be sent to all the owners of record of property within the proposed historic district and to the city plan commission and the common council. 
b.  The city plan commission. The plan commission shall review the historic district plan and make a recommendation to the common council. The plan commission shall make its recommendation on the historic district plan within 45 days.

(7)  The preliminary plat shall be drawn at the scale not more than 100 feet to an inch. The required copies of the preliminary plat shall be made from a black ink line drawing. 
(b)  Streets. 
(1)  General considerations. The streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain features such as streams and existing tree growth, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The preliminary plat shall show topography or be accompanied by a map of the same scale showing topography using contour intervals not greater than five feet. 
(2)  Conform to official map. The arrangement, width and location of all streets shall conform to the official map. 
(3)  Arrangement. 
a.  Major streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of major streets, highways, and thoroughfares. 
b.  Collector streets shall be properly related to the mass transit system, to special traffic generating from facilities such as schools, churches and shopping centers, to population densities, and to the arterial streets into which they feed. 
c.  Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems, and to require the minimum amount of street necessary to provide convenient, safe access to property. The reasonable and intelligent use of curvilinear and cul-de-sac streets is encouraged. 
(4)  Railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the plan commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for park or residential purposes. 
(5)  Highways and thoroughfares. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed highway or thoroughfare, the plan commission may require that the backs of lots abut the highway or thoroughfare and be provided with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, that deep lots with rear service alleys be provided, or that other provisions be made for the adequate protection of properties and the separation of through and local traffic. 
(6)  Width. All streets shall be of the width specified on the official map or, if no width is specified there, they shall be not less than the width specified as follows: 
a.  Highways: 80 feet plus eight-foot tree planting easement. 
b.  Collector streets: 80 feet. 
c.  Minor streets: 70 feet. 
d.  Exceptions: Where a minor residential street, including any proposed extension, does not exceed 1,000 feet in length, a street 60 feet in width with an eight-foot tree planting easement shall be permitted; or when a minor residential street would necessitate lots with depths less than 110 feet, a street 60 feet in width with eight-foot tree planting easements shall be permitted. 
(7)  Alignment and visibility. Clear visibility, measured along the centerline, shall be provided for at least 400 feet on major streets, 350 feet on collector streets, and 250 feet on minor streets. 
(8)  Minimum radii or curvature on the centerline. 
a.  Major streets: 300 feet. 
b.  Collector streets: 200 feet. 
c.  Minor streets: 100 feet. 
(9)  Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on major and collector streets. 
(10)  Street names. Any street which is the reasonable continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. If the topography or other features of a permanent nature are such as to render the continuation of the actual roadway impossible, and where such nomenclature is apt to produce confusion, the street shall not carry the same name as the street to which it may be geometrically aligned. 
Type Dead-end Curving Straight Short Streets Places or Courts Crescent, Way, Circle or Lane Terrace, Row, Lane Long Streets Road or Drive Street or Avenue  
The term "boulevard" shall be reserved for such streets which, because of their breadth or monumental character, are to be especially designated. 
(c)  Intersections. 
(1)  Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and the intersection of more than two streets at one point is discouraged. The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to the minimum possible.

The land on the side of the lots within the area shall be graded by the subdivider and maintained by the abutting property owner to provide for the adequate drainage of surface water. 
(4)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way of sufficient width conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse. Grading or construction adequate for the purpose may be required. Wherever possible, the drainage shall be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow as determined by the plan commission. Such improvement shall be installed prior to council approval of the final plat. 
(5)  A stormwater covenant shall be provided on each plat as follows: The land on the rear of all lots and on the side of lots (specified) within the area shall be graded by the subdivider and maintained by the abutting property owner to provide for the adequate drainage of surface water. 
(6)  An eight-foot tree planting easement shall be provided on the front or side of each lot fronting or siding a major street and streets with a width less than 70 feet, and no portion of the street shall be used for tree planting.

Sec. 46-5. - Public sites and open spaces. 
(a)  Dedication of property unsuitable for development. Whenever a plat is filed of a subdivision containing submarginal land or containing or adjoining an open stream or watercourse, such land shall be dedicated to the city or other appropriate municipality for drainage purposes. Such dedication or reservation shall be made for the purpose of preventing the erection of structures on unsuitable property and to secure the public health and safety and to facilitate adequate provision for drainage. 
(b)  Public open spaces. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section that adequate open spaces may be properly located and preserved as the community develops, and that the cost of providing sites for parks, recreational areas, and all other uses related to the operation of the city government necessary to serve the additional population brought into the community by subdivision development may be most equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional need created by the individual subdivision. 
(2)  Dedication of sites. 
a.  The subdivider shall provide, and dedicate to the public, land compatible with the comprehensive plan for the development of the community, provided that such development shall not exceed in area that provided in subsection (b)(2)b of this section. 
b.  The amount of land to be provided and dedicated in R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 residential districts shall be 4.4 percent of the total nonpublic residential property developed. If dedicated land is set aside in the plat, it shall be done with the approval and in coordination with the city plan commission and the park board. 
(3)  Payment in lieu of dedication. 
a.  Where the plan commission determines that such dedication is not compatible with the comprehensive plan, the subdivider shall, in lieu thereof, pay to the city a fee as determined by resolution of the common council. 
b.  Such fees shall be used only for open space acquisition or the preparation of park and open space plans, including a master plan of development. 
c.  Payment shall be made at the time the building permit is issued. 
d.  No payment shall be required for a parcel on which a permanent residential structure exists prior to the date of the division. However, a residence that is intentionally razed and a new structure built of additional dwellings would come under the provisions of this chapter and be subject to the fees in accordance with subsection (b)(3)a of this section.

The rules, regulations, and sewer rates of the city set forth herein or as amended by the city, shall be considered a part of the contract with every person, company or corporation who is connected to or uses the city sewer system and every such person, company or corporation by connecting with the sewer system shall be considered as expressing his or her or their assent to be bound thereby. Whenever any of such rules and regulations are violated, the use or service may be shut off from the building or place of such violation (even though two or more parties are receiving service through the same connection) and may not be re-established except by order of the common council and on payment of all arrears, the costs, expenses and established charges of shutting off and putting on, and such other terms as the common council may determine, and a satisfactory understanding with the party that no further cause for complaint shall arise. The right is reserved to the common council to change the said rules, regulations, and sewer rates from time to time as they may deem advisable; and to make special rates and contracts in all proper cases. 
    The following rules and regulations for the government of licensed plumbers, sewer users and others, are hereby adopted and established. 
(b)  Plumbers. No plumber, pipe fitter, or other person will be permitted to do any plumbing or pipe fitting work in connection with the sewer system without first receiving a license from the State of Wisconsin and obtaining permission from the building inspection department. All service connections to the sewer main shall comply with state plumbing code. 
(c)  Use of public sewers required. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city's sewer utility, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city's sewer utility, any sewage or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this chapter and the NPDES permit. 
(3)  Except as provided in this section, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage, except where public sewerage is not available and the required permits have been obtained. 
(4)  The owner of all houses, buildings or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located, or may in the future be located, any public sanitary sewer of the city is hereby required, at his or her expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter within 30 days of written notice to do so upon failure to do so, the city may cause such connection to be made and charge the property for such costs as a special charge under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(d)  Watering metering. Public and/or private water systems shall be metered within five days for connecting the lateral system to the sanitary sewer system. The owner shall be responsible for preparing the water piping for meter installation and contacting the city water utility to install the meter. Failure to install the metering will initiate a bill for sewer usage of $50.00 a month from the time of sewer connection. 
(e)  Application for sewer service. 
(1)  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with, or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any sewer main or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the department of public works. 
(2)  Every person desiring to connect to the sewer system shall file an application in writing with the department of public works on such forms as is prescribed for that purpose. The application must state fully and truthfully all the wastes which will be discharged. If the applicant is not the owner of the premises, the written consent of the owner must accompany the application. Person connected to the sewer system of the De Pere Sewer Utility are referred to herein as "users". 
(3)  There shall be two classes of lateral permits: 
a.  For residential and commercial service; and 
b.  For service to establishments producing industrial wastes. 
In either case, the person shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the city. A permit and inspection fee for a lateral permit shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. The industry, as a condition of permit authorization, must provide information describing its wastewater constituents, characteristics and type of facility. 
(4)  A lateral permit will be issued and a sewer connection shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage facilities, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater treatment facilities have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load. 
(5)  If, in the opinion of the city, insufficient reserve capacity exists to adequately and efficiently handle the additional waste loads anticipated from a new industrial connection, such authority may: 
a.  Refuse to issue the sewer permit. 
b.  Require additional time before issuing the permit to increase the capacity of the sewer system so as to possess the capability to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load. 
(6)  If the type or volume of material from industrial property for which a sewer permit was previously granted shall materially and substantially change, the person granted such permit previously shall, upon order of the city: 
a.  Make a new application to the utility in the same manner and form as previously made; 
b.  Cease and desist from such discharge or be subject to disconnection, fine and other penalties provided by this chapter.

(f)  User to keep in repair. All users shall keep their own service pipes in good repair and protected from frost, at their own risk and expense, and shall prevent any unnecessary overburdening of the sewer system. The service pipe shall be defined to be the building drain and lateral pipe extending from the building to the main line sewer. 
(g)  User use only. No user shall allow others or other services to connect to the sewer system through his or her lateral. 
(h)  Vacating of premises and discontinuance of service. Whenever premises served by the system are to be vacated, or whenever any person desires to discontinue service from the system, the city must be notified. Removal of the structure shall include removal of the lateral to the property line and capping of the lateral at the property line. The owner of the premises shall be liable for any damages to the property of the system other than through the fault of the system or its employees, representatives, or agents. 
(i)  User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the city sewer utility or its duly authorized agent, at all reasonable hours of the day, to enter their premises or building to examine the pipes and fixtures, and the manner in which the drains, and sewer connections operate. 
(j)  Construction. 
(1)  Whenever possible, the lateral shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means which is approved by the city. 
(2)  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a lateral or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
(3)  The applicant for the lateral permit shall notify the city when the lateral is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the city or their representative. 
(4)  All excavations for lateral installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
(k)  Installation of house laterals. All service pipes (laterals) on private property will be installed in accordance with the State of Wisconsin Administrative Code, SPS 382. As required by SPS 382, all laterals shall be inspected: "The lateral and/or private interceptor main sewer shall be inspected upon completion of placement of the pipe and before backfilling and tested before or after backfilling." Prior to installation of any service the applicant shall obtain inspection permits from the building/plumbing inspector. 
(l)  Septage acceptance location. No septage shall be discharged to the city's sewerage system. 
(m)  Additional authority. The city may at any time establish specific connection and lateral charges for any main not covered by any other provisions in this chapter. It is further provided that the city may amend or alter any connection or lateral charge after its establishment under the terms of this chapter or previous ordinance or resolution.

(Ord. No. 07-31, § 1, 12-18-2007) 
Sec. 70-6. - Control of industrial and septage wastes. 
(a)  Industrial discharges. Each person discharging other than a "normal" sewage to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of their wastes in accordance with Wisconsin DNR requirements. Similarly, each person desiring to make a new connection to the public sewers for the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged in accordance with said DNR requirements. 
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or proposed to be discharged to the public sewerage system contain substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 70-5 and which, in the judgment of the city, may be detrimental to the sewerage system, the city may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes. 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the sewerage system. 
(3)  Require a control over the quantities and rates of discharge. 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under this article. 
(5)  Require approval from the GBMSD prior to accepting the discharge. 
(b)  Control manholes. 
(1)  Construction. Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall cause to be constructed and maintained one or more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation, measurement, and sampling of wastes, including domestic sewage. 
(2)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing the sewer service and the cost recovery charges for domestic disposal shall be based upon the water consumption of the person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the City of De Pere Water Utility. 
(3)  Provision for deductions. In the event that a person discharging industrial waste into the public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the city that more than ten percent of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the public sewer, then the determination of the water consumption to be used in computing the waste volume discharged into the public sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the city and the industrial waste discharger. 
(c)  Metering of waste. Devices for measuring the volume/strength of waste discharged may be required by the city if this volume/strength cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Where required by the city, metering devices for determining the volume/strength of water shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the city. The cost and expense for all metering shall be paid by the person discharging the wastewater. 
(d)  Waste sampling. 
(1)  Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to inspection and a determination of character and concentration of said wastes on a schedule set by the city. 
(2)  Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment. 
(3)  Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the city or its duly authorized representatives at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken. 
(e)  Pretreatment. When required, in the opinion of the city, to modify or eliminate wastes that are harmful to the structures, processes, or operation of the sewerage system, the discharger shall provide at his or her expense such preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be required to render his or her wastes acceptable for admission to the public sewers. 
(f)  Grease and/or sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided by the industrial discharger and other operations depending on the character of the discharge and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Furthermore, grease interceptors shall be provided by restaurant dischargers. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the discharger shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the city. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the discharger(s) personnel, must be performed by currently licensed disposal firms. 
(g)  Analyses. 
(1)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters or wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 135. Sampling methods, locations, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the city. 
(2)  Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall be made by the city. If the person discharging the waste contests the determination, the discharger may elect to have an independent laboratory determine the character and concentration of the waste. Said independent laboratory shall be certified under NR 149 and shall be acceptable to both the city and the person discharging the waste. All costs incurred by the independent laboratory in making the determination shall be assumed by the discharger or by other agreement with the city. 
(h)  Submission of information. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed flow equalization, pretreatment, or processing facilities shall be submitted for review of the city prior to the start of their construction if the effluent from such facilities is to be discharged into the public sewers. 
(i)  Submission of basic data. Each person who discharges industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the city a report that shall include pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste discharged to the sewerage system. 
Similarly, each person desiring to make a new connection to a public sewer for the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the city a report that shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged. 
(j)  Extension of time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person proposing to discharge a waste, to comply with the time schedule imposed herein, a request for extension of the time may be presented for consideration by the city. 
(Ord. No. 07-31, § 1, 12-18-2007; Ord. No. 13-17, § 15, 8-20-2013)

(Ord. No. 16-12, 7-19-2016) 
Sec. 82-12. - Nicolet Square Recyclable and Garbage Common Collection Service District created created. 
(a)  Purpose. The common council finds that continued city collection of commercial source recyclables and garbage has led to the proliferation of recycling and garbage carts in the city's downtown commercial areas, resulting in access restrictions to businesses and public parking areas and sanitary and aesthetic concerns. Further, commercial building footprints in the historic downtown commercial areas typically encumber the entire parcel, leaving little or no room for public or private refuse container storage or screening, allowing few options to avoid the detrimental impact caused by the presence of individual recycle and garbage carts on collection days or when stored between collection days. 
    Wis. Stats §66.0405 authorizes the city to create district(s) for the collection of refuse defined by type of property. Although both the east and west side commercial business areas exhibit the detrimental impact on aesthetics and access caused by multiple containers on public parking property each collection day, the number of commercial businesses properties contributing to the problem on the east side is far less than on the west side. Further, the configuration of business properties on the west side is compact due to the presence of the Nicolet Square Parking Mall, providing the city an opportunity to implement a novel approach to prevent the deleterious effects the proliferation of recyclable and garbage containers has on the historic downtown commercial properties. The Common Council is mindful that it has not before set apart public property for the purpose of recyclable and garbage collection by a private waste hauler, and wishes to determine the effectiveness of the action prior to expanding the program. 
    Therefore, deeming it prudent to establish one such common collection district at this time to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the collection method, the common council hereby creates the Nicolet Square Recyclable and Garbage collection District ("the Nicolet Square District"). In circumstances where the provisions of this section are in conflict with other sections of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall control. 
(b)  Definitions. When used in this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  Common area means the location(s) identified by the city where it will place dumpster(s) for collecting commercial source recyclables and garbage from the Nicolet Square District. 
(2)  Dumpster means a container designed and used for dumping, receiving and transporting recyclable materials and garbage. In this section, dumpster does not include polycart(s). 
(3)  Nicolet Square District shall mean those real properties abutting Main Ave to the North, Third Street to the East, Reid Street to the South and Fourth Street to the West, in particular the following Parcels: WD-906, WD-907, WD-908, WD-909, WD-910, WD-911, WD-912, WD-913, WD-915, WD-917, WD-918, WD-919, WD-920, WD-921, WD-922, WD-923, WD-925, WD-930 and WD-931, except for those parcels which may have opted out as permitted under §82-12(d)2.

Chapter 102 - HANDICAPPED ACCESS TO CITY FACILITIES, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Cross reference- Streets, alleys and sidewalks, ch. 22; building code, ch. 54. 

Sec. 102-1. - Statement of policy. 
    It is a recognized attribute of our system of government that all citizens be provided access to, and redress of grievances by governing bodies. Access to government includes not only the ability to attend the open meetings of legislative and administrative bodies, but also the opportunity to use local government facilities, participate in local government programs, and be given due consideration for local government employment opportunities without regard to the existence of a handicapping condition. 
(Code 1974, § 29.01) 
Sec. 102-2. - Purpose of chapter. 
    In order that the policy of the city relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of handicap may be effectuated, it is necessary that a procedurally sound, fair and orderly method be established to review, determine and resolve allegations of handicapped discrimination. 
(Code 1974, § 29.02) 
Sec. 102-3. - Review of alleged discriminatory conditions or acts. 
    Any handicapped person, or any person, corporation, association, public or private organization or agency on behalf of a handicapped person, may seek administrative review of any condition or act over which the city has jurisdiction, authority or control which is allegedly discriminatory on the basis of handicap. The following matters shall be reviewable under the procedure set forth in this section: 
(1)  City programs, activities and facilities which are not readily accessible to and usable by the handicapped. 
(2)  The delivery of benefits and services by the city in a manner which may have discriminatory effects on the handicapped. 
(3)  Employment and personal policies and practices which may have discriminatory effects on the handicapped. 
(4)  Contractual arrangements which subject handicapped persons to discrimination. 
(Code 1974, § 29.03) 
Sec. 102-4. - Request for administrative review. 
    Any person allegedly aggrieved by a condition or act which discriminates on the basis of handicap may file a grievance with the office of mayor. The grievance shall state the grounds upon which the person aggrieved contends that discrimination on the basis of handicap has occurred, together with a statement of relief requested. Grievances shall be submitted in written form unless a handicap condition does not permit a person to submit a written document, whereupon an oral grievance shall be accepted. 
(Code 1974, § 29.04) 
Sec. 102-5. - Review procedure. 
(a)  Office of mayor. Upon receipt of a grievance, the office of mayor shall undertake an investigation of the allegations therein contained and make an initial determination with respect to the merits of the grievance and the relief sought. If the office of mayor determines that a grievance has merit, but that alternate methods of relief are appropriate, such alternate relief may be directed. The determination of the office of mayor shall be made in writing within ten working days of the date of receipt of the grievance. 
(b)  Handicap access review committee. If the initial determination by the office of mayor, either as to the issue of merit or relief, is contested by the grievant, the same may be appealed to the handicap access review committee. Such committee shall consist of two members of the common council who serve on the board of public works and two members of the common council who served on the finance committee. Members shall be appointed by the mayor, without confirmation, and shall serve indefinite terms consistent with their membership on the above-mentioned committees. Any member may resign from such appointment, whereupon the mayor shall appoint another member from the appropriate committee of the common council. Appeals shall be filed within ten working days of the date of the written determination of the mayor. The method and procedure for filing an appeal shall be the same as that set forth above for the filing of a grievance, and appeals shall be filed with the office of the city administrator. Upon receipt of a request for an appeal, the handicap access review committee shall set a date not less than three days nor more than 20 days from the date of filing of the appeal, for purposes of conducting a review of the grievance and the initial determination by the office of mayor. Such review shall be informal, and a verbatim record of the proceedings need not be kept. The handicap access review committee shall receive and review all information relevant to the issues raised by the grievant in the initial determination and shall render a decision on appeal in writing within five working days of the close of its meeting. 
(c)  Appeal to the common council. Appeals from the decision of the handicap access review committee shall be to the common council. A request for a hearing before the common council shall be made in the same form and manner as the filing of a grievance, and the same shall be filed with the office of the city administrator within ten working days of the date of the decision of the handicap access review committee. The common council shall schedule a hearing on appeal within 30 days of receipt of the notice of appeal and shall serve notice of such hearing by mail or personal service upon the person requesting such appeal at least 15 days before such hearing. Either party shall have an opportunity to be represented by council or others of their choosing, to present witnesses under oath and to cross examine opposing witnesses under oath, and the opportunity to have a verbatim written transcript made at the initiative and expense of the requesting party. The hearing shall be electronically recorded by the common council. The common council may issue subpoenas at the request of either party. The common council shall render its decision upon appeal, in writing, within five working days of the date of hearing. A copy of such written decision shall be served upon appellant by mail or personal service. 
(d)  Judicial review. The decision of the common council on appeal shall be a final determination and shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Wis. Stats. § 68.13. 
(Code 1974, § 29.05) 
Sec. 102-6. - Election not to be governed by Wis. Stats. ch. 68. 
    The city determines that the appeal procedure set forth in this chapter shall constitute the exclusive method for administrative review of grievances which are the subject of this chapter, and elects not to be governed by the provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 68, except as expressly provided in this chapter.

Sec. 146-3. - Definitions and terminology. 
(a)  Terminology. All terminology used in this article, not defined in subsection (b) of this section, shall be in conformance with applicable publications of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or its successor body. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    ANSI means American National Standards Institute or its successor bodies. 
    A bank level means the total sound level of all sound as measured with a sound level meter using the A-weighted network. The unit of measurement is the dB(A). 
    Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. 
    Construction means any safe preparation, assembly, erection, substantial repair, alteration or similar action, but excluding demolition, for or of public or private rights-of-way, structures, utilities or similar property. 
    Cycle means a complete sequence of values of a periodic quantity that occur during a period. 
    Day or daytime means the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
    Decibel means a standard unit for measuring sound pressure levels that is equal to one-tenth of a bel and is a unit of level when the base of the logarithm is the tenth root of ten, and the quantities concerned are proportional to power; abbreviated "dB." 
    Demolition means any dismantling, intentional destruction or removal of structures, utilities, public or private right-of-way surfaces or similar property. 
    Emergency means any occurrence or set of circumstances involving actual or imminent physical trauma or property damage which demands immediate action. 
    Emergency work means any work performed for the purpose of preventing or alleviating the physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an emergency. 
    Fluctuating sound means a sound whose sound pressure level varies significantly but does not equal the ambient environmental level more than once during the period of observation. 
    Frequency means the reciprocal of the primitive period of a function periodic in time. The unit is the cycle per unit time and must be specified; typically this unit will be Hertz (Hz) i.e. cycles per second. 
    Impulsive sound means an impulsive sound is characterized by brief excursions of sound pressure (acoustic impulses) which significantly exceed the ambient environmental sound pressure. The duration of a single impulse is usually less than one second. 
    Intermittent sound means an intermittent sound is a sound which sound pressure level equals the ambient environmental level two or more times during the period of observations. The period of time during which the level of the sound remains at an essentially constant value different from that of the ambient is on the order of one second or more. 
    Lot-line means an imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions. 
    Microbar means a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics that is equal to one dyne per square centimeter. 
    Nonsteady sound means a sound whose level shifts significantly during the period of observation. 
    Period means the smallest increment of time for which a function repeats itself in a periodic quantity. 
    Period of observation means the period of observation is the time interval during which acoustical data are obtained. The term "period of observation" is determined by the characteristics of the sound being measured and should also be at least ten times as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the variance in indicated sound level, the longer must be the observation time for a given expected accuracy of the measurement. 
    Periodic quantity means an oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time. 
    Person means any person, person's firm, association, copartnership, joint venture, corporation or any entity public or private in nature. 
    Public right-of-way means any street, avenue, boulevard, highway, sidewalk or alley or similar place which is owned or controlled by a governmental entity. 
    Pure tone means a sound having a single frequency. 
    Sound means an oscillation in pressure, particle displacement, particle velocity or other physical parameter, in a medium with internal forces that causes compression and rarefaction of that medium. The description of sound may include any characteristic of such sound, including duration, intensity and frequency. 
    Sound analyzer means a device for measuring the band pressure level or pressure spectrum level of a sound as a function of frequency. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighing networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner. 
    Sound pressure level means the sound pressure level, in decibels of sound, is 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure, which reference pressure must be explicitly stated. 
    Spectrum means a spectrum is a function of time and is a description of its resolution into components, each of different frequency and usually of different amplitude and phase and is also used to signify a continuous range of components each of different frequency and usually of different amplitude and phase. A spectrum is used to signify a continuous range of components usually wide in extent within which waves have some specified characteristics such as audio-frequency spectrum and is also applied to functions of variables other than time. 
    Steady sound means a sound whose level remains essentially constant (i.e., fluctuations are negligibly small) during the period of observation.

Sec. 146-7. - Variances for time to comply. 
Time to comply. 
(1)  It is recognized that it may not be technically or economically feasible for certain commercial or industrial sources of sound to be modified in such a manner as to comply in a timely manner with the standards set forth in this article. Therefore, the board of health may issue a variance permit on existing or potential commercial or industrial sources of sound which produce excessive noise. 
(2)  At least 60 days prior to commencement of sound producing operations, or upon a complaint which cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of health officer, the owner, or authorized agent of any commercial or industrial source or potential source of sound may apply to the board of health for a variance in time to comply with the noise level requirements of this article. The board of health shall have the authority, consistent with this section, to grant a variance, not to exceed 18 months from the effective date of such variance permit. 
(3)  Any person seeking a variance as allowed herein shall file an application with the health officer. The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity for which the variance is sought into compliance with this article would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. A public hearing shall be held, proceeded by a Class 1 notice of such hearing. Notice of the public hearing on the variance request shall be given to all property owners within a 300-foot radius of the property for which the variance is sought. At the public hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(4)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the board of health shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the variance against the adverse impact on health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the variance. Applicants for variances and persons contesting the variances may be required to submit any information the board of health may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the board of health shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the variance in time to comply. 
(5)  Variances shall be granted to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a schedule for achieving compliance. The variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the variance shall terminate the variance and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this article for which the variance was granted. 
(6)  Application for extension of the variance or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial variances under this subsection, except that the board of health must find that the need for the extension or modification clearly outweighs any adverse impacts of granting the extension or modification. 
(Ord. No. 10-06, § 1, 4-7-2010) 
Sec. 146-8. - Lot line noise regulation. 
(a)  The following noise limitations are established for any premises, measured at the lot line:

Sec. 146-11. - Neighborhood quiet zones. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to create, assist in creating, permit, or continue to permit the continuation of any unreasonably loud, disturbing or unnecessary noise emanating from within residential neighborhood quiet zones, as established by the common council, between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., such as produces annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt to any person, or to the enjoyment of property or comfort of any person, or affects the safety, health or morals of the public. 
(b)  As used in this subsection, the phrase "neighborhood quiet zones" shall be defined as a residential area wherein not less than 51 percent of the property owners in a nonbusiness zoned area have successfully petitioned the common council to request such status. In arriving at the requisite percentage, each parcel of property or tax parcel shall be counted as one. The majority of record title holders to each property must sign the petition in order to constitute one parcel toward the requisite number of residents. Posting of such zones shall be in accordance with the procedures as established by the common council. The area shall not be less than one block in length on both sides of the street provided, however, smaller residential areas may be included within an existing contiguous quiet zone. A separate petition shall be filed for each block, or portion thereof, or, in the case of a lawfully established neighborhood association, the boundaries of such association. When the petition is filed with the city clerk, it shall contain the requisite percentage of owners and no signatures can be added or subtracted after it is filed with the city clerk. All signatures on the petition shall be obtained within three months from the date of the first signature or such petition shall be void. The common council shall not grant such status to any area less than that as prescribed above. Such status shall remain in effect for a period of at least one year, after which time, utilizing the same guidelines as for the establishment of such status, it may be repealed by petition of the residents or owners subject to approval of the common council. Notice of public hearings to establish or repeal any residential neighborhood quiet zone shall be given to all record owners within the zone. A fee as determined by resolution of the common council shall accompany each petition.
