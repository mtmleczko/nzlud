FOREWORD
We are pleased to provide this new Code of Ordinances for the City of Neillsville, Wisconsin. This
codification provides a complete revision and codification of all Ordinances of a general and
permanent nature of the City. All amended Ordinances are brought up to date. The Code also
includes certain new Ordinances that were prepared to fill gaps not covered by existing Ordinances.
The Code also includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles
follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this
order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult
the alphabetical index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-bysection
analysis of the articles within the chapter.
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from the
text but are covered by Title 1 of the Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the
text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate.
Various editorial notes, state law references and amendment notes have been included throughout the
Code to clarify its provisions.
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the City officials in the
preparation of this Code.

OPEN MEETING LAW GUIDE
General Requirements
1. Wisconsin's Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental bodies shall be
open to all citizens at all times. Sec. 19.81(2), Wis. Stats.
2. Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in places reasonably
accessible to the public.
3. Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically provided otherwise by law.
4. When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to compose a quorum, that
meeting is presumed to be convened for the purpose of conducting official business. Such a
meeting is in violation of The Open Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the
meeting is not open to the public. Sec. 19.82(2), Wis. Stats.
Public Notice
1. WHO MUST RECEIVE NOTICE. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her designee,
shall give notice to the official newspaper and to any other members of the news media who
have filed a written request to receive such notices, or if neither exists, in a manner likely to
give notice to the public. Notice must also be given as required by any other state statutes.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF NOTICE. The notice for the meeting shall include:
(a) the time, date and place of the meeting, and
(b) the subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered
in closed session.
The governmental body may discuss, and if urgent, act upon matters which were not
specifically referred to in the agenda where the agenda contains a general item, such as
"miscellaneous business." Where the presiding officer has specific knowledge that matters may
come before the body, they should be included on the agenda.
3. TIME FOR NOTICE. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
commencement of the meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible or impractical,
in which shorter notice may be given. In no case may notice be provided less than two (2)
hours in advance of the meeting. Sec. 19.84(3) Wis. Stats.
4. COMMITTEES AND SUBUNITS EXEMPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. A legally
constituted subunit of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of
the governing body's meeting or immediately after the lawful meeting to act or deliberate upon
a matter which was the subject of that meeting. For this exemption to apply, the presiding
officer must publicly announce the time, place and subject matter of the subunit's meeting in
advance at the meeting of the governing body.
Procedure for Closed Sessions.
(1) Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee knows that a closed
session is being contemplated. Notice is required regardless of whether a majority of members
will or will not support going into closed session at the meeting. Sec. 19.84(2), Wis. Stats.
(2) After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, or motion made and recorded, supported
by majority vote, is required to close, with the vote of each member recorded in the minutes.
Sec. 19.85(1), Wis. Stats.
(3) If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall announce to those
present at the meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the nature of the business to be
considered in the closed session and the specific exemption(s) relied upon in Sec. 19.85, Wis.
Stats., under which the closed session is permitted.
(4) Only matters contained in the presiding officer's announcement of the closed session may be
considered during the closed session.
(5) An open session, with adequate notice, must precede a closed session, even where it was
decided at a prior open session to go into a closed session at a subsequent meeting.
(6) A governmental body may vote to go into closed session at a properly convened open session,
for a permitted purpose, where specific notice of intent to consider going into closed session
was not included on the agenda at the time notice of the open session was given. However,
such procedure requires that the presiding officer or his/her designee did not contemplate or
have knowledge that any of the other members contemplated, a closed session at the time notice
of the agenda was given.
Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions.
(1) Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., creates an exemption for governmental bodies deliberating after
quasi-judicial trials or hearings. However, boards of review cannot rely on this exemption, for
Sec. 70.47(2m), Wis. Stats., requires all board of review meetings to be held in open session.
(2) Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law allowing the use
of a closed session when a governmental body is considering the demotion, dismissal,
licensing, discipline or tenure of a public employee or a person licensed by a board or
commission. This exception permits preliminary discussion and investigation without the
necessity of providing actual notice to the individual involved. However, before any
evidentiary hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must be given to the person
involved so that he or she can exercise his or her right to request an open session for those
purposes.
(3) Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., sanctions the use of closed sessions where governmental bodies
are considering employment, promotion, compensation or performance evaluation of any public
employee. Governmental bodies should exercise caution when considering performance to
avoid discussing matters that are covered by Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats.
(4) Sec. 19.85(1)(d), Wis. Stats., permits the use of a closed sessions when applications for parole
or probation are being considered, or when crime detection or prevention strategy is to be
discussed.
(5) Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., allows closed sessions for the purpose of deliberating or
negotiating the purchase of public properties, the investing of public funds, or the conducting
of other specified public business, as long as competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed
session. Under this exception, a governmental body could meet in closed session for the
purpose of forming negotiation strategies, although the body must give notice that an open
session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to convene in closed session for the
purpose of discussing labor negotiation strategies.
(6) Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social or personal
histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if conducted in public, would have a
"substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to" may be held in closed
session under Sec. 19.85(1)(f), Wis. Stats. However, this exemption is unavailable where Sec.
19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is applicable.
(7) Sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., allows a governmental body to confer with its legal counsel in
closed session for the purpose of obtaining oral or written advice concerning strategy to be
adopted by the body with respect to present and prospective litigation directly involving the
governmental body.
(8) Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for confidential
written advice from ethics boards under Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats.
Limitations on Closed Sessions.
(1) Sec. 19.85(2), Wis. Stats., makes it impermissible for a governmental body to reconvene in
open session within twelve (12) hours after a closed session, unless public notice of the
subsequent open session was given at the same time and in the same manner as was required
for the original open session.
(2) Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required to be in open
session under Sec. 19.85(3), Wis. Stats. However, a governmental body can vote to
preliminarily approve bargaining proposals in closed session, in order to reach a consensus, as
long as final ratification occurs in open session.
Ballots, Votes and Records.
(1) Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a governmental body
to determine any election or decision, except the election of the officers of such body. This
narrow exception does not permit use of secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers
of the governmental units such as department heads, or fill vacancies on the body itself.
(2) Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote.
(3) Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public inspection.
Use of Equipment in Meetings.
(1) A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media's equipment.
(2) Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided that the use
of this equipment does not interfere with the conduct of the meeting(s).
(3) A member of a governmental body does not have the right to tape record a closed session of
the board.

purpose and intent of this section and to the objectives and design criteria of the

payment of all or any part of the cost of the work or improvement.
(b) The amount assessed against any property for any work or improvement which does not

State Law Reference: Section 66.62, Wis. Stats.
SEC. 2-6-2 RESOLUTION AND REPORT REQUIRED.

preliminary resolution its intention to exercise such powers for a stated municipal purpose.
Such resolution shall describe generally the contemplated purpose, the limits of the proposed
assessment district, the number of installments in which the special assessments may be paid
or that the number of installments will be determined at the hearing required under Section
2-6-5 of this Chapter and direct the proper municipal officer or employee to make a report
thereon. Such resolution may limit the proportion of the cost to be assessed.
(b) The report required by Subsection (a) shall consist of:
(1) Preliminary or final plans and specifications.
(2) An estimate of the entire cost of the proposed work or improvement.

for any such proposed work or improvement shall be apportioned among the individual parcels in
the manner designated by the Common Council.

water main laid in one of the streets upon which it abuts, shall be entitled to such deduction
or exemption as the Common Council determines to be reasonable and just under the
circumstances of each case, when a special assessment is levied for the sanitary sewer or
water main laid in the other street upon which such corner lot abuts. Under any circumstance
the assessment will not be less than the long way of such lot. The Common Council

change the plans and specifications so as to accomplish a fair and equitable assessment.

commenced or completed prior to the filing of the report or prior to the hearing, then
the Common Council shall by resolution confirm the report as made or modified and
provide for payment in whole or in part by assessment.
(d) The Clerk-Treasurer shall publish the final resolutions as required in Section 2-6-5 of this
Chapter.

appeal by Section 66.60(12), Wisconsin Statutes, or any other applicable provision of law.
SEC. 2-6-7 COMBINED ASSESSMENTS.
If more than a single improvement is undertaken, the Common Council may combine the
assessments as a single assessment on each property affected except that the property owner may
object to any one or more of said improvements.
SEC. 2-6-8 COUNCIL'S POWER TO AMEND, CANCEL OR CONFIRM SPECIAL
ASSESSMENT.
If after completion or after the receipt of bids, the actual cost of any work or improvement is
found to vary materially from the original estimate, or the assessment is void or invalid for any

giving notice as required in Section 2-6-5 to amend, cancel or confirm any prior assessment and
notice of this amending, canceling or confirming be given by the Clerk-Treasurer as provided in
Section 2-6-6 of this chapter.

Special Assessments
SEC. 2-6-11 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT A LIEN ON PROPERTY.
Pursuant to subsection (13) of Section 66.60, Wisconsin Statutes, any special assessment
levied under this chapter shall be a lien on the property against which it is levied on behalf of the
City of Neillsville. The Common Council shall provide for the collection of such assessments and
may establish penalties for payment after the due date. The Common Council shall provide that all
assessments not paid by the date specified shall be extended upon the tax roll as a delinquent tax

Such may include snow and ice removal, weed elimination, street sprinkling oiling or
tarring, repair of sidewalks or curb and gutter, garbage and refuse disposal, sewer service
and tree care or removal. The provision for notice of such charges shall be optional with the

(3) places in the City and a copy of such notice mailed to every interested person whose post

shall specify that on a certain date a hearing will be held by the Common Council as to
whether the service in question shall be performed.
(b) Such special charges shall not be payable in installments. If not paid within the period fixed
by the Common Council, such delinquent charge shall become a lien as provided in Section

cost of any work or improvement upon the property benefited if notice and hearing is waived
in writing by property owners affected.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or this or other ordinance or resolution, it is
specifically intended and provided by this ordinance that the City of Neillsville may levy

or easily damaged.
(f) A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as
follows:
(1) The cost of photocopying shall be $ .25 per page, excluding accident reports. Said

Public Records
requests for records, or obtain copies of records, and the costs thereof. This subsection does
not apply to members of the Common Council.
SEC. 2-7-5 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be
deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested.
However, a request for a record without reasonable limitation as to subject matter
or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A
request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request
may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to
state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received
by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2-7-4(f)(6). A requester may
be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a
private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay,
either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the
request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring
with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time
consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request
in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2-7-6. If a request is made
orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the
reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral
denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written
statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall
inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination
is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under sec. 19.37(1), Wis.
Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
SEC. 2-7-6 LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS.
(a) As provided by sec. 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt from inspection
under this Chapter.
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized
to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement
purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if
exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state;
(3) Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or
the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection;
and
(4) Pursuant to sec. 905.08, Wis. Stats., a record or any portion of a record containing
information qualifying as a common law trade secret. "Trade secrets" are defined as
unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plans, appliances, formulas, or processes,
which are used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles,
materials or information which are obtained from a person and which are generally
recognized as confidential.
Public Records
(b) As provided by sec. 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records are exempt from
inspection under this section.
(c) In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically
exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, may
deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public
interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the
request record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are
not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and
given in order to obtain the information contained in them.
(2) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations after a
quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(b) and (c), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations
concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance,
or discipline or any City officer or employe, or the investigation of charges
against a City officer or employe, unless such officer or employe consents to such
disclosure.
(4) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(d), Wis. Stats., records concerning current strategy for
crime detection or prevention.
(5) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations or negotiations
on the purchase of City property, investing of City funds, or other City business
whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.
(6) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(f), Wis. Stats., financial, medical, social or personal
histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely
to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in
such history or data.
(7) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., communications between legal counsel for
the City and any officer, agent or employe of the City, when advice is being rendered
concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the City or any of its
officers, agents or employes is or is likely to become involved, or communications
which are privileged under sec. 905.03, Wis. Stats.
(8) Pursuant to sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats., request for confidential written advice from
an ethics board, and records of advice given by such ethics board on such requests.
(d) If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be
made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made
public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before
release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record
and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material.
If in the judgement of the custodian and the City Attorney there is no feasible way to
separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing
nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

legal custodians and which are considered obsolete, after completion of any required audit

rubbish or dirt. If such owner or occupant shall refuse or fail to remove any such rubbish or dirt when
notified to do so by the Common Council, the Council may cause the same to be done and report the
cost thereof to the City Clerk-Treasurer who shall spread the cost on the tax roll as a special tax
against the premises, or such cost may be recovered in an action against the owner or occupant.
SEC. 4-2-2 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR.
(a) OWNER TO CONSTRUCT. It shall be the duty of the abutting owner to build, repair,
construct and perpetually maintain sidewalks along or upon any street, alley or highway in the
City of Neillsville and to pay the entire cost of construction thereof. Whenever the Common
Council shall by resolution determine that a sidewalk be laid, rebuilt, repaired, lowered or
raised along or upon any public street, alley or highway within the City of Neillsville, it shall
proceed according to Section 66.615 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Sidewalks shall be located in
such places as designated by the Common Council.
(b) PERMIT REQUIRED. No person shall hereafter lay, remove, replace or repair any public
sidewalk within the City of Neillsville unless he is under contract with the City to do such work
or has obtained a permit therefor from the Common Council at least seven (7) days before work
is proposed to be undertaken. No fee shall be charged for such permits.
(c) SPECIFICATIONS. All sidewalks within the City of Neillsville hereafter shall be repaired,
rebuilt and constructed in accordance with the following specifications:
(1) Subgrade. The subgrade shall be prepared by excavating to the line, grade and cross
section as established by the City Engineer and approved by the Common Council.
Soft and unsuitable material shall be removed and replaced with sand or other
satisfactory material, and the subgrade shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted
and moistened immediately before the concrete is placed. When so specified by the
Common Council, a sub-base of sand, sand and gravel or other approved porous
material shall be placed under the sidewalk. On embankments the subgrade shall
extend at least one (1) foot beyond each edge of the sidewalk.
Street and Sidewalks
(2) Material. All sidewalks shall be of air entrained concrete composed of six (6) bags per
cubic yard of one course construction, and built to the established line and grade.
Gravel shall be of good quality. Concrete shall be mixed thoroughly for a minimum
of one minute after all materials have been placed in the mixer.
(3) a. Forms. Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or metal of sufficient
strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement during the process of
depositing and consolidating the concrete. Wood forms shall be surfaced plank
of at least two (2) inches thickness except for sharply curved sections. Metal
forms shall be of approved section. The forms shall be of full depth of the
required walk and shall be of such design as to permit secure fastening. Forms
shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled before the concrete is placed against them.
Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade, deposited just above
the finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to
the surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level with the
top of the forms and finished with wooden flats.
b. To provide adequate drainage, the sidewalk shall slope toward the curb at a
minimum rate of one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot of width of sidewalk. All joints
and edges shall be finished with a one-fourth (1/4) inch radius edging tool.
Sidewalks shall be constructed within the limits of the street, and unless otherwise
specifically indicated, there shall be one foot strip of street property left between
the property line and the edge of the sidewalk.
(4) Width and Thickness. Residential walks shall be five (5) feet in width and not less
than four (4) inches thick except within driveway approaches where the minimum
thickness shall be six (6) inches; provided that walks in residential areas may be
repaired or replaced to a width not less than the existing width on the effective date of
this Section. Sidewalks in front of commercial or industrial establishments shall be not
less than eight (8) feet in width and five (5) inches in thickness except within driveway
approaches where the minimum thickness shall be seven (7) inches.
(5) Finishing. Before the last finish has set, the sidewalk shall be steel troweled and
brushed in transverse direction. Before the final finishing, the surface shall be checked
with a ten (10) foot straight edge and any areas departing more than one-eighth (1/8)
inch from the testing edge shall be corrected by adding or removing concrete while the
concrete in the walk is still plastic.
(6) Jointing. Transverse, full depth, one-half (1/2) inch thick expansion joints of
premolded expansion material shall be located every forty feet and at the property line,
and where the walk intersects another walk, curb line, building or driveway approach,
and at buildings, walls, poles and stop boxes. The expansion joint material shall be
placed in a neat and workmanlike manner with its upper edge slightly below the
finished sidewalk surface. Dummy groove joints for controlled cracking, at least threeeighths
(3/8) inch in thickness and five-sixteenths (5/16) inch in depth, shall be placed
at intervals of approximately four (4) feet. All joints shall be at right angles to the
direction and grade of the walk. Diagonal joints may be used only when approved by
the Common Council.
(7) Curbing and Drying. As soon as any of the concrete work hereinbefore mentioned has
been finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive marring of the surface, it
shall be cured and protected against rapid drying. Failure to comply with this requirement
shall be deemed sufficient cause of suspension of the work. Curing shall be
accomplished by the "Impervious Coating," "Wet Fabric" or "Paper" methods. For
impervious coating or membrane curing, only those materials meeting requirements
of ASTM Specs. C156-44T, "Method of Test for Efficiency of Materials for Curing
Street and Sidewalks
Concrete"shall be used. Said specifications are hereby adopted by reference as if fully
set forth herein. Walks shall be kept free from all traffic at normal temperatures for
forty-eight (48) hours and in cold weather (below 50 degrees F.) for ninety-six (96)
hours. No concrete shall be poured when the temperature may be expected to fall
below 35 degrees F. in any seventy-two (72) hour period or upon frozen subgrade.
(d) SIDEWALK REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. Pursuant to Sec. 66.615, Wis. Stats., the
Common Council may order property owners to repair or remove and replace any sidewalk
which is unsafe, defective or insufficient. If the property owner shall fail to so repair or remove
and replace such sidewalk for a period of twenty (20) days after service of the notice provided
in Sec. 66.615(3)(c), Wis. Stats., the Common Council shall repair or construct such sidewalk
and the Clerk-Treasurer shall enter the total cost thereof upon the tax roll as a special tax
against said lot or parcel of land.
(e) UNSAFE SIDEWALKS. The Common Council may at any time, by ordinance or resolution,
order any sidewalk which is unsafe, defective, or insufficient, to be removed and replaced with
a sidewalk in accordance with the standard specifications provided for in this Section.
(f) CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. All work for the construction of sidewalks shall be let by
contract to the lowest responsible bidder unless otherwise provided. Whenever the cost of
repairs of any sidewalk in front of any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed Twenty-five ($
25.00) Dollars, the Common Council may have City employees make immediate repairs,
without notice or letting the work by contract, and charge the cost thereof to the owner of such
lot or parcel of land, in the manner provided in this Section.

by leakage of defective pipes and fixtures. If a consumer fails to repair a leaky or broken service pipe
from curb to point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the Superintendent
of the Utility after notification has been served on the consumer by the Superintendent, the water will
be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed.
Water Utility
SEC. 5-1-4 REPAIRS TO MAINS.
The Utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily, to make repairs,
alterations or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit of sufficient delay,
the company will give notification by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of
the supply. No rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for such temporary suspension of
supply.
SEC. 5-1-5 REPAIRS TO METERS.
(a) Meters will be repaired by the Water Utility and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary
wear and tear will be borne by the Utility.
(b) Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises,
his agent or tenant, or from the negligence of any one of them to properly secure and protect
same, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or
to be injured from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the
customer or the owner of the premises.
SEC. 5-1-6 SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF BILLS; UNPAID BILLS TO BE A LIEN
AGAINST THE PROPERTY.
If bills are not paid within the period allotted for such payment, a penalty of five (5%) percent
shall be added to said charge and the same shall constitute a lien on the property served or to which
service is available and shall be added to the City's tax roll as provided in the Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC. 5-1-7 FAILURE TO READ METERS.
(a) Where the Utility is unable to read meter after two successive trials, the fact shall be plainly
indicated upon the bill, the minimum charge assessed, and the difference adjusted with the
consumer when the meter is read again; that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will
be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and the
credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding billing
period.
(b) If the meter is damaged (see Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to operate for any reason, the
Utility will render a bill for the current period, based on an average of the last two (2) billing
periods, providing there is no particular reason why the use during that period has not been
normal. In case the last two periods cannot be properly used, then the bill shall be estimated
by some equitable method.
(c) Section 196.171 of the Wisconsin Statutes which provides that consumers who fail to allow
Utility agents to read or inspect meters at reasonable hours or who refuse or fail to permit
authorized utility personnel to read the meter at least once every six (6) months where the utility
bills are monthly or bimonthly, or at least once every nine (9) months where the utility bills are
quarterly or less frequently than quarterly, shall be subject to a forfeiture of Twenty-five
($25.00) Dollars for each offense, is hereby adopted by reference.
SEC. 5-1-8 CHARGES FOR WATER WASTED DUE TO LEAKS.
When the meter registers losses due to pipe leaks, the Utility shall determine whether or not the
defect in the piping or equipment was known to the consumer or, being known, he had used his best
efforts to correct the condition. If the Utility is satisfied that the loss occurred without the consumer's
knowledge, or having known about it he had tried to correct the condition, the Utility may determine
as nearly as possible what the amount of the loss is by comparison with the use of the water during
a like period, and the excess may be billed at the lowest step in the rates. If, however, the consumer
Water Utility
knew of the leak and failed to give proper attention to it, the Utility will bill for the total consumption
shown by the meter at regular rates.
SEC. 5-1-9 SURREPTITIOUS USE OF WATER.
When the Utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining his supply of water, in
whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering
of the Utility service being delivered to his equipment, the Utility reserves the right to estimate
andpresent immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such interference and such bill shall
be payable subject to a twenty-four (24) hour disconnection of service. When the Utility shall have
disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the Utility will reconnect the consumer upon the
following conditions:
(a) The consumer will be required to deposit with the Utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the
payment of the consumer's bills for utility service to the Utility.
(b) The consumer will be required to pay the Utility for any and all damages to its equipment on
the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering.
(c) The consumer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the Utility
against further losses.
SEC. 5-1-10 WATER FOR CONSTRUCTION.

or tank wagon to be filled.
(b) Payment for the water for construction shall be made in advance at the scheduled rates. The
service pipe must be carried inside the cellar wall from where the water must be drawn. No
connection with the service pipe at the curb shall be made without special permission from the
Superintendent.
SEC. 5-1-11 USE OF HYDRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION.
(a) In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the Superintendent
to use a hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until it is equipped with a sprinkling valve. A
charge will be made for setting a valve, or for moving it from one hydrant to another. In no
case shall any valve be moved except by a member of the Water Utility.
(b) Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for water to be used at the
scheduled rates. The applicant must make a deposit for the hydrant wheel
and for the reducer, if he desires one. When the contractor has finished using the hydrant, he
must notify the Water Department to that effect. The charge for the use of water from a hydrant
will be determined in accordance with scheduled rates.
SEC. 5-1-12 EMERGENCY AND OCCASIONAL SERVICE.
(a) Water used for construction work must be covered by a written permit which can be obtained
only from the Superintendent. In no case will any employee of the Utility turn on water for
construction work unless the contractor first presents a permit. Upon completion of the
construction work the contractor must return the original permit to the Water Utility together
with a statement of the actual amount of construction work performed.
(b) Consumers shall not allow contractors, masons or other persons to take water from their
premises without first showing a permit from the Department. Any consumer failing to comply
Water Utility
with this provision will have his water service discontinued. He shall be subject to the general
penalty provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
SEC. 5-1-13 OPERATION OF VALVES AND HYDRANTS; PENALTY.
Any person who shall, without authority of the Superintendent, operate any valve connected with
the street or supply mains, or open any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for
the purpose of extinguishing fire, or who shall want only to injure or impair the same shall be subject
to a fine of not less than Ten ($10.00) Dollars nor more than One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars. Permits
for the use of hydrants for filling sprinkling carts apply only to such hydrants as are designated for such
use. Owners or operators of motor vehicles will be held for the cost of repair of any hydrant damaged
by being hit by a motor vehicle, and the Water Utility will not be responsible for the damage to the
motor vehicle by reason of such accident.
SEC. 5-1-14 HYDRANT CONNECTIONS.
In the use of a fire hydrant supply, the hydrant valve will be set at the proper opening by the
Water Utility when the sprinkling valve is set and the flow of water must be regulated by means of the
sprinkling valve. If the water is to be used through iron pipe connections, all such pipe installations
shall have a swing joint to facilitate quick disconnection from the fire hydrant.
SEC. 5-1-15 RIGHT TO OPEN HYDRANTS.
Only such persons as shall be authorized by the Superintendent of the Water Utility or

taps at least once every twelve (12) months for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of
water.
SEC. 5-1-17 VACATION OF PREMISES.
When premises are to be vacated, the Utility shall be notified in writing at once, so that it may
remove the meter and shut off the supply at the curb cock. The owner of the premises shall be liable
to prosecution for any damage to the property of the Water Department by reason of failure to notify
the Utility of vacancy.

inches in length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

as defined in subsection (b) above to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him

certainty that any public nuisance as defined in subsection (b) above exists, he/she shall

Common Council. Notice under this section shall be by regular mail to the owner and/or
occupant at the address on file at the City Clerk's office as well as posting on the property.
(f) ASSESSMENT OF COSTS OF ABATEMENT. The entire cost of abating any public nuisance

dimensions of a building or structure (interior or exterior), including but not limited to,
construction or demolition of any walls, construction of a deck, adding a new room,
constructing a new storage shed, building a garage or installing a new central heating or
central air conditioning system. Construction or installation actions shall be considered
by the Building Inspector an alteration if they substantially increase the value of the
property in excess of One Thousand dollars ($1,000). Demolition of a significant portion
of a building or structure shall be considered an alteration and shall require a Building
Permit. With alteration, a Building Permit is required, unless exempt under (b)(2).

issued to the owner, or his agent, until said fees are paid.

by the City to the cost of a Building Permit (Commerial or Residential) if the City
exercises its option of having its contracted engineering firm review any construction
projects prior to issuance of a Building Permit.
(2) Any building or structure that costs or that will cost in labor and materials for alteration
or demolition actions less than One Thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be exempt from the
Building Permit requirement if the owner, occupant or agent of the owner or occupant
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector that the total cost of material
and labor is or will total under One Thousand dollars ($1,000). For evaluation of the
total expenditures, the cost of the materials will be presumed to equal the cost of labor.
For example, if the applicant expends Five Hundred dollars ($500) on materials then the
labor cost is presumed to be Five Hundred dollars ($500) regardless of the person or
persons that perform the work. If the Building Inspector is not satisfied that the work is
or will total less than One Thousand dollars ($1,000), the Building Inspector may require

general requirements affecting the proposed development. A sketch of the proposed
subdivision drawn on a topographic survey map should be submitted. The subdivider
shall also submit a location map showing the relationship of the proposed subdivisions
to traffic arteries and existing community facilities.
(2) Preliminary Plat.
a. The subdivider shall submit to the Common Council and to those agencies having
the authority to object to plats under provisions in Chapter 236 of the Wisconsin
Statutes, a preliminary plat based upon an accurate exterior boundary survey by a
registered land surveyor which shall show clearly the proposed subdivision at a scale
of not more than one inch per 100 feet having two-foot contour intervals, shall
identify the improvements (grading, tree planting, paving, installation of facilities
and dedications of land), easements which the subdivider proposes to make and shall
indicate by accompanying letter when the improvements will be provided. Any
proposed restrictive covenants for the land involved shall be submitted.
b. The Planning Commission and Common Council may submit a copy of the
preliminary plat to the City Engineer and Land Planning Consultant for review and
written report of their reaction to the proposed plat.
c. After review of the preliminary plat and negotiations with the subdivider on changes
being advisable and the kind and extent of public improvements which will be
required, the Common Council shall reject or approve conditionally the preliminary
plat within forty (40) days, as provided by statute. The subdivider shall be informed
of any conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection. Failure of the Common
Council to act within forty (40) days shall constitute approval of the preliminary plat
unless other authorized agencies object to the plat.
d. Approval of the preliminary plat shall entitle the subdivider to final approval of the
layout shown by such plat, provided the final plat conforms substantially to such
layout and conditions of approval have been met.
Subdivisions
(3) Final Plat.
a. Final Plats shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and Common Council
within six (6) months of preliminary plat acceptance unless this requirement is
waived in writing by the Common Council.
b. The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and to the
requirements of all applicable ordinances and state laws and shall be submitted for
certification of those agencies having the authority to object to the plat as provided
by Section 236.12(2), Wisconsin Statutes.
c. The final plat shall be accompanied by detailed construction plans of all improvements.
d. The final plat shall be presented to the Common Council at least ten (10) work days
prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered and shall be accepted or rejected
by the Common Council within sixty (60) days of its submission, unless the time is
extended by an agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated
in the minutes of the Common Council meeting and a copy thereof or a written
statement of such reasons supplied to the subdivider. It the Common Council fails
to act within sixty (60) days and the time has not been extended by agreement and
if no unsatisfied objections have been filed within that period, the plat as certified
by all necessary officials, the plat shall be recorded in accordance with the
requirements of the Wisconsin Statutes. The plat shall be recorded prior to the time
that lots are offered for sale, reference is made to the map for sales purposes, or use
is made of lot and block numbers on the plat.
e. If the original of the final plat has been filed with another approving authority, the
subdivider may file a true copy of such plat in lieu of the original. However, before
approval of the Planning Commission and Common Council will be inscribed on the
original of the final plat, the surveyor or subdivider shall certify the respects in
which the original of the final plat differs from the true copy and all modifications
must first be approved.
(b) MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
(1) Certified Survey Required. When it is proposed to divide land into two parcels or
building sites, any one of which is less than five acres, or when it is proposed to divide
a block, lot or outlot into not more than two parcels or building sites within a recorded

held under the escrow agreement or performance bond shall be turned over and delivered
to the City and applied to the cost of the required improvements. Any balance remaining
after such improvements have been made shall be returned to the owner or subdivider.
The Common Council at its option, may extend the bond period for an additional period
not to exceed two years.
(4) The developer may elect to have these improvements constructed in one of the two
following ways:
a. The developer may construct the improvements through his own financing and
construction. In this case the developer will prepare utility plans with construction
estimates, which shall be submitted to the City for review and approval prior to
construction. The construction shall be inspected as determined by the City to see
that it is in compliance with the Citys construction design requirements. Upon
completion of these improvements, they shall be accepted by the City when found
to be in conformity with City standards as determined by the Director of Public
Works.
b. The developer may elect to request the City to construct the improvements under the
Citys Capital Improvement Program. In this case the City will design and construct
the improvements under the next Public Works Program that it can be included in.
The City will bill the developer for the design and the developers share of these
improvements as per subsection (5) herein. Should the developer elect to have the
City make the improvements, such request shall be made prior to, but in no event
later than October 1 of the year preceding construction.
(5) The subdivider can finance his share of the public improvements defined above by either
of the following 2 methods:
a. By requesting the City to finance these improvements under Wisconsin Statutes
§66.0703 pertaining to special assessments.
1. The City will proceed under the special assessment methods of Wisconsin
Statutes §66.0703 for financing only for projects involving 1 block in distance.
The council may waive this requirement upon the presentation of specific
circumstances which preclude the development to proceed in at least 1 block
units.
2. Should the developer pursue financing through Wisconsin Statutes §66.0703
(repayment in 10 equal installments) the remaining special assessment against
any lot plus accrued interest shall be payable upon the sale of such lot.
b. The developer may proceed to finance this project through its own private finances.
In this case, the developer shall reimburse the City for its share of the actual costs
of construction of the improvements as they are made upon presentation of a bill to
the developer by the City.

public way shall be made part of the plat and dedicated or reserved by the subdivider in the
locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or maps and in accordance with this Section.
(b) DETERMINATION. Whenever a proposed school site, park, playground, greenway, open
space or other public land, other than streets or drainageways, designated in the master plan,
comprehensive plan component or on the official map of the City is embraced, all or in part,
in a tract of land to be subdivided, these proposed public lands shall be made a part of the plat
and shall be dedicated to the public at the rate of one (1) acre for each twenty-five (25)
proposed dwelling units; and said proposed public lands, other than streets or drainageways,
in excess of the rate established herein shall be reserved for a period not to exceed one (1) year
from the date of final plat approval unless extended by mutual agreement for purchase by the
public agency having jurisdiction, or unless extended by a mutual agreement for acquisition by
the City. The purchase price shall be the present fair market value of said lands in an
undeveloped state as indicated by impartial appraisal. Costs for said appraisal are to be shared
equally between developer and City.
(c) PROPORTIONATE PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
(1) a. If the amount of land required to be dedicated, other than for streets and
drainageways as indicated on the master plan, comprehensive plan component or
official map of the City totals less than the ratio of one (1) acre for each twenty-five
(25) proposed dwelling units, the subdivider shall pay to the City a fee equivalent

upon recommendation by the Planning Commission. Any and all interest accumulated
upon such funds shall be added to the Special Fund and be used only for acquisition and
developments for said purposes.
(d) DEVELOPMENT OF DEDICATED AREA. It shall be the duty of the City to properly
develop and maintain the dedicated areas and the owner who dedicated said land shall in no
way be responsible for its development, maintenance or liability thereon except that said owner
shall not develop the surrounding area in a manner which would unduly depreciate the purpose,
use or value of the dedicated property and except if such owner shall reside on one of the
subdivided parcels, in which case he shall be responsible for the maintenance of adjacent public
property as may be required in other laws of the City.
SEC. 10-4-10 VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
(a) Where the Common Council finds that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may
result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may recommend to the Common
Council variations or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and
the public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
Subdivisions
(b) The Common Council shall not recommend variations or exceptions to the regulations of this
Chapter unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:
(1) The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
(2) The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property
for which the variation is sought and are not applicable, generally to other property;

Introduction
SEC. 10-6-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
This Chapter for floodplain protection is adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in
Sections and 61.35 and 62.23, Wis. Stats.
SEC. 10-6-2 FINDING OF FACT.
Uncontrolled development and use of the shoreland-wetlands, floodplains, river and streams, and
the pollution of the navigable waters of this municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated
responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and
control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of
structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty.
SEC. 10-6-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a uniform basis for the preparation, implementation and
administration of sound floodplain regulations for all floodplains within the City of Neillsville to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
(c) Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments,
nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
(d) Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and
other fish and aquatic habitat;
(e) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
(f) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and
other earth moving activities;
(g) Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood control projects;
(h) Reduce rescue and relief efforts, generally undertaken at the expense of the tax paying public;
(i) Prevent business interruptions which usually result in the loss of local income;
(j) Reduce damage to public facilities such as utilities, municipal buildings, streets and bridges which
may be located in the floodplains;
(k) Prevent the occurrence of future flood blight areas on floodplains;
(l) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
(m) Prevent increases in regional flood heights which could increase damage during floods and which may
result in conflicts or litigation between property owners; and
(n) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use
or structure outside of the floodplain.

Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
SEC. 10-6-4 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Ordinance for the
City of Neillsville, Wisconsin.
SECS. 10-6-5 THROUGH 10-6-9 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
ARTICLE B
General Provisions
SEC. 10-6-10 COMPLIANCE - OTHER PERMITS.
Any development, as defined in Sec. 10-6-90 in floodplains and shoreland-wetlands shall be in full
compliance with the terms of this chapter. (However, see Article H, of this chapter, for the standards applicable
to nonconforming uses.) It is the responsibility of the applicant to secure all other necessary permits from
appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, including those required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1344.
SEC. 10-6-11 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply
with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section
13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Sec. 30.2022, Wis. Stats.,
applies.
SEC. 10-6-12 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS; INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER.
(a) GREATER RESTRICTIONS. This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under Sections 62.23 Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains or shorelandwetlands
except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the
provisions contained in this Chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the
extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. The more restrictive of either the Shoreland-
Wetland District or Floodplain District regulations shall apply when a property is located in both
zoning districts.
(b) ABROGATION. It is not otherwise intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions; however, where this chapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
(c) INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be
held to be minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not
be deemed a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where
a provision of this Chapter is required by a standard in Chapter NR 116, Wisconsin Administrative
Code, and where the meaning of the Chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted
in light of the Chapter NR 116 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this Chapter or in
effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.
SEC. 10-6-13 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience and scientific methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside of the delineated floodplain
or permitted land uses within the floodplain will be totally free from flooding and associated flood
damages, nor does this Chapter create a liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the City or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this Chapter.

(a) The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the City which are five (5) acres or
more in size and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory map that has been adopted and made a
part of this chapter in Sec. 10-6-14 and which are:
(1) Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable lakes, ponds
or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City shall be presumed to be navigable
if they are listed in the Department publication "Surface Water Resources of Clark
County" or shown on the United States Geological Water Survey quadrangle maps or
other zoning base maps which have been made a part of this chapter in Sec. 10-6-14.
(2) Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable rivers
or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.
Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either
continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey
quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by
reference and made a part of this chapter in Sec. 10-6-14. Floodplain zoning maps
adopted in Sec. 10-6-14 shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas.
(b) Determinations of navigability and ordinary highwater mark location shall initially be made
by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the
appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or
ordinary highwater mark.
(c) When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on
the official zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the
Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if
the shoreland-wetland district boundary, as mapped, is in error. If Department staff concur with the
Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in
accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland
mapping errors shown on the official zoning maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible
for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.
(d) Under Sec. 144.26(?-m), Wis. Stats., notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative
rule, wetland zoning ordinances required under Sec. 61.351 for villages or 62.231 for cities, WIS.
Stats., and Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage
ditches if:
(1) Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river,
(2) Those parts of the drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams
before ditching; and
(3) Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.

General Provisions for All Floodplains
SEC. 10-6-30 AREAS TO BE REGULATED.
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. Note:
Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood
elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
SEC. 10-6-31 OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS; ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
(a) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps
listed below and the revisions in the Neillsville Floodplain Appendix. Any changes to the base
flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes
to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Public Works Director, City of
Neillsville, If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall
apply.
(1) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the FIS:
a. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55019C0678D, 55019C0679D,
55019C0686D, 55019C0687D and 55019C0691D dated July 6, 2010, with
corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated
July 6, 2010, Volume number 55019CV000A.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on other studies:
a. None
(b) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood waters.
(2) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood
limits and the floodway.
(3) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by
flood water during the regional flood.

SEC. 10-6-32 LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall
be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall
be amended according to s. 10-6-100. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a
profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The
zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the
basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required
under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary
line shall be settled according to s. 10-6-93(e) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district
boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the
map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must
also approve any map amendment pursuant to s. 10-6-100(d).
SEC. 10-6-33 REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN.
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from
the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is
contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 10-6-100.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance.
The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
SEC. 10-6-34 HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC ANALYSIS.
(a) No development shall be allowed in floodplain areas which will:
(1) Cause an obstruction to flow, defined in Sec. 10-6-120 as any development which
physically blocks the conveyance of flood waters by itself or in conjunction with future
similar development causing an increase in regional flood height; or
(2) Cause an increase in regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which is
equal to or exceeding 0.01 foot except as provided in paragraph (b) below.
(b) Obstruction or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments
made to this ordinance, the official floodplain zoning maps, including floodway lines and water
surface profiles, according to Sec. 10-6-38 and Article J.
(c) The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits where it is determined the proposed development
will cause an obstruction to flow or increase in regional flood height of 0.01 foot or greater.
SEC. 10-6-35 MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES.
(a) Owners or operators of all manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall provide adequate surface
drainage to minimize flood damage, and prepare, secure approval and file an evacuation plan,
indicating vehicular access and escape routes, with local emergency management authorities.
(b) In existing manufactured home parks, all new homes, replacement homes on existing pads, and
substantially improved homes shall:
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
(1) have the lowest floor elevated to the flood protection elevation; and
(2) be anchored so they do not float, collapse or move laterally during a flood.
(c) Outside of existing manufactured home parks, including new manufactured home parks and all single
units outside of existing parks, all new, replacement and substantially improved manufactured homes
shall meet the residential development standards for the floodfringe in s. 10-6-62(b).
SEC. 10-6-36 WATERCOURSE ALTERATIONS.
Prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and prior to the issuance of any land use
permit which may be required for the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the local zoning official shall
notify adjacent municipalities, regional office of the Department and the appropriate office of FEMA and
shall require the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The flood carrying capacity
within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. As soon as is practicable, but

for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary highwater mark of a navigable waterway and
is retained in place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudholes attached to the
bed of the waterway.
(18) Flood or Flooding - A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas caused by:
a. The overflow or rise of inland waters
b. The rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
c. The inundation caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels along the shore of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior; and
d. The sudden increase caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of
water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such
as a seiche, or by some similarly unusual event.
(19) Flood Frequency - The probability of a flood occurrence. A flood frequency is generally
determined from statistical analyses. The frequency of g particular flood event is usually
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
expressed as occurring, on the average, once in a specified number of ears or as a percent (%)
chance of occurring in any given year.
(20) Flood Fringe - That portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway, which is covered by
flood waters during the regional flood; and generally associated with standing water rather than
flowing water.
(21) Flood Hazard Boundary Map - A map prepared by FEMA. designating approximate flood
hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are designated as unnumbered A Zones and do not contain
floodway lines or regional flood elevations. Said map forms the basis for both the regulatory
and insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance program.
(21m) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - A map of a community on which the Federal Insurance
Administration has delineated both special flood hazard areas (the floodplain)and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community. This map can only be amended by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(22) Flood Insurance Study - A technical engineering examination, evaluation, and determination
of the City flood hazard areas. It provides maps designating those areas affected by the regional
flood and provides both flood insurance rate zones and regional flood elevations and may
provide floodway lines. The flood hazard areas are designated as unnumbered and numbered
A Zones. Flood insurance study maps form the basis for both the regulatory and the insurance
aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(23) Floodplain - That land which has been or may be hereafter covered by flood water during the
regional flood. The floodplain includes the floodway and the flood fringe, and may include
other designated floodplain areas for regulatory purposes.
(24) Floodplain Island - A natural geologic land formation within the floodplain that is surrounded,
but not covered, by flood water during the regional flood.
(25) Floodplain Management - The full range of public policy and action for insuring wise use

data to the acquisition of floodplain lands and the enactment and administration of codes,
ordinances and statutes for land use in the floodplain.
(26) Flood Profile - A graph or a longitudinal profile line showing the relationship of the water
surface elevation of a flood event to locations of land surface elevations along a stream or river.
(27) Floodproofing - Any combination of structural provisions, changes or adjustments to
properties and structures, water and sanitary facilities and contents of buildings subject to
flooding for the purpose of reducing or eliminating flood damage.
(28) Flood Protection Elevation - An elevation of two (2) feet of freeboard above the water
surface profile associated with the regional flood. (Also see: Freeboard.)
(29) Floodway - The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the
channel required to carry the regional flood discharge.
(30) Floodway Encroachment Lines - Represent the limits of obstruction to flood flows. These lines
are designated on both sides of, and generally parallel to, the channel of a river or stream. They
are established by assuming that the area landward (outside of the encroachment lines) will
ultimately be developed in such a way that it will not convey flood flows, but the development
will not cause an increase to regional flood elevations upstream. It is assumed that any
development riverward of these lines will cause an obstruction and will require a detailed
analysis to determine its effect on the regional flood elevations upstream.
(31) Freeboard - Represents a factor of safety usually expressed in terms of a certain amount of feed
above a calculated flood level, factors that contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated. These unknown factors include, but are not limited to, ice jams, debris accumulation,
wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the effects of urbanization on
the hydrology of the watershed, loss of flood storage areas due to development and aggradation
of the river or stream bed.

for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain
zoning regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures. For purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures
for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
(40) NGVD or National Geodetic Vertical Datum - Elevations referenced to mean sea level
datum, 1929 adjustment.
(41) Nonconforming Structure - An existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity
with the dimensional or structural requirements of this Chapter for the area of floodplain which
it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the flood fringe district is a
conforming use. However, if the first floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the
structure is nonconforming.)
(42) Nonconforming Use - A nonconforming use is an existing lawful use or accessory use of a
structure, building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter for the area
of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the floodway.)
(43) Obstruction to Flow - Any development which physically blocks the conveyance of flood
waters such that this development by itself or in conjunction with any future similar develop
ment will cause an increase in regional flood height.

holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different
parcel than the structure.
(50) Public Utilities - Those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as
electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water,
sanitary sewer and storm sewer.
(50m) Reasonably Safe From Flooding - Means base flood waters will not inundate the land or
damage structures to be removed from the special flood hazard area and that any subsurface
waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings.
(51) Regional Flood - A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have
generally occurred in Wisconsin and which may be expected to occur on a particular stream
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
because of like physical characteristics. The flood frequency of the regional flood is once in
every 100 years. This means that in any given year, there is a 1% chance that the regional
flood may occur or be exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is
equivalent to the BFE. During a typical 30-year mortgage period, the regional flood has a
26% chance of occurrence. The regional flood is based upon a statistical analysis of stream
flow records available for the watershed or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics
in the general watershed region or both. FEMA uses the term "base flood" which means the
regional flood.
(52) Shorelands - Lands within the following distances from the ordinary highwater mark of
navigable waters; 1,000 feet from a lake, pond or flowage; and 300 feet from a river or
stream or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.
(53) Shoreland-Wetland District - The zoning district, created in this zoning Chapter, comprised
of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the wetlands inventory maps which have
been adopted and made a part of this Chapter.
(53m) Start of Construction - The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

be occupied by flood water of a given stage at a given time, regardless of whether the water
is moving.
(55) Structure - Any man-made object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or
temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, which
includes, but is not limited to, such objects as roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid
storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
(55m) Subdivision - Has the meaning given in s. 236.02(12, Wis. Stats.
(55r) Substantial Damage - Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred.
(56) Substantial Improvement - Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the present equalized assessed value
of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has
been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The term does not,
however, include either:
a. any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or
b. any alteration of a structure or site documented as deserving preservation by the
Wisconsin State Historical Society or listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications
or additions; such ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and
external painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows
Floodplain and Shoreland-Wetland Zoning
and other nonstructural components. (For purposes of this definition, "substantial
improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.)
(57) Unnecessary Hardship - That circumstance where special conditions, which were not
self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity with the restrictions
governing dimensional standards (such as area, setbacks, frontage, or height) unnecessarily
burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purpose of this Chapter. Unnecessary hardship is
present only where, in the absence of a variance, no feasible use can be made of the
property.
(58) Variance - An authorization granted by the Board of Appeals to construct, alter or use a
building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional standards of this
Chapter. A variance may not permit a use of property otherwise prohibited by the Chapter
or allow construction not protected to the flood protection elevation.
(58m) Violation - The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits,
lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing, certificates or required floodway
encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documenta
tion is provided.
(59) Watershed - The entire region or area contributing runoff or surface water to a particular
watercourse or body of water.
(60) Water Surface Profile - A graphical representation showing the elevation of the water
surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood
flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.
(60m) Well - An excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or
other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.
(61) Wetlands - Those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough to
support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions.
(62) Wetland Alteration - Any construction filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching, tiling,
excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike and dam construction in a
wetland area.

INDEX
INDEX TO CODE
(References are to section numbers)
USE OF INDEX: This index is designed for user ease. To locate information found in the code,
formulate a specific question. The key words in that question then become guides for using the index.
In the event you do not locate the desired information on your first attempt, the following checklist
may help.
(1) Cross references (when needed) are always located at the beginning of entries. Have
you overlooked any?
(2) Frequently initial questions are too general. Reformulating a more specific question
may help.
(3) Information on officials can be found in two ways. The entry for an official's name
contains general duties as well as conditions of his office, such as compensation and
tenure. Duties assigned to him by ordinances on specific subjects will be found under
those subjects.
(4) Definitions can be located under the "DEFINITIONS" main heading or in specific
subject areas through the subheading "Definitions of terms."
