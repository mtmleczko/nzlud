PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Pewaukee, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as amended, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a point. The figure before the point refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the point refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6.1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6.1 and 6.2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6.1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dave Poucher, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Jennifer Sheiffer, Village Administrator, and Mr. Timothy Garrity, Village Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the conference and the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Sec. 2.148. - Public access to records.

Sec. 2.149. - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37. Except as otherwise provided, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail unless prepayment of a fee is required under section 2.148(e)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  The legal custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons for such denial. If the legal custodian determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner that would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2.150. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1) or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Ord. No. 287, § 1(5), 1-18-1983) 
Sec. 2.150. - Limitations on right to access. 
(a)  Exemptions. As provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.36, the following records are exempt from inspection under this article: 
(1)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law; 
(2)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state; 
(3)  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection; and 
(4)  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(b)  Public library records. As provided by Wis. Stats. § 43.30, public library records are exempt from inspection under this article. 
(c)  Denial. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality, which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
(2)  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing. 
(3)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any Village of Pewaukee officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a village officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
(4)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
(5)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of village property, investing of village funds, or other village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
(6)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data. 
(7)  Communications between legal counsel for the village and any officer, agent or employee of the village, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(d)  Records containing both exempt and nonexempt material. If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the legal custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. If in the judgment of the legal custodian there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(e)  Contractors' records. Each authority shall make available for inspection and copying under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1) any record produced or collected under a contract entered into by the authority with a person other than an authority to the same extent as if the record were maintained by the authority. This subsection does not apply to the inspection or copying of a record under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(am). 
(f)  Identities of applicants for public positions. 
(1)  In this section, "final candidate" means each applicant for a position who is seriously considered for appointment or whose name is certified for appointment and whose name is submitted for final consideration to an authority for appointment to any state position, except a position in the classified service, or to any local public office, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.42(7w). "Final candidate" includes, whenever there are at least five candidates for an office or position, each of the five candidates who are considered most qualified for the office or position by an authority, and whenever there are less than five candidates for an office or position, each such candidate. Whenever an appointment is to be made from a group of more than five candidates, "final candidate" also includes each candidate in the group. 
(2)  Every applicant for a position with any authority may indicate in writing to the authority that the applicant does not wish the authority to reveal his identity. Except with respect to a final candidate, if an applicant makes such an indication in writing, the authority shall not provide access to any record related to the application that may reveal the identity of the applicant. 
(g)  Identities of law enforcement informants. 
(1)  In this subsection: 
a.  "Informant" means an individual who requests confidentiality from a law enforcement agency in conjunction with providing information to that agency or, pursuant to an express promise of confidentiality by a law enforcement agency or under circumstances in which a promise of confidentiality would reasonably be implied, provides information to a law enforcement agency or is working with a law enforcement agency to obtain information, related in any case to any of the following: 
1.  Another person who the individual or the law enforcement agency suspects has violated, is violating or will violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
2.  Past, present or future activities that the individual or law enforcement agency believes may violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
b.  "Law enforcement agency" has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 165.83(1)(b), and includes the department of corrections. 
(2)  If an authority that is a law enforcement agency receives a request to inspect or copy a record or portion of a record under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(a) that contains specific information, including but not limited to a name, address, telephone number, voice recording or handwriting sample which, if disclosed, would identify an informant, the authority shall delete the portion of the record in which the information is contained or, if no portion of the record can be inspected or copied without identifying the informant, shall withhold the record unless the legal custodian of the record, designated under Wis. Stats. § 19.33, makes a determination, at the time the request is made, that the public interest in allowing a person to inspect, copy or receive a copy of such identifying information outweighs the harm done to the public interest by providing such access. 
(Ord. No. 287, § 1(6), 1-18-1983) 
Sec. 2.151. - Destruction of records. 
(a)  Financial records.

Property owners should also be aware of erosion control provisions found in chapter 14, article VII of the Village of Pewaukee Code, which may also be applicable. 
(c)  The property owner or entity in control of land or parcel shall, when engaging in land-developing activity or land disturbing construction activity, employ appropriate erosion control measures to control and abate erosion on, through and from the construction site.

Sec. 14.326. - Authority for article. 
(a)  This article is adopted by the village board under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 281.33 and ch. 236. 
(b)  The requirements of this article do not pre-empt more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource administrative rules, permits or approvals, including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § NR151.004, Wis. Admin. Code.

(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 2(exh. A), 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 14.328. - Findings of fact. 
    The Pewaukee Village Board finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled soil erosion and storm water runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing ground water recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants; 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads; 
(4)  Reduce the quality of ground water by increasing pollutant loading; 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers, drainage ways and other storm drainage systems; 
(6)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and 
(7)  Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 2(exh. A), 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 14.329. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish regulatory requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources of the village from construction site erosion and post-construction storm water runoff. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; establish erosion control and storm water standards for building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger property. 
(b)  Intent. Through a single storm water permit process, this article is intended to meet the current construction site erosion control and post-construction storm water management regulatory requirements of Subchapter III of both NR 151 and NR 216 Wis. Admin. Code on the effective date of the ordinance [from which this article is derived]. Nothing in this article prevents the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources from adopting or enforcing more stringent storm water management requirements in future revisions of Wis. Admin. Code. 
    Provisions have also been incorporated to coordinate the storm water permit requirements of this article with other village zoning and land division regulations.

(Ord. No. 2016-03, § 2(exh. A), 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 14.334. - Erosion control plan requirements. 
(a)  General erosion control plan requirements and performance standards. An erosion control plan shall describe how the permit holder and other responsible party will minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, soil erosion and the transport of sediment from land disturbing activities to waters of the state or other property. To meet this requirement, the following performance standards shall apply: 
(1)  All erosion control plans and associated BMPs shall comply with the planning, design, implementation and maintenance requirements of this article. 
(2)  All erosion control plans shall by design, achieve to the maximum extent practicable, a runoff discharge of no more than five tons of sediment per acre per year from sheet and rill erosion during land disturbing activities, as compared with no sediment or erosion controls, until the site is stabilized. 
(3)  Erosion and sediment control BMPs may be used alone or in combination to meet the above noted performance standard. The requirements of this section 14.334 are designed to meet this standard. 
Note- Soil loss prediction tools are available that can estimate the sediment load leaving the construction site under varying land and management conditions and the application of erosion control BMPs. An example of such a tool is the universal soil loss equation (USLE), published by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has prepared a model based on the USLE, which may be used to demonstrate compliance with the above noted performance standard. 
(b)  Guiding principles for erosion control. To satisfy the requirements of this section, an erosion control plan shall, to the maximum extent practicable, adhere to the following guiding principles: 
(1)  Propose grading that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, environmental corridors and any applicable regulatory setbacks from these areas; 
(2)  Minimize, through project phasing and construction sequencing, the time the disturbed soil surface is exposed to erosive forces; 
(3)  Minimize soil compaction, the loss of trees and other natural vegetation and the size of the disturbed area at any one time; 
(4)  Locate erosion control BMPs prior to runoff leaving the site or entering waters of the state and outside of wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental corridors or isolated natural areas; 
(5)  Emphasize the use of BMPs that prevent soil detachment and transport over those aimed to reduce soil deposition (sedimentation) or repair erosion damage. 
(c)  Specific erosion control plan requirements. The following applicable minimum requirements shall be addressed in erosion control plans to the maximum extent practicable. The director or his designee may establish more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements than the minimums set forth in this section if the director or his designee determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect an environmentally sensitive area or other property, or to address a change made during plan implementation. 
(1)  Access drives and tracking. Provide access drive(s) for construction vehicles that minimize tracking of soil off site using BMPs such as stone tracking pads, tire washing or grates. Minimize runoff and sediment from adjacent areas from flowing down or eroding the access drive. 
(2)  Diversion of upslope runoff. Divert excess runoff from upslope land, rooftops or other surfaces, if practicable, using BMPs such as earthen diversion berms, silt fence and downspout extenders. Prevent erosion of the flow path and the outlet. 
(3)  Inlet protection. Protect inlets to storm drains, culverts and other storm water conveyance systems from siltation until the site is stabilized. 
(4)  Soil stockpiles. Locate soil stockpiles away from channelized flow and no closer than 25 feet from roads, ditches, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands or environmental corridors, unless otherwise approved by the director or his designee. Control sediment from soil stockpiles. Any soil stockpile that remains for more than 30 days shall be stabilized. 
(5)  Cut and fill slopes. Minimize the length and steepness of proposed cut and fill slopes and stabilize them as soon as practicable. 
(6)  Channel flow. During construction, trap sediment in channelized flow before discharge from the site using BMPS such as sediment traps and sediment basins. Complete final grading and stabilize open channels in accordance with director or his designee standards as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the first freeze or snow cover in the fall. 
(7)  Outlet protection . Protect outlets from erosion during site dewatering and storm water conveyance, including velocity dissipation at pipe outfalls or open channels entering or leaving a storm water management facility. 
(8)  Overland flow. Trap sediment in overland flow before discharge from the site using BMPs such as silt fence and vegetative filter strips. 
(9)  Site dewatering. Treat pumped water to remove sediment prior to discharge from the site, using BMPs such as sediment basins and portable sediment tanks. 
(10)  Dust control. Prevent excessive dust from leaving the construction site though construction phasing and timely stabilization or the use of BMPs such as site watering and mulch-especially with very dry or fine sandy soils. 
(11)  Topsoil application. Save existing topsoil and reapply a minimum of four inches to all disturbed areas for final stabilization, unless otherwise approved by the director or his designee, such as for temporary seeding or storm water infiltration BMPs. If adequate topsoil does not exist on the site to meet this requirement, it shall be imported. 
(12)  Waste material. Recycle or properly dispose all waste and unused building materials in a timely manner. Control runoff from waste materials until they are removed or reused. 
(13)  Sediment cleanup. By the end of each workday, clean up all off-site sediment deposits or tracked soil that originated from the permitted site. Flushing shall not be allowed unless runoff is treated before discharge from the site. 
(14)  Final site stabilization. All previous cropland areas where land disturbing activities will not be occurring under the proposed grading plans, shall be stabilized upon permit issuance. Stabilize all other disturbed areas within seven days of final grading and topsoil application. Large sites shall be treated in stages as final grading is completed in each stage. Any soil erosion that occurs after final grading or the application of stabilization measures must be repaired and the stabilization work redone. 
(15)  Temporary site stabilization. Any disturbed site that remains inactive for greater than seven days shall be stabilized with temporary stabilization measures such as soil treatment, temporary seeding or mulching. For purposes of this subsection, "inactive" means that no site grading, landscaping or utility work is occurring on the site and that precipitation events are not limiting these activities. Frozen soils do not exclude the site from this requirement. 
(16)  Removal of practices. Remove all temporary BMPs such as silt fences, ditch checks and sediment traps as soon as all disturbed areas have been stabilized. 
(17)  Site drainage. Site drainage plans shall comply with the provisions of section 14.335(d)(6) below. 
(18)  Stormwater BMP data. When a storm water permit involves the maintenance of an existing storm water BMP, including the removal of accumulated sediment, the director or his designee may require additional support data such as before/after surveys, design and construction details, and oversight by a professional engineer licensed in Wisconsin. 
(d)  Preliminary erosion control plan contents. Preliminary erosion and sediment control plans shall contain the following items: 
(1)  A site map in accordance with section 14.335(c) below;

(25)  Notes describing source documents, date and measure of accuracy for all applicable mapping features noted above; 
(26)  Other site information that the director or his designee determines is necessary to administer this article. 
(d)  Specific storm water management plan requirements and performance standards. All storm water management plans and associated BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements to the maximum extent practicable. All requirements apply to each subwatershed or storm water discharge point independently and cannot be averaged for the site. Runoff draining to a storm water BMP from offsite must be accounted for hydraulically in any BMP design. It is highly recommended that the applicant meet with the director or his designee prior to preparing a storm water management plan to determine the applicability of these requirements early in the site planning process. 
Note- The "maximum extent possible" (MEP) standard applies to each of the seven sections of plan requirements and performance standards described below. 
(1)  Peak discharge. 
a.  Minimum requirement. To minimize downstream bank erosion and the failure of downstream conveyance systems, the calculated post-development peak storm water discharge rate shall not exceed the calculated pre-development discharge rates for the one-year, two-year, ten-year, and 100-year, 24-hour design storms. Modeling requirements for this provision are further described in section 14.336 below. 
b.  Release rate per acre. The director or his designee may establish a maximum allowable release rate on a per acre basis that would supercede the requirements of subsection a. above for certain watersheds after the necessary hydrologic modeling is completed and the maximum release rate is approved by the storm water advisory committee. 
(2)  Total suspended solids. 
a.  By design, each storm water management plan shall meet the following post-development total suspended solids reduction targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as compared to no runoff management controls: 
1.  For new land development and in-fill development, 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids load; 
2.  For redevelopment, 40 percent reduction of total suspended solids load from parking areas and roads; 
Note- The first flush of storm water runoff from an urban landscape contains the vast majority of pollutants, which tend to be associated with suspended solids. Pollutant loading models such as SLAMM, P8 or equivalent methodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency of the design in reducing total suspended solids under subsection a. above. 
(3)  Infiltration. 
a.  BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the performance standards in Table 1, except as provided in subsections d. through h. below. 
Table 1

1.  All percentages are based on average annual rainfall 
2.  To avoid downstream flooding and chronic wetness issues from storm water discharges, the post-development infiltration volume for low density residential developments shall not be less than 25 percent of the two-year, 24-hour storm, in accordance with subsection (7) below. 
b.  Modeling. Refer to section 14.336(a) for details on calculating runoff volumes and pre-development conditions. 
c.  Pretreatment. Pretreatment shall be required before infiltrating parking lot and road runoff from commercial, industrial and institutional areas. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect ground water quality in accordance with subsection h. below. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separators, sedimentation or bioretention basins, filtration swales or filter strips. All designs shall comply with the technical standards in section 14.336(b). 
d.  Infiltration prohibitions. Due to potential for ground water contamination, runoff shall not be infiltrated and will not be credited toward meeting the requirements of this subsection for the following: 
1.  Runoff from outdoor material storage and loading docks for tier 1 and tier 2 industrial facilities, as identified in NR 216(2) Wis. Admin. Code. Parking lot runoff from tier 1 industrial facilities is prohibited. Parking lot runoff from tier 2 facilities may be infiltrated, but may require pretreatment. 
2.  Runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas, not including rooftops and canopies. 
3.  Infiltration of runoff within 1,000 feet upgradient or within 100 feet downgradient of karst features. 
4.  Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as specified in § NR 811.16(4), Wis. Admin. Code, or within 100 feet of a private well as specified in § NR 812.08(4), Wis. Admin. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development, not including rooftop runoff. 
5.  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in § NR 720.03(2), Wis. Admin. Code are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur. 
e.  Separation distances. Infiltration BMPs shall be located so the characteristics of the soil and the separation distance between the bottom of the infiltration BMP and the elevation of the highest ground water table or the top of bedrock are in accordance with Table 2. 
Table 2
Infiltration BMP Separation Distances and Soil Characteristics 
Source Area Ground water or Bedrock Separation Distance Soil Characteristics Industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roads 5 feet or more Filtering layer Residential arterial roads 5 feet or more Filtering layer Roofs draining to subsurface infiltration practices 1 foot or more Native or engineered soil with particles finer than coarse sand Roofs draining to surface infiltration practices Not applicable Not applicable All other impervious source areas 3 feet or more Filtering layer  
f.  Infiltration exemptions. The infiltration requirements of this subsection may be exempted by the director or his designee where: 
1.  The soils at the proposed bottom of the infiltration system have a measured infiltration rate of less than 0.6 inches per hour using a scientifically credible field test method: and 
2.  The director or his designee determines it would be impracticable to modify existing soil conditions based on soil profile evaluations extending five feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration system. 
Note- USDA soil textures of sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, or clay are generally considered unsuitable for infiltration and would require replacement or modification. 
g.  Alternate runoff uses. Where storage and reuse of runoff are employed, such as landscape watering, toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation or storage on green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate uses shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section. 
h.  Ground water protection. 
1.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this subsection shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to ground water and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Chapter NR 140 Wis. Admin. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection 1. above, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
3.  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter NR815 Wis. Admin. Code relating to injection wells. 
4.  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the provisions of any applicable wellhead protection plan for a community water supply under Chapter NR 811 Wis. Admin. Code. 
(4)  Protective areas. 
a.  Definitions. " Protective area " means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
1.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet. 
2.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on the Waukesha County GIS system, 50 feet. If there is a discrepancy between the Waukesha County GIS system and the applicable United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, the more stringent stream identification shall apply. 
3.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
4.  For wetlands not subject to subsection 5., 50 feet. 
5.  For highly susceptible wetlands, as determined by the director or his designee, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, lowland hardwood swamps and ephemeral ponds. 
6.  Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with Chapter NR 103 Wis. Admin. Code. This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. 
7.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet unless otherwise required by another applicable regulation. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass. 
8.  In subsection a.1., 4., and 5, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Chapter NR 103 Wis. Admin. Code. 
9.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
b.  Requirements. The following requirements shall be met for all land development activity located within a protective area: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area, except for structures, as authorized and defined under shoreland and floodland zoning. The erosion control plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the storm water management plan shall contain a written site specific explanation and a technical exemption may be applied under subsection c. below. 
2.  Where land disturbing activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area, but shall not encroach into wetlands, floodplains or primary or secondary environmental corridors. 
Note- Other regulations, such as Wis. Stats. ch. 30, and chs. NR 103, 115, 116 and 117, Wis. Admin. Code, and their associated review and approval process may apply in the protective area. 
c.  Protective area exemptions. The protective area requirements of this subsection may be exempted in accordance with subsection (e) below and do not apply to the following: 
1.  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts; 
2.  Structures constructed in accordance with village shoreland management ordinance; and 
3.  Sites where runoff does not enter the surface water, including wetlands, without first being treated by a BMP to meet the total suspended solids requirements under subsection 2. above and peak discharge requirements under subsection 1. above, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability. 
(5)  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
Note- A combination of the following BMPs may be used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup materials, or any other structural or non-structural method of preventing or treating petroleum in runoff. 
(6)  Site drainage. Measures shall be implemented to ensure proper site drainage, prevent property damage and protect public health and safety, including the following minimum requirements: 
a.  Drainage easement. Perpetual drainage easements or other deed restrictions shall be recorded on the property to preserve major storm water flow paths and permanent storm water BMP locations. Covenants in these areas shall not allow buildings or other structures and shall prevent any grading, filling or other activities that interrupt or obstruct flows in any way. Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in accordance with section 14.337. 
b.  Site grading. Site grading shall ensure positive flows away from all buildings, roads, driveways and septic systems, be coordinated with the general storm water drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties. 
c.  Street drainage. All street drainage shall be designed to prevent concentrated flows from crossing the traffic lanes to the maximum extent practicable. Design flow depths at the road centerline for on-street drainage, shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. 
d.  Bridges and cross-culverts. All new or modified bridges and cross-culverts shall comply with applicable design standards and regulations, facilitate fish passage and prevent increased flooding or channel erosion upstream or downstream from the structure. Design flow depths at the road centerline for all crossings shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. All predevelopment runoff storage areas within the flow path upstream of bridges and cross-culverts shall be preserved and designated as drainage easements, unless compensatory storage is provided and accounted for in modeling. As-built documentation shall be submitted in accordance with section 14.333 for all new or modified structures that are located within a mapped floodplain or that the director or his designee determines to be necessary to maintain floodplain modeling for the applicable watershed. 
e.  Subsurface drainage. Basement floor surfaces shall be built one foot above the highest ground water table elevation, as documented in the submitted soil evaluations, and shall avoid hydric soils as much as possible. The director or his designee shall be notified of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which the director or his designee may require to be restored or connected to other drainage systems. No concentrated discharge of ground water from tile lines, downspouts, sump pumps or other means shall be allowed closer than ten feet to a property boundary or where a structure from which the discharge is occurring is less than ten feet from the property boundary, then in that event one-half the distance between the structure and the boundary. The discharge shall be adequately diffused before reaching the lot boundary. 
f.  Open channels. All open channel drainage systems shall at a minimum be designed to carry the peak flows from a ten-year, 24-hour design storm using planned land use for the entire contributing watershed area. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3h:1v unless otherwise approved by the director or his designee for unique site conditions. Open channels that carry runoff from more than 130 acres shall at a minimum be designed to carry the peak flows from a 25-year, 24-hour design storm. 
g.  Storm sewers. All storm sewers shall be designed in accordance with applicable community technical standards and specifications. 
h.  Changes to storm water discharges. For sites where the director or his designee determines the post-development storm water discharge flow paths will be significantly different than pre-development conditions, or where proposed storm water discharges may otherwise have a significant negative impact on downstream property(ies), the director or his designee may require the applicant to submit written authorization, record a drainage easement, or complete other legal arrangements with the affected property owner(s) prior to permit issuance. 
i.  Structure protection and safety. Flows generated by the ten-year, 24-hour design storm under planned land use conditions may exceed the design capacity of conveyance systems, but shall not come in contact with any buildings. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular basis, the following additional requirements shall apply: 
1.  The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface shall be a minimum of two feet above the maximum water elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, including flows through any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot; and 
2.  The structure shall be set back at least 50 feet horizontally from any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot. Setback distance shall be measured from the closest edge of water at the elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. 
(7)  Additional requirements. The director or his designee may establish more stringent requirements than the minimums set forth in this section, such as addressing thermal impacts of storm water, downstream flooding, a total maximum daily load (TMDL) standard for a watershed, other applicable state or federal laws, an order of any court of competent jurisdiction, or chronic wetness conditions, if the director or his designee determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect: 
a.  An environmentally sensitive area; 
b.  A downstream property; 
c.  Public health or safety. 
(e)  Technical exemptions. 
(1)  Exemption criteria. Following the provisions of this subsection, the director or his designee may exempt a site or a portion of a site from meeting certain technical requirements of this section if the director or his designee determines that exemption criteria under subsection (d) above or one or more of the following applies: 
a.  Off-site BMP(s). The requirement has been satisfied through the use of off-site BMP(s). Off-site BMPs could be installed beyond the boundaries of the property covered by the application as part of a regional storm water management plan or through other legal arrangements. However, to be eligible for this exemption, the off-site BMP(s) must treat runoff from the site covered by the application; 
b.  No significant off-site impacts. The proposed land disturbing or land development activity is less than one acre in size and the director or his designee has determined the activity will have no significant impact on another property or an environmentally sensitive area due to internal drainage or other site conditions that limit the potential impacts of runoff from the proposed activity. 
Note- Only ordinance requirements that address potential impacts from a proposed storm water discharge would be eligible for this exemption. Examples of requirements that may still apply to a newly constructed building include drainage easements, setbacks, basement/ground water separation, and other site drainage or flood prevention standards. 
c.  Site conditions. It is impracticable to meet the requirement due to site conditions such as slopes, soils, proximity to existing structures or desirable trees, limited site dimensions, surrounding land uses, the potential for ground water contamination, public health or safety problems, or other factors beyond the control of the applicant. No site shall be entitled to an exemption under this paragraph due solely to the size of the proposed land development activity in relation to the parcel size. However, the director or his designee shall provide special consideration in granting exemptions under this paragraph for the following sites:

(Ord. No. 386, § 1(3), 6-2-1992) 
Sec. 18.118. - Survey of state regulations. 
(a)  This section gives a brief survey of current laws and regulations having statewide application which deal with peddlers and transient merchants. 
Note. A seller of goods would have to obtain both a peddler's and a transient merchant's license if he engaged in both kinds of sales methods. See 37 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 360 (1948). 
(b)  Peddlers are governed by Wis. Stats. § 440.81, which provides for the licensing of peddlers; licensing fees are required; license must be obtained each year from the Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing; no license is required of one selling any agricultural product which he has grown in Wisconsin. For violations, notify the department of regulation and licensing, the local district attorney and the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Office of Consumer Protection. 
(c)  Transient merchants are governed by Wis. Stats. § 440.85, which provides for licensing of transient merchants; licensing fees are required; license must be obtained each year from the department of regulation and licensing; a $100.00 fee must be paid to the clerk-treasurer for each day that he is engaged in such business. 
Note. The $100.00 a day provision may be extremely burdensome to a merchant who does a low volume of business and thus may be open to a constitutional challenge on due process or restraint of commerce grounds. Some municipalities have seen fit to tie the fee to a percentage of the dollar volume of business in order to treat the low-volume merchant fairly. 
In case of violations, notify the department of regulation and licensing, the district attorney and the department of justice's office of consumer protection. 
(d)  Peddlers and transient merchants are governed by Wis. Stats. § 440.87, which permits most local governing bodies to further license peddlers and transient merchants. In case of violations, notify the city attorney regarding violations of village ordinances. 
(e)  The Wis. Admin. Code ch. ATCP 127 states that if a peddler's or a transient merchant's goods or services are primarily for personal, family or household purposes, he is required to disclose certain information to prospective buyers and is prohibited from engaging in certain unfair or deceptive trade practices. For example, every seller must give a written receipt if something is bought. For violations, notify the district attorney, the department of justice's office of consumer protection, or the department of agriculture's trade division. 
Note. Copies of Wis. Admin. Code ch. ATCP 127 can be obtained from the department of agriculture, and can be found in the Wisconsin Administrative Code.

Legal, nonconforming uses may not be extended, expanded, enlarged or intensified except as provided for hereunder. 
(3)  Upon petition to and approval of the plan commission, such legal, nonconforming use may be changed to another use provided the plan commission determined the new use would not result in a greater degree of nonconformity and provided further, that such new use shall thereafter determine the degree of legal, nonconformity. 
(4)  Where the structure, building, premises or fixture is damaged or structural repairs are necessary to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current, local, fair market value as determined by the Village of Pewaukee Assessor, it shall not be restored for use except in conformity of the regulations of the district in which it is located.

Prior to exercising such discretion, the plan commission shall make a specific finding that the development or redevelopment is consistent with the general architectural character, size and proportion of existing buildings in the neighborhood of the development or redevelopment and that permitting the deviation from the existing B5 standards will not adversely impact the public health, safety or welfare.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-04, § 1, adopted Mar. 18, 2014, repealed the former Div. 22, §§ 40.385-40.394, and enacted a new Div. 22 as set out herein. The former Div. 22 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2008-08, § 1(Att.), adopted Nov. 18, 2008. 

Sec. 40.385. - Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose, title and general provisions. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and the requirements in Wis. Stats. § 87.30. 
(b)  Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare, and tax base. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. This division is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  Title. This division shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village of Pewaukee, Wisconsin. 
(e)  General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. This division regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the PIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see section 40.392, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the village administrator, Village of Pewaukee. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
a.  Official maps: Based on the FIS. 
1.  Community Number 550489; Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0181G, 55133C0182G, 55133C0183G, 55133C0184G, 55133C0201G, and 55133C0203G dated November 5, 2014; with the corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (PIS) dated November 5, 2014, Volume number 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C and 55133CV003C and as may be amended or updated from time to time with these maps on file in the office of the village clerk/treasurer and shall be considered an addenda to this Code. 
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
b.  Official maps: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development. 
1.  Pewaukee Lake Dam Failure Analysis, Village of Pewaukee, Waukesha County, WI, prepared by Hey and Associates, Inc., October 14, 2004. Approved by WI DNR on January 11, 2005. 
2.  Waukesha County Flood Storage District, Panels 3 and 5 of 12, dated November 5, 2014. Prepared by the WDNR. Approved by the WDNR. 
(3)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows: 
a.  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
c.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
d.  The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs a. or b. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 40.392, Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 40.391(3)c. and the criteria in a. and b. below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 40.392, Amendments. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this division shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 40.392. 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this division shall be in compliance with the terms of this division, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022, applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This division supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; or Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This division is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this division, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this division derives or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this division. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this division are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This division does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This division does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this division. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this division be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. 
(13)  General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this division and all other requirements in section 40.391(1)b. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages.

    Increase in regional flood height. A calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, equal to or greater than 0.00 foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge. 
    Land use. Any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (Also see Development.) 
    Lowest adjacent grade. Elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3. 
    Maintenance. The act or process of restoring to original soundness, including redecorating, refinishing, non structural repairs, or the replacement of existing fixtures, systems or equipment with equivalent fixtures, systems or structures. 
    Manufactured home. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.

    Regional flood. A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Unnecessary hardship. Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance. 
    Variance. An authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watershed. The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Water surface profile. A graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

Secs. 40.395-40.400. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 24. - FC FLOODPLAIN CONSERVANCY DISTRICT 

Sec. 40.401. - Purpose. 
    The FC floodplain conservancy district is intended to preserve in essentially open space and natural uses lands which are unsuitable for intensive urban development due to poor natural soil conditions and periodic flood inundations. The proper regulation of these areas will serve to maintain and improve water quality, prevent flood damage, protect wildlife habitat, and prohibit the location of structures on soil which are generally not suitable for such use. In delineating the FC district, consideration shall be given to the maintenance of flood storage capacity and preventing significant increase in the flood discharges identified in the Village of Pewaukee's flood insurance study. Significant increases are those which result in a rise in the regional flood profile of 0.01 foot or greater. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.11(4)(a), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.402. - Principal uses. 
    Principal uses in the FC district shall include:

(2)  Open space and related uses may be permitted for the following uses provided that the applicant shows that such use or improvement will not impede drainage, will not cause ponding, will not obstruct the floodway, will not increase flood flow velocities, will not increase the flood stage and will not retard the movement of floodwaters. All floodproofed structures shall be securely anchored to protect them from larger floods. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the village administrator and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths and other factors associated with the 100-year recurrence interval flood. 
a.  Navigational structures. 
b.  Public water measuring and control facilities. 
c.  Bridges and approaches. 
d.  Marinas. 
e.  Filling as authorized by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to permit the establishment of approved bulkhead lines. 
f.  Other open space uses consistent with the purpose and intent of the district and compatible with uses in adjacent districts, not including structures. 
(3)  Municipal water supply and sanitary sewage collection systems provided that the system is floodproofed to an elevation of at least two feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval flood, and is designed to eliminate or minimize infiltration of floodwaters into the system. All floodproofed utilities shall be anchored to prevent flotation.

(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.11(4)(h), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.409. - Amendments to the FC district boundary. 
    The Village of Pewaukee board shall not permit changes to the FC district boundaries that are inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Code or in conflict with the applicable rules and regulations of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition: 
(1)  Changes in the FC district boundaries shall not be permitted where the change will increase the flood stage elevation by 0.01 foot or more, unless the petitioner has made appropriate legal arrangements with all affected units of government and all property owners affected by the stage increase. In no event shall a change be permitted that would increase the flood stage elevation by more than 1.0 foot unless a waiver is granted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Petitions for FC district changes shall show the effects of the change within the associated floodfringe, and shall provide adjusted water surface profiles and adjusted floodland limits to reflect the increased flood elevations. 
(2)  Removal of land from any floodland district shall not be permitted unless the land has been filled to an elevation at least two feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval flood and further provided that such land is contiguous to lands lying outside of the floodlands. 
(3)  Amendment of floodlands which were delineated by approximate methods shall not be permitted unless the petitioner provides the village with engineering data showing the flood profile, necessary river cross sections, flood elevations and any effect the establishment of a floodway/floodfringe will have on flood stages. The effects shall be limited as set forth in subsection (1) of this section for changes. If the approximate flood zone is less than five acres in area, and where the cost of the proposed development is estimated to be less than $125,000.00, the department of natural resources (DNR) will assist the petitioner in determining the required flood elevations. 
(4)  No river or stream shall be altered or relocated until a floodland zoning change has been applied for and granted in accordance with the requirements of the section, and until all adjacent communities have been requested to review and comment on the proposed alteration or relocation. The floodcarrying capacity of the altered or relocated watercourse shall not be reduced to less than the floodcarrying capacity before the watercourse was altered or relocated. 
(5)  Notice to DNR and FEMA. A copy of all notices for amendments or rezoning in the floodland districts shall be transmitted to the DNR and FEMA at least ten days prior to the public hearing. No amendments to the floodland district boundaries or regulations shall become effective until approved by the DNR. In the case of floodland district boundary changes, an official letter of map amendment from the FEMA may also be required. 
(6)  Additional administrative requirements are subject to sections 40.131-40.145 and 40.117-40.123.

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-08, § 1, adopted Aug. 5, 2014, supplied provisions to be added to this Code as §§ 40.410-40.412. In order to preserve the existing numbering system, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have redesignated as §§ 40.409.1-40.409.5 to read as set out herein. 

Sec. 40.409.1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, statement of purpose and title. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stat. §§ 61.35 and 61.353. 
(b)  Finding of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of shorelands and pollution of the navigable waters of the Village of Pewaukee would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
(1)  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
(2)  Limit certain land use activities detrimental to shorelands; and 
(3)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by controlling the location of structures in shoreland areas and restricting the removal of natural shoreland vegetation. 
(Ord. No. 2014-08, § 1(40.410), 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 40.409.2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Compliance. The use of shorelands within the shoreland area of the village shall be in full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a building and/or use permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this division. 
(b)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. 
(c)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This division supersedes all the provisions of any other applicable municipal ordinance except that where another municipal ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(2)  This division is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(d)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the village and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes or Wisconsin Constitution. 
(e)  Severability. Should any portion of this division be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this division shall not be affected. 
(f)  Applicability of shoreland district regulations. The shoreland zoning district regulations apply only to the following shorelands: 
(1)  A shoreland that was annexed by the Village of Pewaukee after May 7, 1982, and that prior to annexation was subject to a county shoreland zoning ordinance under Wis. Stat. § 59.692; and 
(2)  District boundaries. The shoreland district areas regulated by this division shall include all the lands (referred to herein as shorelands) in the Village of Pewaukee that are: 
a.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Surface Water Data viewer available on the DNR website, or are shown on United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps. 
b.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary highwater mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as continuous waterways or intermittent waterways on United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps. Flood hazard boundary maps, flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary-floodway maps, county soil survey maps or other existing county floodplain zoning maps shall be used to delineate floodplain areas. 
c.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary highwater mark location shall initially be made by the village administrator. When questions arise, the village administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of navigability or ordinary highwater mark. 
d.  Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 61.353(7), the shoreland zoning district does not include lands adjacent to an artificially constructed drainage ditch, pond, or retention basin if the drainage ditch, pond or retention basin is not hydrologically connected to a natural navigable water body. 
*A map titled "Village of Pewaukee Lands Annexed from 1982 and Thereafter" shall be considered the guide as to inventory of properties potentially affected by this local shoreland zoning regulation to the extent that these identified annexed lands meet the definition of "Shoreland." 
(g)  Effect of existing land division, sanitary, zoning and other regulations. The lands within the shoreland zoning district are subject to all applicable provisions of the Village of Pewaukee Code. Where the provisions of this division are more restrictive than other regulations in the Village Code, the provisions of this division shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2014-08, § 1(40.411), 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 40.409.3. - Setbacks from the water. 
(a)  Principal building setbacks. 
(1)  All principal buildings shall be set back at least 50 feet from the ordinary high-water mark.

a.  The principal building is constructed or placed on a lot or parcel of land that is immediately adjacent on each side to a lot or parcel of land containing a principal building; and 
b.  The principal building is constructed or placed within a distance equal to the average setback of the principal building on the adjacent lots or 35 feet from the ordinary high-water mark, whichever distance is greater. 
(Ord. No. 2014-08, § 1(40.412), 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 40.409.4. - Vegetative buffer zone. 
    Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 61.353(3), a landowner must maintain a vegetative buffer zone, as follows: 
(1)  A person who owns shoreland property that contains vegetation must maintain that vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone along the entire shoreline of the property and extending 35 feet inland from the ordinary high-water mark of the navigable water, except as provided in subsection (2). 
(2)  If the vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or diseased vegetation, the owner of the shoreland property may remove the vegetation, except that if the owner removes all of the vegetation in the vegetative buffer zone, the owner shall establish a vegetative buffer zone with new vegetation. 
(3)  A person who is required to maintain or establish a vegetative buffer zone under subsection (1) may remove all of the vegetation in a part of that zone in order to establish a viewing or access corridor that is no greater than 30 feet wide for every 100 feet of shoreline frontage and extends no more than 35 feet inland from the ordinary high-water mark. 
(Ord. No. 2014-08, § 1(40.412), 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 40.409.5. - Definitions. 
    In this division:

(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.03(2)(g), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.417. - Lot area and dimension. 
(a)  Determining lot area. For the purpose of this article, the lot area shall be measured from the base setback line and shall be exclusive of the area ultimately to be included in the street between the base setback line and the existing property line. 
(b)  Determining minimum average lot width. Average lot width shall be calculated as the average horizontal distance between the side lot lines of the lot. The lot width at the building setback line shall be greater than or equal to the required lot width. Questions of interpretation shall be made by Village of Pewaukee staff. 
(c)  No reduction less than required. No lot area shall be reduced by any means so as to create a lot of less than the required size or where the offsets, setbacks, open space or lot area would be reduced below that required by the regulations for the district in which such lot is located, except as provided by appeal in accordance with section 17.19(5) [40.131 et seq.]. 
(d)  Contiguous parcels. When two or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate area and/or dimension to accommodate a permitted use under the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located, are contiguous and are held in one ownership, the planning commission may require that they be combined into one parcel by certified survey map. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.03(3), 5-4-1999)

    Except in the case of a condominium, multifamily development, approved guest house or approved construction of speculative homes prior to final subdivision plat approval, not more than one principal detached residential building shall be located on a residential zoning lot, nor shall a detached residential building be located on the same zoning lot with any other principal buildings. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.03(4), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.419. - Building and structure location. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of regulating building and structure location is as follows: 
(1)  To require the provision of a buffer zone between noise-intolerant land uses (e.g., residences, nursing homes, day care centers, schools, churches) and adjacent streets or highways to effectively attenuate noise and buffer such developments from the pollution and hazards attendant to vehicular traffic. 
(2)  To require the provision of adequate physical separation between uses to minimize conflict. 
(3)  To allow exposure to optimum amounts of light, air and ventilation. 
(4)  To attenuate noise, odors, fumes and dust generated by land use before they infringe upon adjacent land use. 
(5)  To provide aesthetic open space of sufficient size to accommodate landscaping and to soften, complement and enhance architectural design of buildings, parking areas, loading facilities and utilities. 
(6)  To provide adequate area for snow piling. 
(7)  To ensure adequate separation between pedestrian and vehicular circulation. 
(8)  To promote cluster development and other internally oriented living, shopping and working environments, and to discourage strip development. 
(9)  To provide adequate area to detain, retain and facilitate surface drainage. 
(10)  To protect and preserve the quality and quantity of groundwater resources. 
(11)  To prevent development which may result in unacceptable non-point source pollution. 
(12)  To provide diversified and balanced growth. 
(b)  Base setback line. The following base setback lines are hereby established parallel to the centerline of all public streets and highways: 
(1)  For all Village of Pewaukee roads, the base setback line shall be located 30 feet from the centerline of such street or 65 feet from the center point of a cul-de-sac unless otherwise specifically established by action of the village board. 
(2)  For all streets and highways, other than those designated as local streets, a base setback line shall be located at a distance from the centerline of such street or highway equal to half the width of its ultimate right-of-way as established by the village board. 
(3)  The width of frontage roads shall not be included in the rights-of-way designated in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
(c)  Setbacks. Unless otherwise specified within an individual zoning district or in accordance with sections 40.131-40.145, no building or structure shall be erected, constructed, structurally altered or relocated on a lot closer to the base setback line than the minimum setback distance specified in the established zoning district. 
(1)  Frontage roads, service drives and parking areas setback. Frontage roads, service drives, parking areas, etc., shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the adjacent base setback line. 
(d)  Setback exceptions: 
(1)  Additions to existing structures which lack the required setback may be allowed if the addition is set back at a distance greater than or equal to the average of the existing building setback and required setback. 
(2)  On corner lots, on record as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the effect of the setback regulations shall not reduce the buildable width of such corner lot to less than 30 feet. 
(3)  Detached residential garages with vehicular access to an alley may be allowed a setback reduction to ten feet from the edge of the alley right-of-way. 
(e)  Offsets. The proximity of any portion of a building to the side or rear lot lines shall be regulated by offset provisions as follows: 
(1)  No building shall be erected, structurally altered or relocated so that any roofed or enclosed portion thereof is closer to any lot line than the offset distance specified by the regulations for the district in which it is located except as follows: 
a.  In the case of any lot of record which has a minimum average width less than that required by the district in which it is located, the offset from a side lot line may be reduced proportionally to the ratio of the actual minimum average width and the required minimum average width (i.e., actual width/required width) provided, however, that no offset shall in any case be less than five feet. 
b.  Where a lot abuts a district boundary line, the offset from such line in the district of less restrictive use shall not be less than that required for the district of more restrictive use. 
c.  The required offset area on one property may be reduced if the offset area on the adjoining property is increased by deed restriction to include the required offset area plus the equivalent amount of offset area resulting from the adjacent reduction. 
d.  In the case of attached single-family, row, multifamily, commercial or industrial use structures, two or more buildings on adjoining lots may be erected with common or directly adjoining walls provided the requirements of the State of Wisconsin industrial code relative to such construction are complied with and provided that at both ends of such row type buildings the applicable offset requirements shall be complied with. 
e.  For any single-family residential principal dwelling structure (and including any attached appurtenance thereto such as, for instance, decks, porches, balconies, [etc.]) with frontage on Pewaukee Lake, which property has neighboring existing principal residential structures on each of the adjoining parcels and which adjoining principal residential structures are both within 200 feet of the proposed new or modified principal residential structure, the minimum required offset from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) of the lake to such new or modified principal residential dwelling structure may be reduced to the average of the lake offsets of the two adjoining principal residential dwelling structures but in no case shall the lake offset be less than 35 feet. 
(2)  Any required offset area shall be landscaped and kept clean and free from the accumulation of debris or refuse, and shall not be used for the storage or display of equipment, products, vehicles or any other material. 
(f)  Driveway offsets. Residential driveways shall be located no closer than five feet to a side or rear property line (three feet for cul-de-sac driveways) unless written approval is granted by the adjacent property owner.

g.  Fences. The fencing requirement shall be applicable to all private swimming pools, including those constructed before enactment of this section. 
1.  Every private swimming pool shall be completely surrounded by a fence or wall not less than four feet in height, but not to exceed six feet in height, be of sufficient strength to prevent accidental access, and shall be constructed so as not to have openings, holes or gaps larger than four inches in any one dimension, which would allow ease of access by unauthorized persons, except for doors or gates. A dwelling house or accessory building may be used as part of such enclosure. All gates or doors shall be equipped with an inside self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or door securely closed at all times when not in actual use, except that the door of any dwelling which forms a part of the enclosure need not be so equipped. 
2.  A temporary fence (snow fence, etc.) can be used while said pool is under construction. A permanent fence must be constructed within 30 days after water is in the pool. 
3.

(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.03(9), 5-4-1999) 
DIVISION 2. - OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 40.424. - Traffic visibility requirements. 
    No obstructions greater than three feet in height, except necessary street signs and public utility lines, shall be permitted within the 50-foot vision triangle space of intersecting road rights-of-way (i.e., base setback lines). 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.15(1), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.425. - Loading requirements. 
(a)  No building for business or institutional purposes shall be erected on a lot in a manner requiring servicing directly from the abutting public street. 
(b)  The use of public streets for the maneuvering of trucks to service business or institutional buildings is expressly prohibited. Sufficient on-site space shall be provided for such maneuvering. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.15(2), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.426. - Parking requirements. 
(a)  Approval. All business, institutional, park, multifamily residential and industrial parking areas which are constructed, reconstructed, expanded or extended subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall obtain approval of the proposed parking site plan by the Village of Pewaukee planning commission. 
(b)  Adequate access. Driveways shall be at least 20 feet wide for business, institutional, park, multifamily residential and industrial uses. 
(c)  Location. Parking shall be located on the same lot as the principal use unless the plan commission specifically approves of parking located on an adjoining parcel with the recording of appropriate access, parking and maintenance easements/agreements. 
(d)  Dimensional requirement. Parking spaces, driveways and aisles for access to spaces shall have the following minimum dimensions unless specifically varied by the plan commission: 
Stall width .....  9 feet Stall depth ..... 18 feet Parking aisle width: Two-way traffic (90;deg;) ..... 25 feet One-way traffic (60;deg;) ..... 18 feet Driveway (no parking stalls): Two-way traffic ..... 22 feet One-way traffic ..... 12 feet  
(e)  Parking spaces for use by physically disabled persons. Parking for physically disabled persons shall be in accordance with State of Wisconsin and federal regulations. 
(f)  Surfacing. All off-street parking areas and driveways, except parking areas accessory to single-family and two-family dwellings, shall be surfaced with a bituminous or Portland cement concrete. Such parking areas shall be graded to appropriately drain all surface waters and shall be kept free of dust, loose stones and gravel. Additionally, parking areas shall be arranged and marked to provide orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles and must be completed within one year of building permit issuance. 
(g)  Flexibility in application. The village recognizes that, due to the particulars of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in this section may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations on adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, the planning commission may allow deviations from the requirements of this section whenever it finds that the deviation will not adversely impact traffic circulation or public safety. 
(h)  Space to be set aside for reduced parking. The number of required parking stalls for a proposed use may be reduced by the plan commission and replaced with open space upon a finding that the use does not necessitate such required parking. Such open space shall be in addition to required open space requirements. Sufficient open space shall be provided which, if converted to parking spaces in the future, would provide off-street parking to meet the full requirements of this chapter at the time of application. 
(i)  Changes in occupancy or intensity of use. When the parking needs of a building, structure or site are increased due to additional employees, expanded gross floor area, expanded seating capacity or change of occupancy, additional parking spaces shall be provided in the amount necessary to conform to this chapter. 
(j)  Required number of stalls. The following parking standards shall be applied unless deviations have been specifically approved by the planning commission: 
(1)  Residential uses. 
a.  Single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings. Two spaces per dwelling unit (excluding garages). 
b.  Multifamily dwellings. 
1.  One bedroom = 1.75 enclosed parking spaces per unit. 
2.  Two bedrooms = 2.0 enclosed parking spaces per unit. 
3.  Three bedrooms = 2.0 enclosed parking spaces per unit. 
4.  Guest parking requires one parking stall for every two units. 
c.  Housing for the elderly. Subject to planning commission approval on a case by case basis.

DIVISION 3. - SITE AND STRUCTURE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, PARK, INSTITUTIONAL AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 40.443. - Purpose 
    This division is intended to promote compatible development; stabilize property values; foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community as a place to live and work; preserve the character and quality of the built and natural environment; and raise the level of community expectations for the quality of its environment. This division applies to commercial, industrial, institutional, park and multifamily residential development. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.14(1), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.444. - Findings. 
(a)  The Village of Pewaukee board finds that: 
(1)  Trees and shrubs are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival; 
(2)  Trees and shrubs appreciably reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe; 
(3)  Trees and shrubs transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems; 
(4)  Trees and shrubs have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers; 
(5)  Trees and shrubs, through their root system, stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control and flood control; 
(6)  Trees and shrubs are an invaluable physical, aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas; 
(7)  Trees and shrubs have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values; 
(8)  Screening between two lots lessens the transmission of noise, dust and glare from one lot to another; 
(9)  Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Even minimum screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can entirely shield one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use. Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening; 
(10)  Establishing and maintaining architectural standards will tend to maintain a high character of community development and protect real estate from impairment and destruction of value; 
(11)  Architectural standards will tend to prevent or minimize discordant and unsightly surroundings; 
(12)  Architectural standards will protect and perpetuate a pleasant and inviting view for the enjoyment, environmental and cultural enrichment of the citizens of the community and its visitors; 
(13)  Architectural standards will foster civic pride in the beauty of the community and enhance the community's aesthetic and economic vitality; 
(14)  The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.14(2), 5-4-1999)

(a)  Any division of land within the Village of Pewaukee shall be surveyed and a plat approved and recorded pursuant to this chapter and Wis. Stats. ch. 236, where: 
(1)  The act of division creates five or more parcels or, building sites of 11/2 acres each or less in area; or 
(2)  Five or more parcels or building sites of 11/2 acres each or less in area are created by successive divisions within a period of five years. 
(b)  Any declaration of condominium or amended declaration for expansion purposes, affecting property within the village shall be reviewed and the condominium plat approved and recorded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and Wis. Stats. ch. 703. 
(c)  Any division or combination of land other than a subdivision or condominium within the village shall be surveyed and a certified survey map of such division approved and recorded as required by this chapter. 
(d)  No parcel of land may be divided where public sanitary sewer is unavailable or where soil conditions preclude the installation of approved private (i.e., on-site) sewage disposal systems unless the divided parcels are deed restricted to uses which do not require a private (i.e., on-site) sewage disposal facility. A holding tank may only be installed to replace an existing or failing mound or septic system, or as the only reasonable alternative for serving an existing platted lot, or for land divisions supporting business development upon a finding by the village that a public sanitary sewer is not reasonably available. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.16(2), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.451. - Administration. 
    The Village of Pewaukee administrator, or his designee, is designated to administer and enforce this article and as such is assigned the following duties: 
(1)  Advise engineers, subdividers, land dividers and the public regarding standards and general provisions of this article. 
(2)  Review all plats as to compliance with the requirements of this article, good subdivision and condominium design criteria and the provisions of the official master plan. 
(3)  Act as advisor, technical administrator and coordinator to the planning commission regarding plat review and approval. 
(4)  Notify the plan commission, village board and village attorney whenever the provisions of this article are violated and advise them to withhold necessary approval of proposed land divisions, condominiums and subdivisions pending such compliance. 
(5)  In accordance with Wis. Stats. ch. 236, transmit the required copies of preliminary and final subdivision plats to the appropriate Waukesha County and State of Wisconsin agencies. 
(Ord. No. 99-5, § 17.16(3), 5-4-1999) 
Sec. 40.452. - Processing procedures for subdivision and condominium development. 
(a)  Pre-application consultation. Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider should consult with the Village of Pewaukee's staff in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the master plan and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning their development. In so doing, both the subdivider and staff may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will therefore gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(b)  Concept approval. The subdivider shall submit ten copies of the proposed concept plan. Concept approval shall not be viewed or construed as a vested right in the development but, rather, a general indication that the proposed development conceptually complies with this chapter and the master plan and that the planning commission is willing to review and act upon the more detailed plans for the proposed development. A concept plan shall be based upon a survey by a registered land surveyor and prepared at a map scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch and shall show correctly on its face the following information: 
(1)  Title or name under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded. Such title shall not be the same or similar to a previously approved and recorded plat, unless it is an addition to a previously recorded plat and is so stated on the plat. 
(2)  Property location of the proposed subdivision by address or adjacent address, government lot, quarter section, township, range, county and state. 
(3)  General location sketch showing the location of the subdivision within the U.S. Public Land Survey section. 
(4)  Date, graphic scale and north arrow. 
(5)  Names and addresses of the owner, subdivider and land surveyor preparing the plat. 
(6)  Entire area contiguous to the proposed plat owned or controlled by the subdivider shall be included on the preliminary plat even though only a portion of such area is proposed for immediate development. The planning commission may waive this requirement where it is unnecessary to fulfill the purposes and intent of this article and severe hardship would result from strict application thereof. 
(7)  Dimensions of proposed lot lines. 
(8)  Area of proposed lots. 
(9)  Footprint of buildable area of each lot. 
(10)  General illustration of existing and proposed landscaping. 
(11)  Identification of existing and proposed streams, ponds, lakes, wetland and floodplains. 
(12)  Existing zoning on and adjacent to the proposed subdivision. 
(13)  Distance from proposed driveway to existing driveway openings either adjacent to, or across the street from, the proposed site. 
(14)  Designation of existing zoning district classification on adjacent and opposite fronting properties. 
(c)  Development agreement recommendation and approval. 
(1)  Following concept approval, village staff shall prepare a draft development agreement which specifies the physical improvements and fees which the developer is required to install and pay, respectively. The development agreement should not be viewed or construed as a vested right in the development but, rather, an agreement between the village and developer regarding the engineering and construction requirements of the proposed development. 
(2)  The draft development agreement shall be submitted to the planning commission for recommendation. The planning commission shall, within 45 days of reviewing the development agreement, recommend approval, recommend disapproval or recommend conditional approval of the development agreement to the village board. 
(3)  Following planning commission recommendation the village board shall, within 45 days of receiving the development agreement, resolve to approve, reject or conditionally approve the development agreement. 
(4)  The village engineer may require the submittal of preliminary plans and profiles for proposed water, storm and sanitary sewer systems, streets, grading and drainage prior to the preparation of the development agreement and submittal of the preliminary plat. Additionally, the village engineer may require the submittal of traffic and environmental analysis if deemed appropriate. 
(5)  If the developer fails to commence construction within six months of development agreement approval, then the development agreement shall become null and void. 
(d)  Preliminary plat approval. 
(1)  The developer shall prepare a preliminary plat in accordance with Wis. Stats. ch. 236 and the requirements listed in subsection (d)(5) of this section. Following, or concurrent with, development agreement processing and within 90 days of receiving the plat, the planning commission shall approve, reject or conditionally approve the preliminary plat. Failure of the planning commission to act within 90 days shall constitute an approval of the plat as filed unless the review period is extended by mutual consent. 
(2)  If the final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any conditions of that approval, it is entitled to approval. If the final plat is not submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat, any approving authority may refuse to approve the final plat. The final plat may, if permitted by the approving authority, constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat that the subdivider proposes to record at that time. The preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat which will be subject to further consideration by the planning commission at the time of its submission. 
(3)  Within two normal working days after a preliminary plat is submitted for approval, the village clerk, or his designee, shall transmit appropriate copies to appropriate Waukesha County and State of Wisconsin agencies required to review the plat. 
(4)  Village approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat shall be based on compliance with platting requirements, village ordinance requirements, the master plan and a review of the proposed developments' impact on the village's streets, sewage system, drainage system, environmental resources and other public health, safety and welfare concerns. If the proposed development impact is interpreted by the planning commission to be significant, the planning commission may reject the plat or require appropriate and necessary mitigation of the impact. 
(5)  A preliminary plat shall show the following: 
a.  Exact length and bearing of the exterior boundaries of the proposed subdivision referenced to a corner established in U.S. Public Land Survey and the total acreage encompassed thereby.

f.  Type, width and elevation of any existing street pavements within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto together with any legally established centerline elevations, all to mean sea level (1929) datum. 
g.  Location and names of any adjacent subdivisions, parks and cemeteries abutting unplatted lands. 
h.  Location, size and invert elevation of any existing sanitary or storm sewers, culverts and drain pipes and the location of manholes, catchbasins, hydrants, power and telephone poles and the location and size of any existing water and gas mains within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto. If no sanitary or storm sewers or water mains are located on or immediately adjacent to the lands being platted, the nearest such sewers or water mains which might be extended to serve such lands shall be indicated by their direction and distance from the nearest exterior boundary of the plat. Their size and invert elevations shall also be indicated. 
i.  Approximate dimensions of all proposed lots together with proposed lot and block numbers. 
j.  Location and approximate dimensions and size of any sites to be reserved or dedicated for parks, playgrounds, outlots and drainageways.

(f)  Final plat approval. 
(1)  Prior to final approval of the plat, the village engineer shall certify that all required improvements have been satisfactorily installed or, alternatively in certain circumstances as approved by the planning commission, the appropriate escrow account to satisfy future installation shall be established. 
(2)  The developer shall prepare a final plat in accordance with Wis. Stats. ch. 236. 
(3)  Within two normal working days after final plat is submitted for approval, the village clerk shall transmit copies to the appropriate state and county agencies required to review the plat, and to adjacent cities and/or villages having extraterritorial plat jurisdiction. 
(4)  If the final subdivision is not submitted within six months of the planning commission's preliminary plat approval date, the village may refuse to approve the final plat unless the time is extended by consent of the developer/land owner and village planning commission. 
(5)  The village planning commission shall, within 30 days of receiving the final plat, recommend approval or rejection of the plat and shall transmit its recommendations to the village board. 
(6)  The planning commission shall, at the time it recommends approval or rejection of a plat to the village board, give at least ten days' prior written notice of its recommendation to the clerk of any municipality within 1,000 feet of the plat. 
(7)  The village board shall approve or reject the plat within 60 days of its submission, unless the time is extended by agreement with the developer or official objections have been filed. 
Note: Generally, final plat approval shall not be requested by the developer/applicant until all terms and conditions of the development agreement have been complied with. Plats filed for final approval prior to such time may be rejected by the village clerk. 
(8)  After the final subdivision plat has been approved by the village board, and required improvements either installed or a contract and sureties guaranteeing their installation is filed, the village clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to such approval to be duly executed and shall record the plat with the county register of deeds. The register of deeds shall not record the plat unless it is offered within 30 days from the date of the last approval. 
(g)  The village administrator, in consultation with the village engineer and village planner may review, approve or reject a condominium instrument pursuant to the procedures set forth in Wis. Stats. § 703.115 as amended. Land development associated with a proposed condominium shall, however, comply with the procedural, technical, and engineering standards identified in chapter 40, article X of the Village Code of Ordinances.

Sec. 40.453. - Processing procedure for minor land divisions and/or property line realignments. 
(a)  A property owner shall apply for certified survey map approval when proposing realignment of their property line (i.e., no land division created). Approval of certified survey maps for simple property realignments shall be subject only to appropriate Village of Pewaukee staff approval. 
(b)  A property owner/developer may apply for certified survey map approval of a minor land division if the following applies: 
(1)  A proposed land division of not more than four parcels; 
(2)  A proposed land division to divide any number of parcels greater than 11/2 acres in size, thus not constituting a subdivision as defined by State of Wisconsin and local regulation. 
(c)  The following process shall apply to proposed certified survey map approval applications for minor land divisions: 
(1)  Pre-application consultation. Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a certified survey map for a minor land division or property line realignment, the property owner/developer should consult with the village 's staff in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the property owner/developer of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the master plan and to otherwise assist the property owner/developer in planning their development. In so doing, both the property owner/developer and staff may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The property owner/developer will therefore gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(2)  Minor land division concept plan. The property owner shall have the option to submit ten copies of the proposed concept land division, drawn in accordance with the requirements of section 3.16(4)(b) [40.452(b)], to the village for concept approval of the planning commission. As an alternative, the applicant can proceed directly to final certified survey map approval if no development agreement is required. Concept approval shall not be viewed or construed as a vested right in the development but, rather, a general indication that the proposed development conceptually complies with this chapter and the master plan and that the planning commission is willing to review and act upon the final certified survey map for minor land division approval. 
(3)  Development agreement recommendation and approval. 
a.  If public improvements (i.e., public road, sewer and/or water improvements) are required as part of the land division development, village staff shall prepare a development agreement which specifies the physical improvements and fees which the developer is required to install and pay. The development agreement is an agreement between the village and developer regarding the engineering and construction requirements of the proposed development. 
b.  The draft development agreement shall be submitted to the planning commission for recommendation. The planning commission shall, within 30 days of reviewing the development agreement, recommend approval, recommend disapproval or recommend conditional approval of the development agreement to the village board. Following planning commission recommendation, the village board shall, within 30 days of receiving the development agreement, resolve to approve, reject or conditionally approve the development agreement. 
c.  The village engineer may require the submittal of preliminary plans and profiles for proposed water, storm and sanitary sewer systems, streets, grading and drainage prior to the preparation of the development agreement. Additionally, the village engineer may require submittal of traffic, groundwater and environmental analysis. 
d.  If the developer fails to commence construction within six months of development agreement approval, then the development agreement shall become null and void. 
(4)  Final certified survey map approval for minor land division. The planning commission shall approve, reject or conditionally approve the certified survey map based on compliance with village ordinance requirements, the village master plan, statutory requirements and after review of the proposed developments impact on the village 's streets, sewage system, drainage system and environmental resources. If the proposed development impact is interpreted by the planning commission to be significant, the planning commission may reject the plat or require appropriate and necessary mitigation of the impact. Additionally, the final certified survey shall dedicate the necessary road right-of-way as a condition of land division approval. In addition to statutory requirements, the certified survey map shall include the following information: 
a.  Existing and proposed contours at vertical intervals of not more than two feet (note: this data may be provided on a separate plan sheet). Elevations shall be marked on such contours based on National Geodetic Vertical Datum. 
b.  Water elevations of adjoining lakes and streams at the date of the survey and approximate high and low water elevations, all referred to National Geodetic Vertical Datum. 
c.  Floodway, floodfringe environmental corridor and wetland boundaries and the contour line lying in a vertical distance of two feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval flood or where such data is not available, five feet above the elevation of the maximum flood of record. 
d.  Location, right-of-way width and names of all existing streets, alleys or other public ways, easements, railroad and utility rights-of-way and all section and quarter section lines within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto. 
e.  Type, width and elevation of any existing street pavements within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto together with any legally established centerline elevations, all to mean sea level (1929) datum. 
f.  Location and names of any adjacent subdivisions, parks and cemeteries abutting unplatted lands. 
g.  Location, size and invert elevation of any existing sanitary or storm sewers, culverts and drain pipes and the location of manholes, catchbasins, hydrants, power and telephone poles and the location and size of any existing water and gas mains within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto. If no sanitary or storm sewers or water mains are located on or immediately adjacent to the lands being platted, the nearest such sewers or water mains which might be extended to serve such lands shall be indicated by their direction and distance from the nearest exterior boundary of the plat. Their size and invert elevations shall also be indicated. 
h.  Location and approximate dimensions and size of any sites to be reserved or dedicated for parks, playgrounds, outlots and drainageways. 
i.  Existing zoning of land adjacent to, and across from, the proposed subdivision. 
j.  Location of soil boring tests. The number of such tests shall be adequate to portray the character of the soil and the depths of bedrock and groundwater from the natural undisturbed surface (note: this information may be illustrated on a separate plan sheet). 
k.  Distance from proposed driveway to existing driveway openings either adjacent to, or across the street from, the proposed site. 
l.  Designation of existing zoning district classification on adjacent and opposite fronting properties. 
Additionally, any resulting remnant parcel less than 20 acres in size shall be illustrated in the certified survey map. Any resulting remnant parcel greater than 20 acres shall be illustrated on a separate plat of survey.

(d)  Provision for park and open space areas. The following regulations are intended to provide for the preservation and proper location of park, recreation and other public use areas to meet the needs of the expanding community because of the development of vacant lands; and to ensure that such provision is in appropriate proportion to the additional need created by the residential development: 
(1)  The residential developer shall be required to dedicate sufficient area to meet the proportionate park, recreation and general open space needs generated by the development. The dedication value shall be determined by the village assessor on the basis of full and fair market value of the land for the proposed public purpose. Such required, dedication shall not in any case represent land valued in excess of the amount required in accordance with the village's established fee schedule. In determining the number of lots for such computation, only the additional new and vacant lots created by the land division shall be counted. 
(2)  Where the dedication of lands is not feasible or compatible with the village's master plan, the developer may, at the discretion of the planning commission, satisfy the requirement for provision of such area by payment of park and open space fees in accordance with the village's established fee schedule. 
(3)  Park and open space monies received under this article shall be placed in a separate nonlapsing fund. 
(4)  Such monies shall be used exclusively for site acquisition. 
(5)  Payment shall be made to the village administrator, or his designee, prior to recording the final plat, certified survey map or prior to issuance of a multifamily residential building permit.

    The chief of police or any person specifically designated to act and acting on his/her behalf is authorized to remove or cause to remove any motor vehicle, semi trailer, mobile home or trailer that reasonably appears to be in violation of section 50.117 except that the removal of a motor vehicle, semi-trailer, mobile home or trailer in violation of section 50.117 may only be performed by or under the direction of a police officer or towing contractor under contract with the Village of Pewaukee. Said vehicle shall be impounded until lawfully claimed or disposed of as provided for hereunder except that if it is deemed by a duly authorized municipal representative, that the cost of towing and storage charges for the impoundment would exceed the value of the vehicle, the vehicle may be junked or sold by the village upon determination by the chief of police that the vehicle is not stolen or otherwise wanted for evidence or for other reasons. 
    If a motor vehicle, trailer, semi-trailer or mobile home on any public highway or public property is abandoned, such vehicle shall be removed to a suitable place of impoundment. Upon causing the removal and impoundment of the motor vehicle, the towing service which removed the vehicle shall be advised within 24 hours of the order of such removal of the name and last known address of the registered owner and all lien holders of record of the vehicle unless otherwise required under the terms of the towing contract with the village. 
    The owner of an abandoned vehicle, except a stolen vehicle, is responsible for the abandonment and all costs of impounding and disposing of the vehicle. Costs not recovered from the sale of the vehicle may be recovered in a civil action by the village against the owner. Whether or not the municipality recovers the cost of towing and enforcement, the village shall be responsible to the towing service for requisitional towing services and the reasonable charges for impoundment. Any vehicle which is deemed abandoned by a duly authorized representative of the village and not otherwise disposed of as provided for above shall be retained in storage for a minimum period of ten days after certified mail notice has been sent to the owner and lien holders of record to permit reclamation of the vehicle after payment of accrued charges. Such notice shall set forth the make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle, the place where the vehicle is being held and should inform the owner and any lien holders of their right to reclaim the vehicle. The notice shall state that the failure of the owner or lien holders to exercise their rights to reclaim the vehicle under this section shall be deemed a waiver of all right, title and interest in the vehicle and consent to the sale of the vehicle. Each retained vehicle not reclaimed by its owner or lien holder may be sold in a commercially reasonable matter.

At said sale the highest bid for any such motor vehicle shall be accepted unless the same is deemed inadequate by the chief of police, in which event all bids may be rejected. If all bids are rejected or no bid is received, the village may either re-advertise the sale or adjourn the sale to a definite date, sell the motor vehicle at a private sale or junk the vehicle. Any interested person may offer bids on each abandoned vehicle to be sold. The public notice shall be posted at the office of the village police department and notice of the intention to sell the vehicle shall be posted. The posting shall be in the same form as a certified mailing sent to the owner or lien holders of record. Upon sale of any abandoned vehicle, the village may supply the purchaser with a completed form designated by the department of transportation enabling the purchaser to obtain a regular certificate of title for the vehicle.

(Ord. No. 99-9, § 1, 11-11-1999) 
Sec. 54.132. - Sex offenders. 
(a)  Findings and intent. 
(1)  The Wisconsin legislature has provided for the punishment, treatment and supervision of persons convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children, including their release into the community. Indeed, Wis. Stats. ch. 980 provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons. The purpose of this section is to protect the public, to reduce the likelihood that convicted sex offenders will engage in such conduct in the future. 
The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is high, and when convicted sex offenders re-enter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. See Smith v. Doe, 538 US 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed. 2d 164 (2003) and McKune v. Lile, 536 US 24, 34, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), citing United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sex Offenses and Offenders, 27 (1997) U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (1997). 
The village board has reviewed research on sex offenders, including the findings of a number of states across the United States, including, but not limited to Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Iowa and California as they pertain to laws adopted and which relate to imposing restrictions on sex offenders with respect to residency; and in addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the 8 th Circuit Decision on Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700, 716 (8 th Cir. 2005) providing, in part, "the record does not support a conclusion that the Iowa General Assembly and the Governor acted based merely on negative attitudes toward or fear of, or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group (citations omitted). Sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism and the parties presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense. Even experts in the field could not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend, whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among those who "cross over" to offend against a younger child, or the degree to which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk of re-offense against children. One expert in the district court opined that it is just "common sense" that limiting the frequency of contact between sex offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of an offense (citations omitted). The policymakers of Iowa are entitled to employ such "common sense" and we are not persuaded that the means selected to pursue the state's legitimate interest are without rational basis". 
The board finds the negative consequences of failing to regulate the movement of sex offenders is a hazard to children and the community. Thus, the village has a duty and need to regulate where sex offenders reside and loiter within the village once they are reintegrated into the community. This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of the children in the Village of Pewaukee from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. It is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the village's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing residence; and by regulating certain activities that may be used by sexual offenders to prey on children. 
(2)  The village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools, day-care centers and other places children frequent. The village finds and declares that in addition to schools and day-care centers, children congregate or play at public parks. 
The board notes that Wis. Stats. § 61.34 authorizes the village board to enact legislation for the health, safety and welfare of the public. In addition, Wis. Stats. § 61.34(5) notes that the powers, rights and privileges accorded villages under said chapter are to be liberally construed in order to promote the general welfare, peace, good order and prosperity of the village. 
(3)  This section will not apply to sexually violent persons, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 980.01(7), because these persons are controlled under the regulations of Wis. Stats. ch. 980. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section and unless the context otherwise requires:

(2)  Measurement of distance. For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the restriction shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer property line of a school, licensed day-care center, park, trail, playground, place of worship or any other place designated by the village where children are known to congregate. The village clerk shall maintain an official map showing prohibited locations as defined by this section.

Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. 
(2)  Unless flight by an actor or other circumstances makes it impractical, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him or her to identify himself or herself or explain his or her presence and conduct at the aforementioned locations. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the actor was true, and, if believed by law enforcement at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. 
(3)  A designated offender does not commit a violation of loitering in a child safety zone as stated above and the enumerate uses may allow such person on the property supporting such use if any of the following apply:

Such appeal shall be made to the village clerk's office, who shall forward the request to the sex offender residency appeal board, which shall receive reports from the police department as to the criminal background of the applicant and the nature and circumstances of the underlying offense requiring the registration under Wis. Stats. § 301.45 or § 301.46. The board shall convene and shall hear from the applicant, as well as the police department or others who would be affected by this decision. The board shall consider the amount of time which has passed since the original offense was committed; whether there has been evidence of any re-offense; whether the applicant is employed and the duration of that employment; whether the applicant has shown remorse; whether there has been evidence of rehabilitation; and finally, any factors that would suggest a likelihood of re-offense. 
    The sex offender residency appeal board shall consist of five persons appointed by the village president and ratified by the village board. Each member shall be a resident of the village and up to three of those members may be members of the village board. 
    Members of the sex offender residency appeal board shall be subject to a criminal background check, and applicants for the board must consent to such a check being made. In the event the background check provides evidence of criminal convictions which are reasonably related to the performance of that person's duty on the sex offender residency appeal board such that there is a material question as to that person's ability to perform the duties on the sex offender residency appeal board, then such person may be prohibited from serving on that board. 
(j)  Violations and penalties. If a person violates subsection (c), above, by establishing a residence or occupying residential premises within 750 feet of those premises as described therein, without any exception(s) as also set forth above, the village attorney, upon referral from the chief of police and the written determination by the chief of police that upon all of the facts and circumstances and the purpose of this chapter such residence occupancy presents an activity or use of property that interferes substantially with the comfortable enjoyment of life, health or safety of another or others, shall bring an action in the name of the village in the circuit court for Waukesha County to permanently enjoin such residency as a public nuisance. If a person violates subsections (c) and (g), in addition to the aforesaid injunctive relief, such person shall be subject to the general penalty provisions set forth under section 1.102 of the Municipal Code. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. In addition, the village may undertake all other legal and equitable remedies to prevent or remove a violation of this section.

(c)  As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed. 
(d)  When there have been similar complaints made or where there exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the village, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the village shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the following information: 
(1)  The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests; 
(2)  What system component was tested; 
(3)  The equipment used and procedures employed in testing; 
(4)  The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; and 
(5)  Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required. 
(e)  The village may require that tests be supervised by an independent professional engineer or equivalent of the village's choice. The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the village such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove that the grantee failed to meet the technical standards, the grantee shall bear the cost of the test. If the test should prove that the grantee met the technical standards, the village shall bear the cost of the test. 
(f)  The village's right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.26. - Grantee rules and regulations. 
    The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this franchise and to assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.27. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Since the streets of the village to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the village are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the village at great expense to its taxpayers, and since the grant to the grantee to the streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the village an amount equal to five percent of the grantee's gross revenues from the operations of the grantee within the confines of the village or contract area. If the statutory five percent limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the franchise fee may be subject to renegotiation. 
(b)  This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the village by the grantee. 
(c)  The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar-year basis to the village within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of gross revenues in such form as established between the village and the grantee. 
(d)  The village shall have the right to inspect the grantee's books and records and the right to audit and to recomputed any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for any calendar year; provided, however, that any such audit shall take place within 24 months following the close of a particular calendar year. Any additional amount due to the village as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the village, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
(e)  If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the legal maximum rate charged by the United States Internal Revenue Service for late tax payments, and the grantee shall reimburse the village for any additional expenses and costs incurred by the village by reason of the delinquent payment(s). 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.28. - Transfer of control or controlling interest. 
(a)  Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, a franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet or mortgaged in any manner, n or shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the village. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee, and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, provided that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the village and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the village. The village shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within 120 days following receipt of written notice and the necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public unless the requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village shall not unreasonably withhold such consent to the proposed transfer. 
(b)  Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, the grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control or controlling interest of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the village may inquire into the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the village in such inquiry. 
(c)  The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this franchise. 
(d)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village will not approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(e)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control or an assignment of the franchise be approved without the successor in interest or the assignee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.29. - Availability of books and records. 
(a)  The grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times, and the village shall have the right to inspect, where reasonably necessary to the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the system, at any time during normal business hours, provided that where volume and convenience necessitate, the grantee may require inspection to take place on the grantee's premises. 
(b)  The following records and/or reports are to be made available to the village upon request, but no more frequently than once on an annual basis unless mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the village: 
(1)  A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by the grantee to the village; 
(2)  Periodic preventive maintenance reports; 
(3)  Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies; 
(4)  Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or complaints periodically; and 
(5)  Periodic construction update reports, including, where appropriate, the submission of as-built maps. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007)

    Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports either submitted by the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting the system authorized pursuant to the franchise or received from such agencies shall be provided to the village upon request. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007)

Sec. 88.32. - Removal of cable television system. 
    At the expiration of the term for which a franchise is granted and any renewal denied, or upon its termination as provided herein, the grantee shall forthwith, upon notice by the village, remove at its own expense all designated portions of the cable television system from all streets and public property within the village. If the grantee fails to do so, the village may perform the work at the grantee's expense. Upon such notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this expense. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.33. - Required services and facilities. 
(a)  The cable television system shall have a minimum channel capacity of 77 channels and at least 750 megahertz of bandwidth available for future use. 
(b)  Such system shall maintain a plant having the technical capacity for two-way communications. 
(c)  The grantee shall maintain the following: 
(1)  At least one specially designated, noncommercial public access channel available on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis; at least one specially designated channel for use by local educational authorities; at least one specially designated channel for local governmental uses; at least one specially designated channel for leased access uses; provided, however, that these uses may be combined on one or more channels until such time as additional channels become necessary in the opinion of the village. Financial and technical support and replacement and maintenance of equipment of this facility shall be separately incorporated into a franchise agreement. 
(2)  An institutional network (I-Net) of cable, optical, electrical or electronic equipment, used for the purpose of transmitting two-way telecommunications signals interconnecting designated entities as set forth in the franchise agreement and mutually agreed to by the grantee and the grantor. Such institutional network may be provided as needed by utilizing capacity on the system. 
(d)  The grantee shall incorporate into the system the capacity which will permit the village, in times of local emergency, to override by remote control the audio of all channels simultaneously which the grantee may lawfully override or to place a crawl on all such channels. The grantee shall provide emergency broadcast capacity pursuant to FCC rules. The grantee shall cooperate with the village in the use and operation of the emergency alert override system. 
(e)  Interconnection. 
(1)  The grantee may be required to interconnect its system with other adjacent cable television systems for the purpose of sharing public, educational and governmental access programming. Such interconnection shall be made within a reasonable time limit to be established by the village. 
(2)  Interconnection procedure. Upon receiving the directive of the village to interconnect, the grantee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
(3)  Relief. The grantee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the village may rescind its order to interconnect upon petition by the grantee to the village. The village shall grant the request if it finds that the grantee has negotiated in good faith and has failed to obtain an approval from the operator or franchising authority of the system to be interconnected or the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates. 
(4)  Cooperation required. The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority or city, county, state and federal regulatory agency which may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing or otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the village. 
(5)  Initial technical requirements to assure future interconnection capability. 
a.  All systems receiving franchises to operate within the village shall use the standard frequency allocations for television signals. 
b.  All systems are required to use signal processors at the head end for each television signal.

d.  A grantee shall provide such additional services and facilities as are contained in its application, if any. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.34. - Rules and regulations. 
(a)  In addition to the inherent powers of the village to regulate and control a cable television franchise and those powers expressly reserved by the village or agreed to and provided for herein, the right and power is hereby reserved by the village to promulgate such additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers and furtherance of the terms and conditions of this chapter; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(b)  The village may also adopt such regulations at the request of the grantee upon application. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.35. - Performance evaluation sessions. 
(a)  The village and the grantee may hold scheduled performance evaluation sessions within 30 days of the third, sixth and 12th anniversary dates of the grantee's award or renewal of the franchise and as may be required by federal and state law. All such evaluation sessions shall be open to the public. 
(b)  Special evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise at the request of the village or the grantee.

(a)  In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the village under this chapter or otherwise, the village reserves the right to forfeit and terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee thereunder in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and conditions. A substantial breach by the grantee shall include but shall not be limited to the following: 
(1)  Violation of any material provision of this chapter or the franchise or any material rule, order, regulation or determination of the village made pursuant to the franchise; 
(2)  Attempt to evade any material provision of this chapter or the franchise or practice any fraud or deceit upon the village or its subscribers;

(4)  Failure to provide the services promised in the grantee's application, if any, as incorporated herein by section 88.4. 
(5)  Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the village; or 
(6)  Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the franchise. 
(b)  The foregoing shall not constitute a substantial breach if the violation occurs but is without fault of the grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. The grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees. 
(c)  The village may make a written demand that the grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the village may place the issue of termination of the franchise before the village board. The village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue(s) which the village board is to consider. 
(d)  The village board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear any person interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether or not any violation by the grantee has occurred. 
(e)  If the village board shall determine the violation by the grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, the board may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be forfeited and terminated unless there is compliance within such period as the board may fix, which period shall not be less than 60 days, provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation. 
(f)  The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the village board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The board then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its discretion.

If the village has denied the grantee's petition for renewal of its franchise as provided by section 88.7, the village must exercise its option to purchase the system within 60 days of the denial of renewal and at least six months prior to the end of the franchise. Nothing shall prohibit the grantee, in the event of the election of the village to purchase the system, from requesting the court to set a reasonable bond of the village to secure the purchase price. The grantee shall execute such warranty deeds and other instruments as may be necessary. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007)

    The village shall have the right to cancel the franchise 120 days after the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless: 
(1)  Within 120 days after his/her election or appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and 
(2)  Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and the franchise granted to the grantee.

(b)  If the village determines that a material provision of this chapter is affected by any subsequent action of the state or federal government, the village and the grantee shall negotiate to modify any of the provisions herein to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this agreement.

(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.44. - Theft of services and tampering. 
    No person may intentionally do any of the following: 
(1)  Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a grantee by trick, artifice, deception, use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or other fraudulent means with the intent to deprive that grantee of any or all lawful compensation for rendering each type of service obtained. The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from the presence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device not authorized by the grantee, the major purpose of which is to permit reception of cable television services without payment. This inference is rebutted if the defendant demonstrates that he or she purchased that device for a legitimate use. 
(2)  Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain any cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the grantee providing that service. This subsection does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technical assistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler or receiving device was for a legitimate use. 
(3)  Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of distributing cable television service to any other dwelling unit without authority from a grantee. 
(4)  Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of obtaining cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the grantee providing the service. The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from proof that the cable service to the defendant's residence or business was connected under a service agreement with the grantee and has been disconnected by the grantee and that thereafter there exists in fact a connection to the system at the defendant's residence or business. 
(5)  Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device installed with the authorization of a grantee for the purpose of intercepting or receiving any program or other service carried by that grantee which that person is not authorized by that grantee to receive. The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be interred from proof that, as a matter of standard procedure, the grantee places written warning labels on its converters explaining that tampering with the device is a violation of law and the converter decoder is found to have been tampered with, altered or modified so as to allow the reception or interception of programming carried by the grantee without authority to do so. The trier of fact may also infer that a converter decoder has been altered or modified from proof that the grantee, as a matter of standard procedure, seals the converters with a label or mechanical device, that the seal was shown to the customer upon delivery of the decoder and that the seal has been removed or broken. The inferences under this subsection are rebutted if the grantee cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the customer. 
(6)  Possess without authority any device or printed circuit board designed to receive from a system any cable television programming or services offered for sale over that system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any of the acts under subsection (1) to (5) with the intent that the device or printed circuit be used to receive that grantee's services without payment. Intent to violate this subsection for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be inferred from proof of the existence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device if the totality of circumstances, including quantities or volumes, indicates possession for resale. 
(7)  Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish, advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit designed to receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a system from system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, with the intent that the device, printed circuit, plan or kit be used for the reception of that grantee's services without payment. The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from proof that the defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board, plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit board in violation of this subsection and during the course of the transaction for sale or lease the defendant expressly states or implies to the buyer that the product will enable the buyer to obtain cable television service without charge. 
(Ord. No. 2007-04, § I, 6-5-2007) 
Sec. 88.45. - Violations and penalties. 
    For the violation of any of the following provisions of this franchise, penalties shall be chargeable to the security as applicable as follows, and the village may determine the amount of the fine for other violations which are not specified in a sum not to exceed $500.00 for each violation, with each day constituting as separate violation. 
(1)  Failure to furnish, maintain or offer all cable services to any potential subscriber within the village upon order of the village: $200.00 per day, per violation, for each day that such failure occurs or continues.

(3)  Failure to provide access to data, documents, records or reports to the village as required by sections 88.19, 88.29, 88.30, 88.31 and 88.37: $200.00 per day, per violation, for each day such failure occurs or continues. 
(4)  Failure to comply with applicable construction, operation or maintenance standards: $300.00 per day, per violation.

(a)  Commercial and industrial classification codes set forth in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972 edition, as amended and supplemented, are adopted by the Village of Pewaukee as the basis for the issuance of discharge permits for building connections to a sewer. 
(b)  The application for a discharge permit shall be made on a form provided for that purpose by the village and shall be fully completed under oath by the property owner, user, or his duly authorized and knowledgeable officer, agent or representative, and acknowledged. If requested, the person making application shall also submit such scientific or testing data, or other information as may be required by the village. The village shall also have, at its discretion, the right to personally inspect the premises, equipment and material and laboratory testing facilities of the applicant. 
(c)  No fee shall be charged for a discharge application or permit. 
(d)  No discharge permit shall be issued by the village to any person whose discharge of material to sewers, whether shown upon the application or determined after inspection and testing conducted by the village, is not in conformance with federal and state statutes or local ordinances, rules and regulations, unless a waiver or variance of such standards and requirements is granted by the village in the manner set forth in this section. The village shall state in writing the reasons for denial or requirement for waiver-variance, and the written communication shall be mailed or personally delivered to the applicant within five days after denial. 
(e)  If the type or volume of material from property for which a discharge permit was previously granted shall materially and substantially change, the person granted such permit previously shall make a new application to the village in the same manner and form as originally made. A significant increase or decrease shall be defined as a 50 percent increase or decrease in the volume of industrial wastewater currently being discharged by a permittee whose daily average volume of industrial wastewater discharged into the village's sewerage system is 25,000 gallons per day or less. For permittees whose daily average volume of industrial wastewater discharge into the village's sewerage system is greater than 25,000 gallons per day, a significant increase or decrease shall be defined as a ten percent increase or decrease in the volume of industrial wastewater currently being discharged. 
(f)  If the application for a new permit or for one because of a change in the type or volume of material discharge is denied by the village, or if the discharge indicated from the permit application or inspection is not in accordance with the requirements of section 90.118(d), and a waiver or variance is required, the user may have the village review the denial or may request waiver-variance, provided the user shall give written notice of his request within 30 days after receiving the denial. The village board shall review the permit application, the written denial, and such other evidence and matters as the applicant shall present at its next regular meeting following receipt of the request for its review; and the decision of the village rendered publicly shall be final. 
(g)  If any discharge of material to a sewer shall materially and substantially differ in type and volume than shown in the application and permit, the person granted the permit and user shall immediately, upon order of the village, cease and desist from such discharge and shall also be subject to disconnection, fine and other penalties provided by this article. 
(h)  A grant of waiver or variance by the village may set forth such conditions, exceptions, time limitations, durations and expirations as the village deems necessary and proper. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(4)(l)(2)-(9), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.119. - Reporting criteria for nonresidential users. 
(a)  The Village of Pewaukee reserves the right to require any nonresidential user to submit quarterly, on forms provided by the village, a certified statement of the characteristics of its industrial wastes discharged into the sewers of the village. This statement shall be filed with the village not later than the tenth day of the month following the quarter for which the report is required. 
(b)  Any permittee subject to regulation by EPA categorical pretreatment standard must file a Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 101 annual monitoring report with the department of natural resources, even if total discharge volume is less than 10,000 gallons per day. 
(c)  The waste characteristics to be measured and certified by the user shall be: 
(1)  BOD in milligrams per liter. 
(2)  Suspended solids in milligrams per liter. 
(3)  Phosphorus in milligrams per liter. 
(4)  Such other constituents of wastewater as directed by the village. 
(d)  Should there be a difference in understanding between the village and user as to the characteristics in this section, the village reserves the right to use the village's results from analyses for purposes of billing. 
(e)  As part of the industrial pretreatment program required by the EPA and DNR, the village will conduct periodic industrial sampling to determine compliance with wastewater discharge regulations. These tests will be conducted by a state-certified contract laboratory and consist of 24-hour composite sampling, with some parameters requiring grab sampling. At least one inspection/sampling visit will take place annually; some industries will be sampled twice a year (once every six months). The costs of inspection and sampling will be billed back to the industry. 
(f)  Whenever required by the village, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying nonresidential wastewater and material shall install, and maintain at the owner's expense, a large manhole or sampling chamber in the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. There shall be ample room in each sampling chamber to accurately sample and take composite samples for analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently (of other premises and buildings of user) accessible to authorized representatives of the village at all times. Where construction of a sampling chamber is not economically or otherwise feasible, alternate arrangements for sampling may be arranged at the discretion of the village. 
(g)  Each sampling chamber shall contain a Parshall flume, weir or similar device with a recording and totalizing register for measuring liquid quantity; or the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as a measure of liquid quantity where it is substantiated by the village that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the village is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. 
(h)  Samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as determined by the village, and properly refrigerated and composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. Such sampling shall be done as prescribed by the village to assure representative quantities for the entire reporting period. Minimum requirements for determination of representative quantities or characteristics shall include reevaluation during each 12-month period. The determination of representative quantities and characteristics shall include not less than one calendar day of 24-hour composite samplings taken during periods of normal operation, together with acceptable flow measurements. 
(i)  The sampling frequency, sampling chamber, metering device, sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time, to inspection and verification by the village. 
(j)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall be determined in accordance with Standard Methods, specified in section 90.108 or with any other method approved by the village. 
(k)  Except for data determined to be confidential under Wis. Admin. Code § NR 211.26, relating to confidentiality, all reports required by this permit shall be available for public inspection at the village hall. 
(l)  The permittee shall retain and preserve for no less than three years any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of the permittee in connection with its discharge. All records that pertain to matters that are the subject of special orders or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the village shall be retained and preserved by the permittee until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(m)  The provisions of a permit are severable; and if any provision of the permit or the application of any provision of a permit to any circumstance is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances and the remainder of a permit shall not be affected. 
(n)  Knowingly making any false statement on any report or other document required by this permit or knowingly rendering any monitoring device or method inaccurate may result in prosecution under the criminal laws of Wisconsin as well as being subjected to civil penalties and relief.

Cross reference- Finance, § 2.125 et seq. 

Sec. 90.120. - Establishment of revenue system. 
    A user charge shall be assessed to all users by the Village of Pewaukee in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(a), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.121. - User charge system. 
(a)  Budget and appropriation. The Village of Pewaukee shall annually prepare an estimate of anticipated costs for each category of user charge for the forthcoming fiscal year. These estimates shall be made in the form of a rate ordinance and shall be proposed to the village board for enactment by January 1 of each year. 
(b)  Operation and maintenance charges. 
(1)  Operation and maintenance costs shall be separated in accordance with their applicability for flow, BOD, TSS, toxics, and nontoxic sampling/analysis. The percentage breakdown shall be reviewed each year by the village and approved by the village board. 
(2)  Operation and maintenance costs for flow, BOD and TSS shall be totaled for each. The unit charges for each shall be obtained by dividing the total costs by the previous year's total billable flow in 1,000 gallons, billable pounds of BOD, and billable pounds of TSS. But in no case shall a user pay less than that required for normal domestic strength sewage. To determine the toxics unit charge, the total costs attributable to all the toxics shall be divided by the total number of toxics assigned to be monitored by the village for all industries monitoring for toxics. The monitoring unit charge is obtained by dividing the total nontoxic sampling/analysis costs for all classes of industrial users by the number of industrial users in the user class times the number of samplings/analyses per year for that user class. 
(c)  Replacement charges. 
(1)  The replacement charge shall be sufficient to replace any equipment in the sewers or sewerage works owned by the village as required, in order to assure the continued peak performance of the equipment and to maintain the capacity for which the sewers and sewerage works were designed and constructed. The service life for real and personal property shall be established by the village in cooperation with the auditors, in accordance with experience of the village, federal guidelines and accepted accounting procedures. 
(2)  Yearly replacement costs for each piece of equipment shall be separated in accordance with their applicability to flow, BOD and TSS. This breakdown shall be reviewed annually by the village and approved by the village board. 
(3)  The yearly replacement costs attributable to flow, BOD and TSS shall be divided by the previous year's total billable flow in 1,000 gallons, billable pounds of BOD, and billable pounds of TSS, respectively, and totaled to obtain unit replacement charges. 
(d)  Toxics charges. For each user discharging toxics, the unit charges for toxics described in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be multiplied by the number of toxics assigned to be monitored by the village. 
(e)  Handling and sampling charges. A unit handling charge per bill to cover the costs of billing and collections shall be assessed each user. The total administrative and overhead costs associated with billing and collection shall be determined by the village. To determine the charge to be assessed each user, the village will divide the total administrative and overhead costs by the forthcoming year's estimated total number of bills to be issued. Industrial users shall be charged an additional amount to cover the costs of wastewater monitoring proportionate to the number of times per year their user class is sampled. This additional amount shall be determined as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
(f)  Additional charges. Additional charges shall be billed, as required, for the following: 
(1)  Actual costs incurred for user requested samplings and analyses. 
(2)  Actual costs incurred for water meter inspection requested by the user, or as required because of improper maintenance. 
(3)  Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for elsewhere in this article. 
(4)  Actual costs incurred for handling a user's check returned because of insufficient funds. 
(5)  Any customer of the village sewerage system who maintains an illegal clear water connection shall, after a 90-day notice to disconnect, pay a surcharge of 50 percent of his regular sewer service charge; and this surcharge shall be retroactive without prejudice to the right of the village to compel disconnection and to charge the cost against the property as a special tax. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(b), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.122. - Wastewater treatment charges. 
(a)  All users. The basic wastewater treatment bill to be paid by all users shall consist of user charges for operation, maintenance and replacement, using the unit charges from section 90.121(a, b) and user charges for billing and collection as described in section 90.121(e). The unit charges shall be applied to the user's billable flow, BOD and TSS, respectively. In no case, however, shall a user pay less than that required for normal domestic strength sewage. 
(b)  Industrial and commercial users. 
(1)  In addition to the basic wastewater treatment bill described in section 90.123(a) for the user charge system, wastewater treatment bills for industrial and commercial users shall consist of industrial waste monitoring charges as described in section 90.121(e), and charges for toxics for each user discharging toxics, as described in section 90.121(d). 
(2)  The village shall periodically sample and analyze wastes from selected users in each industrial and commercial user classification to determine the BOD and TSS strengths of the wastes, and these results shall be used as representative of wastes from all users in that classification for billing purposes unless the user's waste is classified by the village as having special problems. At the request of the user, samples shall be made and analyzed on the same frequency as samples for the user's classification, and that analysis shall be used as typical of that particular user's waste for billing purposes. Industries with wastes classified by the village as having special problems shall, if directed by the village, install, at the industry's own cost and in a structure located on the building service line, sampling devices required by the village to obtain exact information about the waste. 
(c)  Additional charges. Additional charges as described in section 90.121(f) shall, if required, be listed on the wastewater treatment bill. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(c), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.123. - Wastewater treatment bill. 
(a)  Bill period. A bill shall be produced and submitted to each user once every quarter on a billing cycle established by the village. The bill shall indicate the amount due, the due date and the late fee charge for a delinquent bill. 
(b)  Payment. The bill shall be due and payable in full on or before the due date indicated on the bill. 
(c)  Delinquent bills. 
(1)  Any bill not paid in full within 20 days after the date of billing shall be declared delinquent and a past-due notice issued to the billed party. The past-due notice shall indicate the billing period, the due date, the billing period amount due, the late fee assessed and the total amount due. 
(2)  Should a bill still be delinquent 120 days after the date of billing, the bill shall be referred to the clerk-treasurer for subsequent action. 
(3)  Nonreceipt of any bill described in this subsection shall not release the user of liability for any of those charges. In any case where the user is responsible for the nonreceipt of the bill, the conditions described for late payment and penalties shall apply. In those instances where the village is responsible for the nonreceipt of the bill, the village may, at its discretion, grant the user an extension of the due date and late payment conditions described in this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(d), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.124. - Debt service. 
    Debt service charge shall be collected by levying a debt service unit charge for each 1,000 gallons of metered water consumption or metered sewage flow. The debt service unit charges shall be obtained by dividing the total sewerage and sewage treatment annual debt service by the previous year's total billable flow (metered water consumption or metered sewage flow) in 1,000 gallons. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(e), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.125. - Connection charge. 
(a)  A connection fee shall be paid for each new sewer connection in the Village of Pewaukee. This fee shall be levied for each residential equivalent unit. A residential equivalent unit is defined as any single-family dwelling unit, be that unit a single-family residence, an apartment unit or a condominium unit. (For example, a four-unit apartment would have four residential equivalent units.) Residential equivalent units for nonresidential users shall be calculated by dividing the anticipated daily flow by 200 gallons per day. After one year of operation, the billable flows of all nonresidential users shall be reviewed. If it is found that the connection fee that was levied was insufficient, an additional fee shall be levied. In no case shall a nonresidential user be assessed less than one residential equivalent unit. 
(b)  The connection fee per residential equivalent unit shall be as set by the village board. 
(Ord. No. 427, § I(2)(f), 5-7-1996) 
Sec. 90.126. - Accounting. 
(a)  User charges. 
(1)  Moneys. All user charge moneys shall be placed in the Village of Pewaukee sewer department account. Such moneys shall be used only to cover the costs of operation and maintenance, replacement, toxics, handling and sampling, and other costs as outlined in section 90.121. 
(2)  Expenditures. Expenditures shall be made from the user charge moneys by the village in accordance with the detailed annual budget and ordinances enacted by the village. 
(3)  Replacement reserve expenditures. Expenditures from the accrued replacement reserve shall be made for renewals on facilities to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property that would result in an extended useful life or sustain the anticipated useful life. 
(4)  Renewals. Renewals to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property shall be capital expenditures that cause the annual estimate for accrued reserves from depreciation and replacement to be evaluated in terms of extended useful life as a result of preventive maintenance programs or of such renewals. The expenditures to overcome physical and/or functional obsolescence shall be capitalized against the element of the facility and charged to the fixed assets groups of accounts as an improvement to such element. Future estimates of accrued reserve requirements shall be evaluated and reflected in the replacement reserve requirements. 
(5)  Audit. An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant selected by the village. 
(b)  Debt service charges. All debt service charge moneys shall be placed in a debt service fund.

Chapter 91 - STORM WATER UTILITY[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, adopted Mar. 20, 2007, amended Ch. 91 to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 91, §§ 91.100-91.108, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2006-25, § 1, adopted Oct. 3, 2006. 

Sec. 91.100. - General operation. 
    The management of storm water and other surface water discharges within the Village of Pewaukee is a matter that impacts the public health, safety and welfare of the residents and occupants of the Village of Pewaukee. Failure to effectively manage storm water effects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the village by amongst other things increasing infiltration and inflow to the sanitary sewer system. In addition, surface water runoff creates erosions of land and damage to businesses and residences and creates sedimentation and other environmental damage within the village. In order to protect the public, health, safety and welfare the Village of Pewaukee is exercising its authority to establish a storm water utility pursuant to Wis. Stats. chs. 62 and 66, including, but not limited to, sections 62.04, 62.11, 62.16, 62.175, 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0809, 66.0811, and 66.0821. 
    The storm water utility may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage, and finance such facilities as deemed by the utility to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm and surface water management. These facilities may include, but not be limited to, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, water retaining wells and ponds, inverts, and such other facilities as will support a storm water management system. 
    The day-to-day oversight of the storm water utility shall be performed by the village administrator and the director of public works. Committee oversight of the utility operations shall fall under the public works and safety committee, which shall serve as an advisory committee to the village board on all matters relating to the storm water utility. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.101. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein: 
    Monthly utility revenue. The utility revenue is the estimated monthly expenditures for planning and inventories, capital expenditures, personnel and equipment and operation of the storm water utility, in accordance with established Village of Pewaukee policy. 
    Storm water utility fee. The storm water utility fee is defined as the annual charge developed for each parcel of land. 
    Utility factor. The utility factor is defined as the ratio of runoff volume, in inches, for a particular land use (zoning classification based upon the current actual land use of the property), to the runoff volume, in inches for an average single-family residential, assuming a two-inch rainfall and Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) "Type B" soil conditions. For properties containing multiple uses (i.e. commercial and residential), the underlying zoning district/land use classification will be used to determine the appropriate utility factor for the storm water fee calculation. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.102. - Storm water utility factors. 
    The storm water utility fee shall be determined by first determining the percentage of total runoff in the Village of Pewaukee which is attributed to single-family residential property. The per-acre fee for all other individual parcels shall be defined as the product of the single-family residential per-acre fee, the appropriate utility factor and the total acreage of the parcel. Single-family residential parcels shall be assessed on a per household basis. 
    The utility factors for various land uses are shown in the following table. This calculation is based upon a storm water utility feasibility study prepared by Short Elliott Hendrickson, Inc. for the Village of Pewaukee in January 2006. 
Classification Land Use/Zoning District Utility Factor 1 Single-family Residential (R-1 to R-5 zoning districts) 1.00 2 Multi-family Residential (R-6, RM and MH zoning districts) 1.92 3 Community Commercial (B-1 to B-3 zoning districts) 4.23 4 Industrial-Business Park (B-4 or B-5 zoning districts) 3.30 5 Institutional (IPS zoning district) 3.30 6 Environmental (Undeveloped lands within FW, FC, C-1, and C-2 zoning districts as set forth in the Village Zoning Code) EXEMPT 7 Park/Open Space (P-1 zoning district) EXEMPT 8 Public Road Right-of-Way EXEMPT 9 Open Water EXEMPT 10 Undeveloped platted subdivision outlots EXEMPT  
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.103. - Credits. 
    Information to justify a fee adjustment must be supplied by the property owner using a form application to be prepared by the village administrator. Such adjustments of fees shall not be retroactive. Credits will be reviewed regularly by a staff committee. 
    The storm water utility provides for credits for the use of Wisconsin DNR approved storm water best management practices (BMPs) such as storm water basins, green space, undeveloped land, etc. Credits must be applied for by December 15 of year preceding the year in which the credit is to be considered. The amount of the credit will be determined by the village engineer and approved by the village board. A property owner may appeal to the village board regarding a determination of the credit once per calendar year. 
(1)  Commercial, industrial, institutional. A credit may be granted to a commercial, industrial or institutional parcel that can demonstrate a minimum of 20 percent of the amount of storm water leaving the parcel via the use of an approved WI DNR storm water best management practice (BMP). Credits can be combined to account for a total reduction of up to 75 percent of the storm water utility fee. Documentation must be provided to the village for evaluation of the claim. It is strongly suggested that the documentation be prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Wisconsin and provide the necessary drawings and calculations to support the claim. It is the applicant's responsibility to prove the claim. 
(2)  Examples of best management practices. 
a.  Storm water detention basins (retention and infiltration systems), grassed swales and drainage from impervious areas into grassed surfaces may be eligible for a credit only if the water from the basins or swales is discharged to the village's municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) at the pre-development rate, as outlined in the village's storm water ordinance. 
b.  Credits may be given to a parcel that is infiltrating storm water from roof structures into approved rain garden designs. Consideration will be given to structures that are discharging to grass areas (direct discharge from roof or from a gutter system) if the grass area is of a sufficient size to handle the volume, is not steeply graded and has appropriate soils (Type A, B or C) for infiltration. Gutter systems discharging to impervious surfaces such as clay soils, parking lots, or plastic lined landscaping are NOT eligible for this credit. 
 50 percent to 75 percent of roof surface discharging to infiltration area: 20 percent credit 
 76 percent to 90 percent of roof surface discharging to infiltration area: 25 percent credit 
 91 percent to 100 percent of roof surface discharging to infiltration area: 50 percent credit 
c.  Credits may be given to a parcel where the parking lot is graded to sheet storm water off into a pervious surface such as grass, rain garden or wooded area if the area is of a sufficient size to handle the volume, is not steeply graded and has appropriate soils (Type A, B or C) for infiltration. Curb cut parking lot designs may also be considered, but must be documented by a PE for their design effectiveness. 
 25 percent to 50 percent discharge to a pervious surface: 25 percent credit 
 51 percent to 100 percent discharge to a pervious surface: 50 percent credit 
d.  "Engineered" rain garden. Parking lots engineered to meet the storm water ordinance requirements of a two-inch rain are strongly encouraged and can be granted a credit of up to the maximum credit (75 percent) if the design treats 75 percent or more of the total storm water volume generated on the parcel (storm water from buildings must also be considered). 
(3)  Land use credits. 
a.  Vacant land credit. Vacant land meeting the following criteria is to be excluded from the area used to calculate the monthly charge. 
1.  The property must not be developed in any way, or have been developed in the past ten years. The property must reflect land in an "undisturbed, natural state" with non-impacted soils (i.e., the soils are not compacted). 
2.  The vacant land must represent at least 50 percent of the total parcel or be one acre or more in size. 
3.  Vacant land does not include "green space" as outlined below. 
b.  Green space credit. Green space areas meeting the following criteria can receive up to a 75 percent reduction from the area used to calculate the monthly charge. 
1.  Green spaces shall be contiguous pervious vegetated areas incorporated into the developed parcel. 
2.  The space shall not have more than 25 percent impacted, compacted soils. Examples of impacted spaces are trails, ball fields, gravesites, and picnic areas. 
3.  Green space must be 20 feet or more away from the nearest impervious surface or structure. 
4.  The green space must be a minimum of one acre in size and not less than 25 percent of the total parcel. 
5.  Grassed parking areas that are utilized more than 15 days per year are excluded from the green space credit, as these are impacted, compacted soils. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.104. - Exemptions. 
    The following land uses are exempt from the storm water management fee: 
(1)  Environmental (Undeveloped lands within floodway, floodplain, and conservancy zoning classifications as set forth in the Village Zoning Code). 
(2)  Park/open space (P-1 park zoning). 
(3)  Public road right-of-way. 
(4)  Undeveloped platted subdivision outlots. 
(5)  Open water. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.105. - Payment of fee. 
    Storm water utility fees shall be billed to the storm water utility customer, at the same time and in the same manner as the water and sanitary sewer bills. The property owner shall be ultimately responsible for the payment of the storm water utility charge. A storm water utility charge shall be sent in a like manner to any property not taking service from the sanitary sewer or water utility. The fee shall be due and payable under the same terms as water and sanitary sewer utility bills. The failure to pay the storm water utility charges when due shall subject the property owner to such penalties as are established under state law and/or by the village board and may result in the charges being assessed as a lien against the property pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0821 and 66.0809. Any prepayment or overpayment of charges shall be retained by the Village of Pewaukee and applied against subsequent fees. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.106. - Appeal of fee. 
(a)  Procedure for filing appeals: 
(1)  A written appeal shall be filed with the village administrator prior to the utility charge due date; or 
(2)  Within 30 days of payment, a written challenge to the storm water charge must be filed with the village administrator on behalf of the customer, specifying all bases for the challenge and the amount of the storm water charge the customer asserts is appropriate. Failure to file a challenge within 30 days of payment waives all right to later challenge the charge. 
(b)  The public works and safety committee shall review the appeals of storm water utility charges. 
(1)  The village administrator will coordinate the processing of all appeals and challenges, and schedule the meetings of the review committee to assure that all appeals and challenges are processed within the times established by this chapter. 
(2)  The public works and safety committee shall meet no more often than once per month to review appeals and challenges, and make a determination of whether the storm water charge is fair and reasonable, or whether a refund is due the customer. 
(c)  The customer has 30 days from the decision of the review committee to file a written appeal to the village board. 
(d)  If the village board or public works and safety committee determines that a refund is due the customer, the refund will be applied as a credit on the customer's next quarterly storm water billing, if the refund will not exceed the customer's next quarterly storm water billing, or will be refunded at the discretion of the village clerk/treasurer. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.107. - Penalty for late payment. 
    The penalty for late payment shall be addressed as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0809. 
(Ord. No. 2007-01, § 1, 3-20-2007) 
Sec. 91.108. - Effective date for storm water utility. 
    The utility shall be created and in effect on January 1, 2007.

CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
Entire Chapter Repealed and Recreated - #12-12
SECTION 17.0100 INTRODUCTION
17.0101 STATUTORY AUTHORITY
These regulations are adopted under the authority granted by Sections 59.692,
62.23(7), 62.231, 62.234, and 87.30, of Wisconsin statutes as amended.
17.0102 TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known as, referred to, and cited as the "Zoning Ordinance"
of the City of Pewaukee, Wisconsin.
17.0103 PURPOSE
It should be the purpose of every municipality and is the purpose of the governing
body of the City of Pewaukee to develop and maintain a community that is, at
once, physically and fiscally sound, physically attractive, diversified in types of land
development based on an adopted long-range plan in order that the inhabitants of
the City can enjoy the possibility to live, work, and play within the City, and be
provided a reasonable level of local government services at a relatively low cost of
such services. The specific purpose of this Zoning Ordinance is to help implement
the adopted City plans and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
the populace as well as the aesthetics of the City of Pewaukee. The City Plan
Commission and the City Common Council shall continuously prepare a
Comprehensive Plan (or Master Plan) to guide the orderly development of the city
including planning objectives and policies to guide land use and development
decisions. All comprehensive plan elements, in whatever degree of detail they
may be presented, shall provide the basis for approval of all use and development
of land under this Ordinance and the related Chapter 18, Land Division Ordinance
and Section 10.06, Official Map, of Chapter 10 of the City Codes and Ordinances.
17.0104 INTENT
It is the general intent that this chapter of the Codes and Ordinances of the City of
Pewaukee (Zoning Ordinance) be used in the regulation and mapping of zoning
district classifications as set forth herein and in such mapping reflect the existing,
most restrictive, or imminent use(s) within the mapped area at the time of initial
mapping or amendments thereto. Imminent means commencing physical
development of or construction on an individual property within a reasonable
construction period--usually 12 to 18 months, following rezoning of the property for
the proposed new use. It is not the intent that the zoning district maps, which are
an integral part of this chapter, substitute in whole or in part for the long-range land
use plan or other components of the comprehensive plan for the City. An officially
adopted change in the zoning classification which provides for uses that are not
reflected on the Citys long-range land use plans will, however, automatically
constitute a change to the long-range land use plan. The citys comprehensive
plan includes, at least: neighborhood plans; general long-range land use plans;
general and specific utility and transportation plans; park plans; and, flood,
conservancy, and drainage or storm water management plans. Further, this
chapter and its application should not be a substitute for other City plan
implementation and regulatory devices such as detail development plans, the Land
Division Ordinance, Storm Water Management Plan, Official Map, Building Code,
Housing Code, and specific developers agreements and applicable federal, state
and county regulations.
More specifically, it is the intent of this Ordinance to regulate and restrict the use of
all structures, lands, and waters within the Citys jurisdiction; and to:
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 2 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
a. Regulate Lot Coverage and the size and location of all structures so as to
prevent overcrowding and to provide adequate sunlight, air, sanitation, traffic
circulation, and drainage;
b. Regulate Population Density and Distribution so as to avoid sprawl or high
concentrations that relate to congestion of streets and highways and over use
of utility systems and to facilitate the provision of adequate public services,
facilities, and utilities;
c. Regulate Parking, Loading, and Access so as to lessen congestion in and
promote the safety and efficiency of streets and highways;
d. Secure Safety from fire, flooding, pollution, contamination and other dangers;
e. Stabilize and Protect existing and potential property values;
f. Preserve, Protect and enhance the beauty of the City of Pewaukee;
g. Control and, Where Possible, Prevent erosion, sedimentation, and other
pollution of the surface and subsurface waters;
h. Further the Maintenance of safe and healthful surface and groundwater water
conditions;
i. Prevent Flood Damage to persons and property and minimize expenditures for
flood relief and flood control projects;
j. Provide for and Protect a variety of suitable commercial and industrial sites;
k. Protect the traffic-carrying capacity of existing and proposed arterial streets
and highways;
l Prevent the mixing of incompatible uses.
m. Implement those City, county, watershed, and regional comprehensive plans
or components of such plans adopted by the City of Pewaukee; and,
n. Provide for the administration and enforcement of this Ordinance; and provide
penalties for the violation thereof.
17.0105 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere
with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements,
ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to
laws; however, wherever this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
17.0106 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held
to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City
and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by
Wisconsin statutes.
17.0107 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Ordinance shall not be affected thereby. If any application to a particular structure,
parcel of land, or body of water is adjudged to be unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction such judgment shall not be applicable to any other
structure, land, or water not specifically included in said judgment.
17.0108 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection provided by this Ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience and
scientific methods of study. On rare occasions, larger floods may occur or the
flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes such as ice dams
or bridge openings restricted by debris. Therefore, this Ordinance does not imply
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 3 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
that areas outside of the delineated 100 year recurrence interval (base flood)
floodplain or land uses permitted within the floodplain will be totally free from
flooding and associated flood damages, nor shall this Ordinance create a liability
on the part of or a cause of action against the City of Pewaukee or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
Ordinance (see sub-section 17.0435 of this ordinance).
17.0109 REPEAL
All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting
with this Ordinance, to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
17.0110 EFFECTIVE DATE
This Ordinance and amendments thereto shall be effective after a public hearing,
review and recommendation by the City Plan Commission and adoption by the
Common Council, as provided by law (see Sections 17.1100 and 17.1300).

detailed site and architectural plans and, in the case of commercial, industrial or
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 7 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
institutional uses, or a Wisconsin statute authorized community based residential
facility (CBRF), a Business Plan of Operations as set forth in this section and in
sub-section 17.0210 and on forms provided by the City. Site and building plans
and business plans of operation shall be submitted to the City Planner prior to the
Plan Commission meeting in a time frame determined by the City Planner. The
Plan Commission members shall familiarize themselves with the site, existing and
proposed structures, architecture, neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway
locations, loading and unloading in the case of commercial and industrial uses,
highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, landscaping,
sewerage and water systems, as well as plans of proposed operation. The Plan
Commission may delegate the responsibility for review and approval of Business
Plans of Operation jointly to the City Planner and Zoning Administrator. The
applicant for permits for site and building activity will be responsible for final
grading and landscaping of all single and two-family building sites and for assuring
that there is adherence to all applicable plans, ordinances and statutes. Design
and construction of individual one and two family dwellings will be reviewed and
approved by the Building Inspector and/or City Planner.
a. Compliance
(1) Compliance with all other provisions of this Ordinance, such as lot width
and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic, and highway access shall
be required of all uses. Variances may only be granted as provided in
Section 17.1000 of this ordinance. Conditions such as landscaping,
architectural design, type of construction, flood-proofing, anchoring of
structures, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties,
lighting, fencing, landscape screening, operational control, hours of
operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access
restrictions, increased yards, or parking requirements, may be required by
the Plan Commission upon its finding that such regulation or restrictions
are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
(2) The Plan Commission, in its determinations, may require that applicants for
approval provide a cash bond or letter of credit to ensure timely
performance in completing their project or specific portions thereof. (Also
see sub-section 17.0204).
b. Review and Findings.
The Plan Commission shall review the referred plans and Business Plan of
Operations at a regularly scheduled Plan Commission meeting. The Plan
Commission shall not approve any plans unless they find after viewing the
application that uses and structure(s), as planned, will meet all regulations and
standards set forth by the City and will not violate the intent and/or use and
purpose of this Ordinance. The Plan Commission will approve said plans only
after determining that the proposed building or buildings will not impair an
adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, or substantially increase
the danger of fire, or traffic congestion, or otherwise endanger the public
health or safety. Any approval by the Plan Commission and its staff will
become null and void if the structure, site development, or planned use
is not commenced within 24 months from the date of approval and no
requested extension has been granted by the Plan Commission. The
Plan Commission may designate the City Planner and Zoning Administrator or
a committee of the Plan Commission to review and jointly approve written
Business Plans of Operation when site or building plans are not proposed or
have already been approved by the Plan Commission. (Please see Appendix
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 8 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
for standard Business Plan of Operation Forms). (Also, the City web site
is www.cityofpewaukee.us)
c. Appeals
Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Plan Commission
related to site, building and/or Plan of Operation review may appeal the
decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals, City Common Council or Circuit
Court. Such appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk/Treasurer or the Clerk of
Courts no more than thirty (30) days following the final decision of the Plan
Commission or its staff. (See Section 17.1000 and sub-section 17.1402 in
this ordinance)
17.0208 SITE RESTRICTIONS
No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for such
use or structure by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage,
adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography, low percolation rate or
bearing strength, erosion susceptibility, or any other feature likely to be harmful to
the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the City and its
inhabitants. The City Engineer, or any other official acting on behalf of the City, in
applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts
upon which he bases his conclusion that the land is not suitable for a certain use
and/or structure. The applicant shall have an opportunity to present evidence to the
Plan Commission contesting such determination of unsuitability. Thereafter the
Plan Commission may affirm, modify or withdraw the determination of unsuitability.
In any event, the following requirements must be met:
a. All lots or parcels shall abut upon a public street, road, or highway for a
minimum frontage width of 33 feet or as otherwise required in the City Land
Division Ordinance (Chapter 18), if more restrictive. In hardship
circumstances related to parcels of land existing prior to August 1982, the Plan
Commission may, at their discretion, allow one (1) or two (2) residential
principal uses on separate parcels to have access to a public street via a
common easement as long as such easement is at least 33 feet in width and is
wholly contained within one parcel.
b. All Principal Structures shall be located on a lot or building space; and only one
(1) principal structure shall be located, erected, or moved onto a lot or building
space in a single-family residential district, with the exception of a
condominium arrangement in which two or more single-family houses are
located on a parcel of land held in common by all the owners of the individual
single-family houses as a conditional use and the net density (dwelling unit to
land ratio) of the condominium development is no greater than allowed under
the zoning classification of the parcel. Construction of accessory
structures on a lot with no principal use will not be permitted. The Plan
Commission may permit more than one principal structure per lot in districts
where more than one structure is either needed or suitable for the orderly
development of the parcel. Where additional structures are permitted, the Plan
Commission may impose additional yard requirements, open space or
landscaping requirements, or parking requirements, or require a larger
minimum separation distance between principal structures.
c. No Building or Zoning Permit shall be issued for a lot or parcel which abuts a
public street dedicated to only a portion of its proposed right-of-way width and is
located on that side of the proposed street from which the required dedicated
right-of-way has not been secured.
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 9 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
d. Lots Abutting More Restrictive zoning districts shall provide side and rear yard
setbacks not less than those required in the more restrictive abutting district. If
the boundary of the more restrictive district is encompassed within railroad or
street right-of-way, the more restrictive yard requirements may be waived by the
City Planner.
e. No River or Stream shall be Altered or Relocated until such alteration has been
applied for and granted in accordance with the requirements of Section 17.1100
of this ordinance, federal agencies, Wisconsin statutes and codes and
regulations or other codes and ordinances of the City. (Also see sub-sections
17.0435 and 17.0436 of this ordinance)
f. Structures or plantings proposed to be located within the defined "Horizontal
Area of Solar Detriment" of an existing use having an operational active solar
system may not be placed so as to intrude into the defined "Vertical Area of
Solar Detriment" of the existing use. (Please see sub-section 17.0909).
g. Soil Limitations: Certain soil types within the City as shown on the operational
soil survey maps prepared by the U.S.D.A., Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in
cooperation with the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission,
have severe or very severe limitations for onsite soil absorption sanitary sewage
disposal facilities due to one or more of the following reasons: high or
fluctuating water table, flooding, groundwater contamination, silting, slow
permeability, steep slopes, or proximity to bedrock. Such soil data will be
considered by the Plan Commission when development requiring onsite soil
absorption sanitary sewage disposal facilities are proposed on those soil types
which have the above characteristics.
h. No Topsoil or Subsoil shall be removed from any land development site or from
individual agricultural, commercial, industrial, institutional, or recreation sites or
from land within the designated 100 year base flood floodplain without the
proper review and approval of an application for such removal by the Plan
Commission. If topsoil removal is permitted by the Plan Commission, enough
topsoil must be retained on the site to provide a minimum of six (6) inches of
topsoil to be spread over all future grassed or landscaped areas on the site.
Screening, sifting or other processing of topsoil will not be allowed without
permission of the Plan Commission. Likewise, no land, water or wetland area
of the City shall be filled, ditched, drained or inundated without the approval of
the Plan Commission and/or Common Council pursuant to this or other City
Ordinances. No lands within the designated 100 year base flood floodplain may
be filled, ditched, drained or inundated with the exception of the construction of
required public utility and transportation facilities which would require adherence
to regulations as set forth in this sub-section and by FEMA and NR116. (Also
see sub-sections 17.0435 and 17.0436).
i. No trees or shrubs shall be removed from any land development site
encompassing two or more dwelling unit parcels or encompassing more than
four acres unless and until a plan is prepared by the owner or developer and
approved by the Plan Commission or City Planner showing the location, type
and size of all such wood growth and indicating which such growth will be
removed and where and how it will be replaced or substituted for on the final
development plan. Such plan must be submitted to the City Planner for review
and recommendation to the Plan Commission. Any site or building plan
approval is contingent upon such a wood growth plan being submitted and
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 10 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
approved. If wood growth is removed without such approved plan, the owner or
developer will be required to replace such wood growth on the basis of three
specimens for each one removed.
j. Any area of a development or construction site on which bare earth has been
exposed to the elements and which will not be included within the building or
structure envelope shall be seeded or sodded at the direction of the City
Planner, City Engineer or Zoning Administrator so as to reduce erosion of soil
on and off the site. All permanent stormwater facilities or improvements will be
accomplished in accordance with the City stormwater management plan and
plan implementation measures. (See Chapter 19 of the Municipal Code).
17.0209 USE RESTRICTIONS
The following use restrictions and regulations shall apply:
a. Principal Uses. Only those principal uses as specified in zoning district
regulations set forth herein, their essential services, and the following uses shall
be permitted in that zoning district. Principal residential units located within a
residential zoning district may not be used for retail or service commercial,
institutional or industrial purposes except for an approved home occupation as
defined in Section 17.1400 or a Community Based Residential Facility (CBRF),
and such residential units may not be rented or leased by the owner or
occupant to a second party for a period of time less than 28 consecutive days.
(Also see definition of residential unit in Section 17.1400).
b. Accessory Uses and structures are permitted in any district but not until their
principal use and/or structure is present or under construction and a building or
zoning permit is obtained. Residential accessory uses shall not involve the
conduct of any business, trade, or industry except approved home occupations
and home offices as defined in this ordinance, and accessory buildings shall
not be used for residential purposes, except as noted below. Accessory uses
also include incidental repairs to the principal structure; storage structures;
parking structures and areas; home use gardening; private swimming pools;
and private emergency shelters. Mobile homes and recreation vehicles
designed or configured to be driven or towed are not principal or accessory
structures and may not be used for habitation or storage except in approved
mobile home parks and RV campgrounds or in the case of officially recognized
emergencies. One such vehicle owned by the owner of the premises and less
than 30 feet in length, including draw bar or tongue, may be temporarily
stored outside within the buildable area of a residential property for no more
than 45 days in a calendar year if property deed restrictions/covenants allow,
but may not be used as a living unit or extra bedroom. Storage units such as
dumpsters and portable-on-demand (pod) storage units are not accessory
structures. Watchmen quarters in industrial or commercial districts and
quarters of itinerant agricultural laborers in an agricultural district may be
accessory structures upon granting of a conditional use permit for such
specific use by the Plan Commission. Small accessory structures or garden
buildings intended for the storage of yard maintenance equipment having not
more than 120 square feet in floor space may be located within rear or side
yard areas but not closer than ten (10) feet to a property line or other building
and not within designated easements. All accessory structures larger than 120
square feet shall be constructed using the same type and color of exterior
materials, including roofing, as the principal structure on the property.
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 11 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
c. Conditional Uses and their accessory uses are considered as special uses
requiring review, public hearing, and approval by the Plan Commission and
Common Council in accordance with section 17.0500 of this ordinance, and
when approved, requiring special zoning district map delineation in
accordance with section 17.0400. In addition to those uses specified
elsewhere herein, the following uses may be deemed to be conditional uses
by the Plan Commission: Any principal use in addition to the first such use on
a single building parcel or space; any parcel proposed to be divided so as to
create a flag lot; any proposed use or development within 500 feet of the
existing or proposed rights-off-way of freeways, expressways, and other
controlled access highway; within 1,500 feet of an existing or proposed
freeway or expressway interchange or turning lane right-of-way; or, any
proposed use within 500 feet of the existing or proposed intersections of two or
more arterial streets or highways which requires a rezoning of the parcel or a
reconfiguration of the points of ingress/egress. Such uses, when designated a
conditional use, shall be specifically reviewed and approved by the Plan
Commission and Common Council as provided in section 17.0500 of this
ordinance and once issued may not be rescinded except by Plan Commission
and Common Council action unless the use is discontinued for a period of
twelve (12) months.
d. Unclassified or Unspecified Uses may be permitted by the Plan Commission
provided that such uses are similar in character to the principal uses permitted
in the zoning district and create no circumstances that would detrimentally
affect adjacent properties.
e. Legal Non-conforming Uses existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance
revision may be continued until the specific use is discontinued, at which time
any subsequent use of the premises involved must be in conformance with this
ordinance.
f. Temporary Uses or Structures, such as shelters for materials and equipment or
construction office trailers being used in the construction of a permanent
structure, may be permitted for a period not to exceed 12 months while
construction is in progress and such uses or structures must be screened from
public view when physically possible to do so. Movable or portable-ondemand
storage (pods) units and dumpsters may not be used as permanent
outdoor storage facilities unless enclosed from view within a City Plan
Commission approved permanent enclosure and may only be used as
temporary storage in the event of an emergency or as a material and
equipment shelter during moving of personal home or business items or
construction of a building. All temporary structures/units shall be removed
when directed by the Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator. Commercial
or business trucks, truck trailers, vans, trailers, recreation vehicles or mobile
homes are not accessory uses and may not be used as permanent or
temporary storage units or as signs or sign supporting structures and shall not
be parked in the open in residential districts. (Also see b, above and subsection
17.0601 and Chapter 5.00).
g. Conceptual Approval of Planned Unit Development (PUD), group housing,
CBRFs, multiple family development, commercial, industrial, institutional, or
mixed-use projects may be granted by the Plan Commission. Such conceptual
approval shall serve as a notice of intent to formally approve a project when
detailed plans and/or zoning petitions meeting the requirements of this
Ordinance and conditions set by the Plan Commission are submitted in a
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 12 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
formal proposal or application. Conceptual approval shall not, however, be
binding on the Plan Commission or the Common Council. In such cases,
the Plan Commission may require a public hearing conforming to the review
procedures set forth in sections 17.0500 and 17.1300 of this ordinance.
17.0210 PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS FOR THE AESTHETIC EVALUATION OF SITE
AND BUILDING PROJECTS
a. Introduction and Intent. The process of private building and development in a
community may be simple or complex depending upon the size of the project, the
number of participants, the ease of communication among the various private and
public parties involved, and the content and clarity of the public rules and
regulations. While the community representatives cannot usually directly affect
either the project size or the number of project participants; they can have a direct
affect on the content and clarity of rules and regulations as well as the
communication, and indeed, interpretation of any such rules and regulations.
Like inhabitants of most developing communities, Pewaukee City officials and
citizens have legitimate concerns about both the future character of the community
and the integrity of existing and historic development. One such concern is in
regard to land uses or the mix of land uses, both existing and planned. Another
concern is the financial capability of development (developers) to provide the
required and promised improvements and, the financial capability of the community
to provide the necessary and requested services. A third major concern,
importantly, is in regard to the visual impact or image of the community by people
living within or only traveling through the City. The intent or purpose of this subsection
is to provide principles and standards for use by property owners, potential
developers and City officials in the preparation and review of site and building
plans proposed within the City with emphasis on and the primary objective of
heightening the visual character and quality and, therefore, the value of the sites
and buildings proposed and, thereby, the entire community. It is understood that
such visual enhancement is also expected to be maintained over time and not be
only an initial accomplishment to be forgotten.
The proponents of any single or multiple use development (other than an individual
single-family or two-family building) proposed to be undertaken within the City of
Pewaukee, must, pursuant to sub-section 17.0207, present a site and building plan
to the Plan Commission for review and approval. Such approval along with any
conditions must be granted prior to receipt by the owner/builder/developer of a
permit to commence building or site development activity. The intent of this subsection
of the zoning ordinance is twofold: to provide a systematic, equal basis for
review and discussion of projects; and, to provide general guidelines to be used in
the review of a development or building project. In order to identify specific
standards for the visible elements of site and building design which embody the
general desires of the community, a set of agreed upon principles have been
established which form the foundation for the standards which will follow.
b. Site Planning and Design Principles. It must be noted that a principle is a truth
or tenet -- a statement of fact as relates to a particular topic, in this case site
planning and design. Following is a list of principles, which should be utilized
by everyone concerned in any Site Planning and Design Project in the City of
Pewaukee:
(1) The development or building site must be viewed as only one element of
the total developed and undeveloped environment in the vicinity of the
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 13 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
site. Therefore, attention must be given to how the site and the
development on the site will ultimately fit into the total environment.
(2) Site planning and design is the process by which site features and uses
on the site are made to be compatible, functional and visually pleasing.
(3) All elements and aspects of the site, both natural and man-made, are
important to the aesthetic character of the site.
(4) Adjacent or contiguous uses or facilities may have a major affect on the
site or site uses.
(5) Major changes in elevations and land forms on the site, which, thereby
change the character and/or physical capabilities of the site are not,
generally, conducive to good site development unless such changes are
well planned and are necessary, as an example; a quarry, to final
development/redevelopment of the quarry site.
(6) The specific location of site access is critical to both the future use of the
site and the safety and convenience of persons traveling on adjacent
public ways.
(7) Site grading, landscaping, paving, fencing, lighting, signage, storm water
drainage and other site enhancement are an integral part of any building
and development project.
c. Building, Design, Layout and Construction Principles Following is a list of
principles which should be utilized by everyone concerned in any Building,
Design, Layout and Construction project in the City:
(1) No side or facade of a building or structure is exempt from public view and,
consequently, all sides or facades should be visually pleasing and
architecturally and aesthetically compatible.
(2) The shape, size, dimension, architectural style, facade material, texture and
color, building landscaping, building signage, and, the setting of the building
within its immediate environment are all elements of the building structure
design addressed by the designer, both individually and in concert.
(3) Each color, texture or material of which the exterior of a building is
composed may, individually, present a visual statement to the viewer and,
therefore, in order not to present a conflicting or complex visual statement,
the arrangement and mix of colors, textures and materials should be
carefully considered and the number of such elements minimized.
(4) Some building materials present a visual statement of strength and
permanence to the immediate environment and to the community and
should be encouraged, while other materials which make a building or
structure appear temporary should be avoided.
(5) Individual buildings may be attractive but when duplicated on the same or
adjacent parcels or on the same horizontal plane may detract from the
visual character of the overall development.
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 14 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
(6) Some use elements of a building structure, such as outside mechanical
equipment, loading docks and areas, trash storage areas, and raw material,
vehicle or equipment storage areas are not, usually, attractive and often
detract from the visual appearance of the building unless careful attention is
given to placement, construction, structural and/or landscape screening of
such areas.
(7) Building landscaping, that is landscaping which is or appears to be an
integral part of the building facade design, needs to be carefully planned
and the appropriate grading and plant materials used so as not to detract
from the architecture of the building.
(8) Building signage, that is signage which is or appears to be an integral part
of the building facade design, needs to be carefully planned and the
appropriate sign materials, size, message wording, sign lighting and color
used so as not to detract from the architecture of the building or be
disruptive.
d. Site Planning and Design Standards
A standard (or criteria) is either a quantitative or qualitative model or value level
by or against which all related actions or activities are measured. In this regard
a standard is sometimes referred to as a "yardstick". Moreover, quantitative
standards are those which, when applied, will reveal a quantitative difference, or
similarity between the standard and the action or activity being measured by the
standard. For example; the action related to a site planning standard that
states that, "No man-made slope or disturbed natural slope shall be greater
than 3:1, when 3 is the horizontal measurement", can be measured
quantitatively to determine if, indeed, the standard has been met.
A qualitative standard, on the other hand, is a standard which, when applied,
involves a judgment, usually subjective, that the action or activity has met or
can meet the stated standard. For example; a site planning standard that states
that "All parking areas shall be screened in a visually pleasing manner to soften
the visual presentation of parked cars and paved area", requires that the
person(s) making the determination as to whether or not the standard is met
actually looks at the screening structure, device or plant materials and makes a
qualitative judgment. If it can be concluded that the materials, device or
structure as designed or constructed are individually or collectively visually
pleasing, there should be no problem making such a judgment. If, however, the
materials are different in character the judgment is usually more difficult. Even
the arrangement of several individually pleasing materials may not, in concert,
be pleasing. Whenever possible we try to avoid purely qualitative standards.
Following are both quantitative and qualitative standards related to site
development, which will be used by the Plan Commission in the review of every
site or development plan:
(1) STANDARD NO. SD-1
(a) The natural landscape of a development site, including topography,
ponds, drainage ways, vegetation, and soils shall be disturbed to the least
extent possible to accomplish ultimate site development and to ensure
such protection the Plan Commission may require a specific survey and
presentation of vegetation encompassed within the site.
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 15 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
(b) Final man-made site grades on a continuous slope of more than 100 feet
in horizontal distance shall not exceed 3:1 on any part of the site where 3
is the horizontal dimension, and shall not exceed a 4:1 grade on more
than 20 percent of the site.
(2) STANDARD NO. SD-2
(a) The drainage pattern on the site shall not be changed significantly and no
change to the drainage pattern on lands in the immediate vicinity of the
site shall be allowed.
(b) Storm drainage outfall from the completely developed site and generated
from a 100 year recurrence interval (base flood) rain storm event shall not
exceed the physical ability of the streams, drainage ways or storm sewer
immediately adjacent and downstream from the site to accommodate
such periodic storm drainage and shall be in compliance with all WisDNR
and FEMA rules and regulations.
(3) STANDARD NO. SD-3
(a) All streets interior to the development site, whether private or public, and
all public utilities shall be constructed to City construction standards in
terms of cross-section, grades and construction materials.
(b) No segment of any public or private street within the overall development
site shall exceed 10 percent vertical grade and no segment of any such
street shall exceed 8 percent vertical grade for a continuing horizontal
distance of more than 200 feet. (See Chapter 18 of City ordinances)
(c) Approved points of access between streets within the development site
and intersecting arterial or collector streets shall be designed to
accommodate a minimum four (4) lane divided entry for a minimum
distance of 250 feet into the development site when the average daily
traffic (ADT) on such entry is expected to exceed 500.
(4) STANDARD NO. SD-4
(a) No more than 60 percent of any lot, parcel or total development site shall
be covered with buildings, paving, gravel or other covering materials
which are impervious to surface water absorption. (Also see sub-section
17.0434)
(b) No less than 40 percent of the development site shall be retained in either
an undisturbed natural state or in attractive, planned and arranged ground
cover and landscape plantings, earthen berms and natural or man-made
water impoundments.
(c) Except in single and two-family residential areas, no impervious surface,
including graveled area, shall be placed closer than ten (10) feet from a
property boundary.
(d) An existing designated wetland or designated 100 year recurrence
interval (base flood) floodplain may comprise no more than 20 percent of
the total green space requirement on any parcel as set forth in (4)(b),
above, or no more than two square feet of each required ten square feet.
(5) STANDARD NO. SD-5
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 16 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
(a) Fencing designed to visually screen areas of the site from passersby shall
be of a type and quality and constructed of materials that will be aesthetic
and compatible with the building structure(s).
(b) Site fencing shall be designed and constructed to be readily maintained in
a safe and aesthetic manner.
(6) STANDARD NO. SD-6
(a) Lighting of the site shall be of a type, design, color, height and intensity to
blend with the site and landscaping, but in no case shall light poles be
taller than 20 feet measured from ground level.
(b) Lighting of the site shall be of a design and height and be located and/or
shielded so as to illuminate only the site and not be a beacon of
distraction or potential hazard to traffic or to people working or living in the
vicinity of the site and, specifically, the individual light source and the
direct radiation from lights with wattage greater than 150 shall not be
visible from adjacent streets or residential property unless specifically
approved by the Plan Commission.
(7) STANDARD NO. SD-7
Signage of uses and buildings on the site shall be limited by the Plan
Commission in number, size, height and type so as not to detract from the
visual attractiveness of the site or architecture, or be a distraction to the
traveling public or the neighborhood in general. (See section 17.0700)
e. Building Design Standards
Standards must be related to the various Principles which, in turn, are related to
the overall Objective which, in this case, is to "Heighten the visual character of
sites and buildings in the City of Pewaukee". It should be noted that the visual
aspects of building design are difficult to relate to quantitative standards and,
therefore, many of the building design standards must be qualitative. Following
are both quantitative and qualitative standards related to the visual aspects of
building construction which will be used by the Plan Commission in the review of
every site plan or development.
(1) STANDARD NO. BD-1
Principle and accessory buildings presented for review shall be carefully
designed so as to compatibly integrate architectural style, size, shape, building
material, color and texture, landscaping, lighting and signage.
(2) STANDARD NO. BD-2
(a) All buildings on a property shall be designed to integrate the principal
building materials, color and texture on all sides of the buildings.
(b) Each side of a building shall be designed to be individually visibly
pleasing.
(3) STANDARD NO. BD-3
(a) The number of materials, textures or colors that visually change the
appearance of the building shall be limited to no more than three.
(b) Painted, unpainted or anodized metal panels used as a facade material
shall not be extended or have the appearance of extending to within four
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 17 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
(4) feet of the ground elevation and shall comprise no more than ten (10)
percent of the facade of any side of a building.
(c) Bright or fluorescent colors which attract or detract the eye shall not be
used except as incidental trim comprising no more than 5 percent of the
facade of any side.
(4) STANDARD NO. BD-4
(a) Architectural types or styles which are unorthodox or which are
considered to be incompatible with surrounding buildings shall not be
allowed, except where adjacent buildings or structures do not meet the
standards.
(b) Buildings constructed within a development shall not be so similar in
exterior appearance that they appear to be the duplicate of the other
unless placed on different horizontal planes or widely different vertical
elevations.
(5) STANDARD NO. BD-5
(a) Building appurtenances such as loading docks, solid waste storage
areas, and mechanical or utility equipment shall not be located on the
street side of any building and shall be permanently screened from
general view on all other sides (or roofs) of the building by use of
compatible building materials, dense landscaping or both.
(b) Building landscaping, lighting and signage shall be presented as an
integral part of the building design and shall not be so large or distinct as
to detract from the architecture of the building.
(6) STANDARD NO. BD-6
Structural expansion or rehabilitation of existing buildings shall be designed to
comply with the standards set forth herein.
f. Overriding considerations
The foregoing standards are required to be met by all builders and developers
in the City of Pewaukee. In certain or specific situations, however, the strict
application or adherence to established standards is not possible. For
example, where a physical hardship would be created by strict adherence to a
standard and where there is no alternative which could meet the standards,
good sense would dictate that the specific standard be reduced or, perhaps,
waived by the Plan Commission or Common Council in that individual case.
Following are a series of considerations which may be reviewed and, if found
to apply to a specific situation should be applied and, thereby, either override
or enhance the standard(s) involved in that specific case:
(1) The natural terrain of a site may be so diverse or severe that total
adherence to pertinent standards is not possible. In such cases the
standard should be met to the extent possible or a suitable alternative
found as approved by the Plan Commission.
(2) The landscaping of a site and even the fencing and building structures on
the site should be so arranged as to attractively screen from the general
view of the traveling public those areas on the site not enclosed within a
building which are not inherently attractive, such as auto parking areas,
truck and construction equipment parking areas, large paved areas, trash
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 18 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
receptacles, building related mechanical equipment, above-ground utility
facilities, and raw material storage.
(3) In most cases the use of one or two building materials, or colors or
textures is sufficient to establish the visual character of a building. In a
limited number of cases the design of the building requires the use of
several exterior materials, each of which, in turn, may have differing
textures and colors. In such cases care must be taken by the
designer/builder/developer to clearly identify the necessity for such
diversion from the standards.
(4) Many types of totally or partially metal-clad buildings do not give the
visual impression of permanence and, in addition, such buildings are
often vulnerable to both physical and visual decay within a relatively short
period. There are those cases, however, where buildings have been or
may be designed using special metallic panels which are at once both
durable and visually attractive and not merely an inexpensive method of
building construction. In such cases, when it can be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission that a building having more than ten
(10) percent of the building facade covered with such metal panels is both
attractive and provides a visual permanence within the community, the
Plan Commission may reduce or waive those standards which relate to
such cases.
(5) In some cases the existing buildings in a partially developed area do not
meet the standards set forth herein or have deteriorated to such an extent
that they are visually displeasing and may even appear blighted or
dilapidated. In such cases the introduction into the area of a new building
which meets the standards, may appear to be incompatible with the
existing development but should be construed as the initial
redevelopment of the area even though not in visual conformance with its
surroundings.
(6) The arrangement of like or similar structures on a site or on contiguous
parcels at different elevations, different planes, or at different angles may
visually change the appearance of the individual structure. Such
arrangement should be carefully considered in the review of building
plans. On the other hand, simply changing the facade color, texture or
material on like or similar buildings may not be sufficient to change the
overall exterior appearance. Also, the Plan Commission, in reviewing
plans for a development proposal encompassing several buildings, may
find it desirable for the buildings to have the same architectural style or
the same exterior building materials in order to visually tie the individual
buildings to each other to form a cohesive grouping or cluster.
(7) In specifically defined sections of neighborhoods (called subneighborhoods)
or arterial street or highway corridors, it may be in the
special or increased interest of the City to establish site and/or building
standards that are more stringent than the standards set forth in previous
subsections of this ordinance. When it is deemed necessary to establish
more stringent standards in specific areas of the City for a specifically
defined purpose(s), the Plan Commission shall publish a notice and hold
a public hearing pursuant to Section 17.1300 to hear comments and
questions regarding the proposed standards after which the Plan
Commission shall make a recommendation to the Common Council.
Following such recommendation, the Common Council may adopt the
standards as proposed; reject the proposed standards; or, adopt the
proposed standards with modification. Special standards so adopted
shall take effect immediately following posting of a Common Council
resolution enacting such special standards. Special standards so
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 19 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
adopted shall be in effect within the prescribed area until such time as
they are rescinded or changed by the Common Council after a public
hearing is conducted following the same procedures as set forth above.
17.0211 REDUCTION OR JOINT USE
No lot, yard, parking area, building area, or other space shall be reduced in area or
dimension so as to not meet the provisions of this ordinance. No part of any lot,
yard, parking area, or other space required for a principal and accessory
structure(s) or use shall be used for any other structure or use.
SECTION 17.0300 PERMIT AND IMPACT FEES
17.0301 PERMIT FEES

17.0435 F-1, FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT. (Rep. & Rec. 08-12, 12-12, 14-14)
The F-1, Floodplain District is intended to preserve in essentially open space and natural land
use, through land use zoning regulation, lands which are unsuitable for intensive development
purposes due to poor natural soil conditions and periodic flood inundation and shall include all
land and water area lying within the designated Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) which
encompasses the delineated forecast 100 - year recurrence interval (one percent chance in a
year) floodplain as shown on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps (also
called the regional flood or base flood) and those land and water areas designated by FEMA
as Zone A areas. Also included within the F-1, Floodplain are those areas adjacent to the base
flood designated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WisDNR) as Flood
Storage Districts (FSDs). The proper regulation of these areas will serve to maintain and
improve water quality, prevent flood damage, protect wildlife habitat, and prohibit the location of
walled structures, as defined herein, on lands, which are generally not suitable for such use due
to possible flooding.
a. FINDING OF FACT
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of the City would impair the
public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
b. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(1) Protect life, health and property;
(2) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(3) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(4) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(6) Eliminate the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(7) Eliminate the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(8) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts
between property owners; and
(9) Eliminate development in a floodplain, recognizing that there may be existing developed
land lying within the delineated F-1, Floodplain District and there may be the need to
locate public utilities or streets within the F-1, Floodplain District.
c. TITLE
This sub-section of the City Zoning Ordinance shall be commonly known as the Floodplain
Ordinance for the City of Pewaukee, Wisconsin.
d. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
This sub-section of the City Zoning Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in
Sections 62.23 and 87.30 of Wisconsin Statutes as well as Ch. NR 116 of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code which is included as Appendix 5 in this zoning ordinance.
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 92 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
e. GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR such
as the WisDNR Flood Storage Districts (FSDs). Base flood elevations (BFE) are derived
from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and
AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones.
Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map
or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of the SFHA are designated on the maps listed in (3) below. Any change
to the BFE or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on
the FIRM must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of
Map Change process (see 17.0435t Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to
RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps,
profiles and revisions are on file in the City Planning, Public Works or Building Inspection
offices at Pewaukee City Hall and may also be available in the Waukesha County Park and
Land Use Department offices in the Courthouse. If more than one map or revision is
referenced for the same area, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(3) OFFICIAL MAPS AND PROFILES: Based on the FIS:
Official FIRMs and Profiles Encompassing the City of Pewaukee are FIRM panel
numbers:55133C0181G, 55133C0182G, 55133C0183G, 55133C0184G,

the flood storage districts as depicted on Waukesha County Wisconsin Flood
Storage District Map Panels 3, 5 and 6, based on a WisDNR study dated
November 5, 2014. Prepared and Approved by WisDNR.
(5). ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN ZONING DISTRICT
The F-1, Floodplain as defined in this City Zoning Ordinance includes:
All land and water area lying within the boundary of the SFHA as defined above plus
any FSD.
(6) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field
conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference
exists, the map shall be amended according to section 17.0435t Amendments. The zoning
administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land
use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be
responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon
which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required
under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the
district boundary line shall be settled according to section 17.1007 and the criteria in (a) and
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 93 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
(b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a
FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section t
Amendments of this sub-section.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the
district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any
discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale.
(7) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land
from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended
pursuant to section t Amendments of this sub-section.
In addition, no floodplain may be filled and no walled structure built within the SFHA or FSDs
with the exception of the construction of public utility and transportation facilities required by
a unit/agency of government, or an approved structure requiring water frontage which would
require adherence to regulations as set forth in section l of this subsection and by FEMA
and NR116. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the F-1, Floodplain District unless:
(a) Said land has been previously filled prior to the effective date of the adoption on
this amendment so that the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of
any existing or proposed walled structure or building is at least two feet above the
base flood elevation;
(b) The proposed filled land does not form an island and can be accessed from other
surrounding lands without entering the F-1, Floodplain District;
(c) There is an area of land outside the F-1, Floodplain District but adjacent to and on
the same property as the proposed filled land equal to at least four (4) times the
areal extent and volume of the proposed filled area that is added to the F-1,
Floodplain District based on plans approved by the City Plan Commission;
(d) The height of the downstream base flood is not increased by proposed fill;
(e) The floodplain boundaries shown on all official maps are amended pursuant to
section n of this sub-section; and
(f) A study is prepared and certified by a state registered professional engineer,
establishing that:
i. The fill, lowest floor and floodproofing elevation shall have no effect upon the
base flood elevation either upstream or downstream and are in compliance
with this ordinance; or
ii. The fill, lowest floor and floodproofing elevations may have the effect of
raising the base flood elevation either upstream or downstream if otherwise in
compliance with this ordinance, in which case the property owner must also
contact FEMA to request and receive an approved Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR) prior to issuance of any local permit(s); or
iii. The fill, lowest floor and floodproofing elevations may have the effect of
lowering the base flood elevation either upstream or downstream and are
otherwise in compliance with this ordinance, in which case the property owner
must also contact FEMA to request and receive an approved Letter of Map
Change (LOMC) prior to issuance of any local permit(s). Please also see subsection
17.1108b and Appendix 5.

(11) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum
requirements liberally construed in favor of the City and are not a limitation on or repeal of
any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance or ch.
NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the
standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of
the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(12) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and
scientific research related to a 100 year recurrence interval flood event (one percent change

material when separate from an approved: site or building construction
activity or general land development; stream course changing; waterway
construction or enlargement; removal of stream or lake bed materials;
channel clearing, ditching, dredging; and, the building of ponds and
lagoons and soil and water conservation structures provided that such
uses, once approved, are regulated by the City engineer or building
inspector so as to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to least disturb
or impact the natural fauna, flora, watercourse, water regimen, and
topography. The City Plan Commission may request a review of each
earth moving project proposal by the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers and
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Also see sub-section

CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
Please note: Any request for a conditional use permit must be
accompanied by graphic and written plans for review by the Plan
Commission, and in such detail as required by the Plan Commission.
(See section 17.0500)
c. Additional Restrictions Applicable to Shoreland Areas (Rep. & Rec. 14-03)
(1) Vegetation Buffer Zone. Shoreland property that contains
vegetation shall maintain that vegetation in a buffer zone along the
entire shoreline of the property and extending no less than 35 feet
inland from the OHWM. Removal of all vegetation may be
undertaken if the buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or
diseased vegetation but shall be replaced with non-invasive
vegetation.
(2) Vegetation Clearing. Vegetation clearing within 75 feet of any
designated lake or navigable stream or within the base flood
floodplain of such waters is prohibited except for approved uses
and activities as follows: park site development; access road, path
or trail construction; required utilities; timber stand improvement;
customary dead tree removal, trimming, and managed timber
harvesting under a state District Foresters plan; or a viewing or
access corridor. Such activity, when reviewed and approved by
both the City Planner and City Engineer, shall not exceed an area
equivalent to 30 percent of the property and shall be conducted so
as to prevent erosion and sedimentation, preserve and improve
scenic qualities and, during foliation, substantially screen any
development of the property from stream or lake users. Viewing or
access corridors shall not be greater than 30 feet wide for every
100 feet of shoreline frontage and shall not extend more than 35
feet inland from the OHWM. Viewing and access corridors do not
have to be reviewed by the City Planner or Engineer. Paths and
trails shall not exceed eight (8) feet in width and shall be so
designed and constructed as to result in the least possible
disruption, impairment or loss of shoreland cover, and water runoff
absorption, and natural beauty. (See sub-section 17.0208 and NR
115).
(3) Earth moving on individual parcels such as site grading, ditching,
incidental filling of less than 15 cubic yards of earth materials, and
temporary topsoil stockpiling require a permit issued by the City
Engineer when conducted as a separate activity from approved
land development or building construction and after
recommendation by the City Planner. Such activity shall not be a
visual eyesore, shall not change drainage capacity or direction and
shall not cause erosion or other hazard. The City Engineer and
City Planner in their review of a request for permit may request that
the Plan Commission review and take action on the matter. (see
NR 115 and 117, sub-sections 17.0208 and 17.0435).
(4) Earth moving such as related to land development proposals,
alteration of waterways, removal of stream or lake bed materials,
channel clearing, dredging, construction of ponds or lagoons, road
cutting, drainage ditching, construction of soil/water conservation
structures, topsoil or other earth material mining, and long-term or
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 118 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
continuous fill operations require a permit issued by the City
Engineer after review and approval of the City Plan Commission, in
addition to any other regulatory agency having jurisdiction. The
Plan Commission, in their review, may place conditions and
limitations on such activities or, following their review may require
that because the activity is of such magnitude or importance a
conditional use permit is required and/or a cash bond or letter of
credit is required to ensure performance and restoration. (See NR
115, section 17.0500 and sub-sections 17.0208 and 17.0435)
(5) Structure Setbacks. No structure except necessary streets or
access ways, utilities, navigational aids, piers and boat launch
facilities, parking areas, approved boathouses, and principal
buildings shall be located within 75 feet of a designated 100 year
recurrence interval (base flood) floodplain of any lake or navigable
stream or within 50 feet of an OHWM or officially designated
wetland, unless there are existing principal use structures on
adjoining parcels, in which case the setback from the OHWM or
base flood elevation may be an average of setbacks on the
adjoining parcels but no less than 35 feet. (See subsection
17.0435p for definition of base flood). In this subdivision,
principal building shall mean the main building or structure on a
single lot or parcel of land and includes any attached garage or
attached porch.
(6) Tilling, grazing, livestock watering and application of nonphosphorous
fertilizers on agricultural zoned lands may be allowed
within 75 feet of a designated wetland or navigable stream or body
of water only if conducted in accordance with City, county and state
regulations designed to safeguard the health and welfare of
animals, aquatic life and the natural environment.
d. Impervious Surface Restrictions and Mitigation Requirements.
The man-made material coverage of lots/parcels within close proximity to navigable
waterways shall be restricted as follows:
(1) The total building coverage or footprint of permanent structures* on a
parcel of land located within 1,000 feet of a lake of the state shall be:
(a) No more than 20 percent of the total area of a parcel located within
300 feet of the OHWM or base flood elevation of a lake, whichever is
greater; and,
(b) No more than 30 percent of the total area of a parcel located between
300 and 1,000 feet of the OHWM or base flood elevation of a lake,
whichever is greater.
(2) The total building coverage or footprint of permanent structures* on a
parcel of land located within 300 feet of the OHWM or base flood
elevation of a navigable stream, whichever is greater, shall be no more
than 20 percent of the total area of the parcel.
(3) The permanent impervious surfaces such as driveways, parking areas,
walkways, patios, ground level decks, ramps, tennis and other sports
courts, fountains or pools located outside the footprint of permanent
structures* on a parcel of land within 1,000 feet of the OHWM or base
flood elevation of a lake, whichever is greater, or within 300 feet of the
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 119 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
OHWM or base flood elevation of a navigable stream, whichever is
greater, and made of such materials as: asphalt, concrete, stone, bricks,
gravel, traffic bond, wood, metal, plastic, compacted construction clay or
other like impervious material, shall total no more than 10 percent of the
total area of a parcel less than 10,000 square feet in area and no more
than seven and one-half (7-1/2%) percent of parcels of 10,000 square
feet or more in area.
(4) The total combined coverage of permanent structures* and permanent
impervious surfaces outside the structures may be increased up to a total of
35 percent when the parcel is located within 300 feet of the OHWM or base
flood elevation of either a lake or navigable stream whichever is greater,
and may be increased to a total of 40 percent when the parcel is located
between 300 and 1,000 feet of the OHWM or base flood elevation of a lake,
whichever is greater, if the parcel owner(s) reaches a written agreement
with the City to mitigate such increased impervious coverage by putting in
place measures such as the following:
(a) The planting of coniferous and deciduous trees and shrubs on the
waterway side of buildings and structures; the construction of
earthworks, rain gardens, terraces and detention/retention ponds to
permanently retard water runoff, soil erosion and siltation from the
property; the planting of ground cover and prairie like grasses on the
down-slope side of buildings and structures that will retard water
runoff, soil erosion and siltation; and, the establishment of natural
growth wildlife habitat areas on the property.
(b) Any or all such mitigation measures shall be made for the purpose of
limiting the effect the man-made disturbance of the property may have
on the nearby waterway, adjoining properties and the environment
and, as determined and directed by the City Plan Commission, shall
be proportional to the amount of impervious surface added beyond
the total area allowed under d(1), (2) or (3), above. Such mitigation
measure requirements shall be recorded in the minutes of a City Plan
Commission meeting and shall also be recorded by the County
Register of Deeds as a property deed restriction for/on the property in
question.
(5) In no case shall lands lying within 300 feet of the OHWM or base flood
elevation of a lake or a navigable stream, whichever is greater, have less
than 65 percent of the parcel covered with natural grasses and vegetation
and/or aforementioned mitigation measures. Likewise, in no case shall
lands lying between 300 and 1,000 feet of the OHWM or base flood
elevation of a lake, whichever is greater, have less than 60 percent of the
parcel covered with natural grasses and vegetation and/or aforementioned
mitigation measures.

CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
SECTION 17.0450 FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED ADULT-ORIENTED
ESTABLISHMENTS (Cr. 13-06)
17.0451 FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED ADULT-ORIENTED
ESTABLISHMENTS
1. The Council finds that Adult-Oriented Establishments, as defined and
otherwise regulated by the City in its Adult-Oriented Licensing and
Regulation Ordinance, require special zoning in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the City.
2. Based its review of a summary of studies conducted in Phoenix AZ,
Garden Grove CA, Los Angeles CA, Whittier CA, Indianapolis IN,
Minneapolis MN, St. Paul MN, Cleveland OH, Oklahoma City OK,
Amarillo TX, Austin TX, Beaumont TX, Houston TX, Seattle WA, and the
findings incorporated in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc.,
427 U.S. 50 (1976), the Council finds that there is convincing evidence
that the secondary effects of Adult-Oriented Establishments include an
increased risk of prostitution, high-risk sexual behavior, crime, and other
deleterious effects upon existing businesses and surrounding residential
areas, and property values.
3. The Council intends to control the impact of these secondary effects
in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect
the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and areas.
4. It is not the intent of the Council to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral
ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of Adult-Oriented
Establishments while providing an outlet for First Amendment protected
activities.
5. In order to minimize and control the secondary effects of Adult-
Oriented Establishments upon the City, it is the intent of the Council to
prevent the concentration of Adult-Oriented Establishments within a
certain distance of each other and within a certain distance of other
specified locations which are incompatible with and would suffer from the
secondary effects of Adult-Oriented Establishments.
6. Based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and
high-risk sexual behavior and materials linking alcohol consumption and
crimes such as sexual assault, the Council finds that a geographic
separation of Adult-Oriented Establishments from alcohol beverage
licensed premises is warranted.
17.0452 DEFINITIONS
Adult-oriented establishment as used in this subdivision includes: Adult
Arcade, Adult Bathhouse, Adult Body Painting Studio, Adult Bookstore,
Adult Cabaret, Adult Massage Parlor, Adult Motel, Adult Theater, and any

measurements from an AOE structure shall be taken from the farthest point
the structure extends in the direction of the measurement, including
overhanging roofs or similar projections.
3. For Adult-Oriented Establishments located in conjunction with other
buildings but clearly separate from other establishments such as in multitenant
buildings, measurements shall be taken from the boundaries of the
space occupied by the Adult-Oriented Establishment.
4. For any Adult-Oriented Establishment located above ground level in a
multi-story structure and clearly separate from other establishments within
the structure, the distance measurements shall be taken from the ground
floor public entrance/exit nearest the Adult-Oriented Establishment
(excluding emergency exits).
5. A licensed Adult-Oriented Establishment is not disqualified from
holding an Adult-Oriented Establishment License by the location
subsequent to the grant or renewal of its license of any of the establishments
described in herein within 600 feet of the licensed premises. This
provision applies only to the renewal of an existing license and does not
apply when an application for a license is submitted after a license for that
location has not been renewed or has been revoked.

SECTION 17.0700 SIGNS AND GRAPHICS
17.0701 INTENT AND PURPOSE
The intent of this section is to provide for and regulate the location and safe
construction of signs in the City in a manner that will ensure that such signs are
compatible with surrounding land uses, are aesthetic in design and structure and
express the identity of individual proprietors and the community as a whole. It is
the further intent that by these regulations, the community will be spared the
presence of visual clutter and distraction along its thoroughfares by the display of
multiple signs on the same property or on adjacent parcels with near identical
content while at the same time ensuring that no property owner is denied his/her
right to visually communicate in a regulated, aesthetic and morally responsible
manner. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to locate, erect,
move, reconstruct, extend, enlarge, convert, or structurally alter any sign without
first complying with the requirements of this section. All signs shall be maintained
and kept in good repair. Signs intended to be permanent must be structurally
affixed to a building, structure or a ground mounting and constructed of materials
that are permanent in nature. All other signs are classified as temporary signs.
Lighting and landscaping of permanent signs must be accomplished to the
satisfaction of the Plan Commission. Certain types of signs may be prohibited as
set forth in subsection 17.0708.
17.0702 SIGNS PERMITTED IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS WITHOUT A PERMIT
Certain signs are permitted on private property in all zoning districts without a
permit as may be set forth in the individual district regulations. No sign, however,
may be located within a public right of way or on public lands without written
permission of the public body having jurisdiction. No sign shall be erected on any
property without a vision triangle at street intersections. Signs erected in violation
of the regulations in this section may be removed without notice. (See sub-section
17.0708) The following signs may be permitted in any zoning district without
permit:
a. Memorial Sign, Tablet, Name of Building and Date of Erection Sign when cut
into any masonry surface or when constructed of metal and affixed flat against
a structure and not illuminated, thereby rendering them permanent signs.
b. Any Official Sign such as traffic control, parking restrictions, public information
and notices, not exceeding six (6) feet in height unless extended over public
right-of-way by use of a cantilevered pole or structure, when authorized by the
City. Portable temporary traffic warning or control equipment may be used by
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 129 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
the City or County emergency personnel or authorized highway construction
crews within public rights-of-way without a permit.
c. Election Campaign Signs. Election campaign signs may be allowed in any
district without a permit provided that permission shall be obtained from the
property owner, renter, or lessee; and provided that such sign shall not be
erected for more than the election campaign period (Wis. Stat. 12.04), and
removed within seven (7) days following the election. Such signs in residential
zoning districts shall not exceed 16 square feet on each sign face per sign,
unless located on a county or state trunk highway or City designated arterial
street, in which case the maximum sign area may be increased to 32 square
feet; may not exceed six (6) feet in height; and, may not exceed a total of 32
square feet per lot. To avoid sign clutter and visual distraction, individual signs
more than four square feet in area should be spaced apart from other signs on
the property at least 30 feet. No such sign shall be placed on public lands,
within public rights-of-way without permission of the unit or agency of
government having jurisdiction and if so placed without such permission will be
subject to removal without notice.
d. A Short Term Temporary Sign advertising such neighborhood or communitywide
coming activities or events as: a garage sale; a civic organizations annual
picnic, bicycle race or boat race; a grand opening; a final close out; a church
raffle, picnic or ice cream social; or, a community or county annual fair or
outing. Because such signs are intended to be temporary and, therefore, are
usually not constructed of materials that will withstand wind, rain and snow
conditions for long periods of time, they should be erected for only a short
period of time in advance of the event and shall be removed within seven (7)
days following the advertised event or activity. The signs shall conform to the
size, height and location restrictions in section 17.0702c, above. No such sign
shall be placed on public lands, within the rights of way of public streets or
highways without written permission of the unit or agency of government
having jurisdiction and if so placed without such permission will be subject to
removal without notice. (Also see 17.0708).
e. Real estate For Sale or For Lease sign. Such signs on an individual
residential parcel shall not exceed 16 square feet in sign face area or, if related
to an entire residential subdivision or development plat, may not exceed 32
square feet in area. Such signs in other zoning districts may not exceed 32
square feet in area. If such signs are illuminated a permit issued by the
Building Inspector is required. Only one sign will be permitted for each street
or lake frontage and must be placed on the property involved. Because such
signs, though temporary, might be in place for a long period of time, such signs
should be constructed of durable material and shall be maintained in good
repair and must be removed within seven (7) days following the sale or lease of
the individual building parcel or, if a multi-parcel development, the initial sale or
lease of the last parcel in the development. The City may order removal or
replacement of signs that are in disrepair. Such signs may not be erected in a
location that will block vision of motorists at intersecting streets or at driveways.
No such sign may be more than eight (8) feet in height and no such sign may
advertise for sale or for lease land or property other than the premises on
which the sign is located. (Also see sub-section 17.0708).
f. Small, Permanent On-Site Traffic Directional Signs erected within private
development and not more than nine (9) square feet in area and not more than
five (5) feet high.

CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
17.0703 SIGNS PERMITTED IN INDIVIDUAL ZONING DISTRICTS WITH A PERMIT
The following signs may be permitted in any specific zoning district after application
and issuance of a permit by the Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator. No
sign, however, may be located within a public right of way or on public lands
without written permission of the public body having jurisdiction or on any property
within a vision triangle of intersecting streets and if so erected or placed in
violation of the regulations in this section may be removed without notice. (Also
see 17.0708).
a. Permanent Bulletin Board for public, charitable or religious institutions not to
exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in sign area, eight (8) feet in height and
located on the premises of the institutional use. Such signs shall be set back
from the property line at least one-quarter (1/4) of the building setback
requirements of the District in which the property is located and be illuminated
only to the extent necessary to permit reading of the sign from a maximum
distance of 10 feet. Such signs may have a portion of the sign devoted to
words and numbers that are changeable by hand and are not larger than four
(4) inches in height.
b. Temporary Sign or Banner, other than those allowed under sub-section
17.0702. For purposes of this section a temporary sign or banner is one which
will be used for no more than sixty (60) days in a six (6) calendar month period,
measured from the date the sign is erected. In order to avoid visual clutter of
multiple signs only one such sign or banner may be placed on a property street
frontage. Such signs shall not exceed 16 square feet in area in residential
districts, 32 square feet in sign area in all other districts when placed on the
property line abutting a minor, collector or standard arterial street, or up to 100
square feet in sign area when placed on commercial or industrial zoned
property and at least 100 feet from the edge of the nearest through traffic lane
of an expressway or freeway; shall be attached to the principle building or be
erected as a ground sign no more than eight (8) feet in height in an aesthetic
and structurally sound manner and shall meet all setback regulations as set
forth in this section. Portable signs with or without wheels and signs on trucks,
trailers or other vehicles that are parked on public or private property with the
intent to be used for temporary or permanent advertisement purposes are not
in keeping with the aesthetic requirements of this ordinance and are, therefore,
not allowed.
17.0704 SIGNS PERMITTED IN AGRICULTURAL ZONING DISTRICTS WITH A PERMIT
The following signs are permitted in Agricultural Zoning Districts upon the issuance
of a permit by the Building Inspector or Zoning Administrator, and subject to the

square feet in sign area, six (6) feet in height, and not exceeding one (1) sign
per 450 feet of street or highway frontage. No such sign may be erected on

intersecting streets.
b. For Sale or For Lease/rent sign pertaining to the sale or lease of a farm
building or the sale of farm produce raised on the farm, farm equipment or
animals. Such signs shall not exceed six (6) feet in height; may be located on
the property line up to 25 square feet in area and must be set back from the

square feet up to 50 square feet in area; and, shall not exceed one (1) sign per
street frontage. No such sign shall be erected or maintained within an inside
curve of a highway unless such signs are placed at least fifty (50) feet from the
highway right-of-way and further than fifty (50) feet from the right-of-way as
may be necessary to prevent such sign from interfering with vision along the
highway for a distance of at least one thousand (1,000) feet in each direction
by those traveling thereon. Such signs are considered temporary signs and
shall be removed no later than seven (7) days after closing of the sale or lease
and the permit for such sign shall expire on June 30th each year unless
extended for a specific period of time by official action of the Zoning
Administrator or Plan Commission.

maintenance shall not be considered grounds for their continued use. If not kept in
good repair to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector, the Building Inspector may
require removal of the sign within a 60 day period. The owners of signs which are

From time to time the Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector may inspect signs
within the City for compliance with the provisions of this Section and if such

request that the sign be made to comply with this Section. If, within a reasonable
period of time set by the Building Inspector (see Sections 17.0712 and 17.0713),
the sign is not made to comply with this Section, the Building Inspector may direct
that the sign be removed by the owner, and if not so removed shall cause the sign

restoring, repainting, or replacement of a worn or damaged legally existing sign to
its original condition, and shall maintain the premises on which the sign is erected
in a clean, sanitary, and inoffensive condition, free and clear of all obnoxious
substances, rubbish, weeds, and grass. Failure to do so after notice from the
Building Inspector shall be cause for the removal of such signs under sub-section
17.0714. Whenever the Building Inspector determines that the cost to repair a sign
will exceed 50% of its replacement cost, such sign shall be deemed a hazard and
the Building Inspector shall order its removal as set forth in sub-section 17.0714.
This Section shall apply to both new and legal nonconforming signs.
17.0716 SIGN CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
a. Wind Pressure and Dead Load Requirements: All permanent signs and other

foot of area, and shall be constructed to receive dead loads as required in the
City Building Code or other Ordinances.
b. Protection of the Public: The temporary occupancy of a sidewalk or street or
other public property during construction, removal, repair, alteration, or
maintenance of a sign is permitted provided the space occupied is roped off,
fenced off, or otherwise isolated to prevent hazard to pedestrians and property.
c. Supporting Members or Braces of all signs shall be constructed of galvanized
iron, properly treated wood, stainless steel, or other non-corrosive, noncombustible

cable, or other metal attachments as shall ensure permanent and safe
construction and shall be maintained free from defects, rust or other
deterioration. Every means or device used for attaching any sign shall extend
through the walls of the building should the Building Inspector determine that
the safe and permanent support of such sign so requires and shall be securely
anchored by wall plates and nuts to the inside of the walls or to bearings on the
underside of two (2) or more roof or ceiling joists in accordance with instruction
given by the Building Inspector. Small, flat signs containing less than 10
square feet of area may be attached to a building by the use of non-corrosive
lag bolts or other means to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector.
d. No Signs, or any part thereof, or sign anchors, braces, or guide rods shall be
attached, fastened, or anchored to any fire escape, fire ladder, or stand pipe,

CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
SECTION 17.0800 NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
17.0801 EXISTING NONCONFORMING USES
The lawful nonconforming use* of a structure, land, or water existing at the time of
the adoption or amendment of this ordinance may be continued although the use
does not conform with the provisions of this ordinance, however:
a. Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued in such
use and the structure(s) housing the non-conforming use may not be extended,
enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved or otherwise structurally altered if
it thereby extends or enlarges the non-conforming use, except when required
to do so by law or order, or in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.
b. Total Lifetime Structural Repair of the structure housing the non-conforming
use shall not exceed 50 percent of the City assessed value of the structure
unless the use is permanently changed to conform to the use provisions of this
Ordinance.
c. Substitution of New Equipment may be permitted if such equipment will not
increase the incompatibility of the nonconforming use.
17.0802 ABOLISHMENT OR REPLACEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING USES AND
STRUCTURES
If a nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 months, any
future use of the structure, land or water shall conform to the provisions of this
ordinance. When a nonconforming use or structure is damaged by fire, explosion,
flood, the public enemy, or other calamity to the extent of 50 or more percent of its
current assessed value, it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use
and structural provisions of this ordinance. A file of all nonconforming uses shall
be maintained by the Zoning Administrator listing the following: Owners name and
address; use of the structure, land, or water; and assessed value at the time of its
becoming a nonconforming use.
17.0803 EXISTING NONCONFORMING LAND AREAS
Lots or parcels of land which do not conform to the minimum area, size and/or
shape requirements of this ordinance at the time of its passage may be allowed to
be built upon so long as such parcels and the structures to be built meet all other
requirements of this ordinance.
17.0804 EXISTING NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
The lawful nonconforming structure(s) existing at the time of the adoption of or
amendment to this ordinance may be continued although the structure, its size,
dimensions, footprint or location does not conform with the lot width, or lot area
coverage, setback or yard, or height, or parking and loading, or access provisions
of this ordinance or the City building code; however, such structures shall not be
extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or otherwise structurally altered except
when required to do so by law or order; or, in compliance with the provisions of this
or any other City ordinance. (Also see sub-section 17.0806)
17.0805 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES IN FLOODPLAINS
Nonconforming uses or structures within a designated 100 year recurrence interval
base flood floodplain which are repaired or altered under the nonconforming use
provisions of this ordinance shall provide for non-fill flood-proofing of those portions
CITY OF PEWAUKEE MUNICIPAL CODE 138 of 191
CHAPTER 17  ZONING Last Revision: 10/2014
of the structures involved in such repair or alteration. Certification of non-fill flood
proofing shall be made to the Zoning Administrator and shall consist of a plan or
document certified by a registered professional engineer that the non-fill flood
proofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths,
hydrostatic pressures and other factors associated with an established 100-year
recurrence interval (base) flood. (Also see sub-section 17.0435j & p).
17.0806 NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF OLDER RESIDENTIAL
STRUCTURES
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, residential structures which
encroach upon setback and other yard requirements but which met the setback
and yard requirements at the time of original construction may be structurally
altered provided that they do not create a greater degree of encroachment.
17.0807 CHANGES AND SUBSTITUTIONS
Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform, it shall not
revert back to a nonconforming use or structure. Nonconforming structures that
are destroyed, torn down or otherwise removed may not be replaced except in
conformance with this ordinance. Also, once the Zoning Board of Appeals has
permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use or structure for
an existing nonconforming use or structure, the substituted use or structure shall
lose its status as a legal nonconforming use or structure and become subject to all
conditions required by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
17.0808 CONDITIONAL USES NOT NONCONFORMING USES
Any use for which a conditional use permit has been issued as provided in this
ordinance, shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall be deemed a
conforming use in such district because of its conditional use status.
17.0809 INADVERTANT NONCONFORMING PARCELS/STRUCTURES
If a heretofore conforming parcel or structure is made nonconforming by the action
of persons, agencies or units of government who are not owners of the parcel or
structure (such as the widening of a street or highway by government agency
action), that parcel or structure may continue to be used as if the change in
conformance status did not occur.
17.0810 EXISTING PARTIALLY NONCONFORMING PARCELS
Owners of single-family residential lots, parcels or tracts of land created prior to
August 17, 1982 which were/are in conformance with the use and area

REQUIRE PLAN COMMISSION REVIEW AND APPROVAL PRIOR TO
ISSUANCE OF A BUILDING PERMIT AND MAY REQUIRE A CONDITIONAL
USE PERMIT.
Certain accessory uses are of such a nature that they require considerable review
prior to issuance of a building permit by the Building Inspector. When the Building
Inspector (or other staff person) concludes that such proposed accessory use is
not compatible with either the principal use or the uses on adjacent property, or the
proposed accessory use does not or cannot meet the standards set forth herein,
the proposal may be referred to the Plan Commission for a determination and
direction to the Building Inspector. Such accessory uses include but are not
limited to:

b. Exceptional Circumstances: There must be exceptional, extraordinary, or
unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure,
use, or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in
the same district, and the granting of the variance should not be of so general
or recurrent nature as to suggest that the Ordinance should be changed.
c. Economic or Financial Hardship and Self-Imposed Hardship Not Grounds for
Variance: No variance shall be granted on the basis of economic/ financial
gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds for
the granting of a variance.

detriment to adjacent property or that will materially impair or be contrary to the
purpose and spirit of this Ordinance or the public interest.

(1) A change in the boundaries or elevation of the base flood floodplain (F-1
District) would result.
(2) A lower degree of flood protection than a point two (2) feet above the 100-
year recurrence interval base flood for the particular area would result.

and relief costs would be increased; and, it is contrary to the purposes of
this ordinance.
(6) Such variance would allow alteration of an historical structure and/or use.
g. When a floodplain variance is granted, the Board shall notify the applicant in
writing that it may increase risks to life and property and flood insurance
premiums could increase up to $25.00 per $100.00 per coverage. A copy shall
be maintained with the variance record.

Chapter NR 115
WISCONSINS SHORELAND PROTECTION PROGRAM
NR 115.01 Purpose.
NR 115.02 Applicability.
NR 115.03 Definitions.
NR 115.04 Shoreland-wetlands.
NR 115.05 Minimum zoning standards for shorelands.
NR 115.06 Department duties.
Note: Chapter NR 115 as it existed on July 31, 1980, was repealed and a new chapter
NR 115 was created effective August 1, 1980.
NR 115.01 Purpose. Section 281.31, Stats., provides that
shoreland subdivision and zoning regulations shall: further the
maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control
water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life;
control building sites, placement of structure and land uses and
reserve shore cover and natural beauty. Section 59.692, Stats.,
requires counties to effect the purposes of s. 281.31, Stats., and to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare by adopting
zoning regulations for the protection of all shorelands in unincorporated
areas that meet shoreland zoning standards promulgated
by the department. The purpose of this chapter is to establish
minimum shoreland zoning standards for ordinances enacted
under s. 59.692, Stats., for the purposes specified in s. 281.31 (1),
Stats., and to limit the direct and cumulative impacts of shoreland
development on water quality; near-shore aquatic, wetland and
upland wildlife habitat; and natural scenic beauty. Nothing in this
rule shall be construed to limit the authority of a county to enact
more restrictive shoreland zoning standards under s. 59.69 or
59.692, Stats., to effect the purposes of s. 281.31, Stats.
Note: Effective April 17, 2012, 2011 Wisconsin Act 170 created s. 59.692 (2m),
Stats., which prohibits a county from enacting, and a county, city, or village from
enforcing, any provision in a county shoreland or subdivision ordinance that regulates
the location, maintenance, expansion, replacement, repair, or relocation of a
nonconforming building if the provision is more restrictive than the standards for
nonconforming buildings under ch. NR 115; or the construction of a structure or
building on a substandard lot if the provision is more restrictive than the standards
for substandard lots under ch. NR 115.
2011 Wisconsin Act 170 also created other provisions that affect how a county regulates
nonconforming uses and buildings, premises, structures, or fixtures under its
general zoning ordinance.
History: Cr. Register, July, 1980, No. 295, eff. 8-1-80; reprinted to correct error,
Register, December, 1980; corrections made under s. 13.93 (2m) (b) 7., Stats., Register,
April, 2000, No. 532; CR 05-058: r. and recr. Register January 2010 No. 649, eff.
2-1-10.
NR 115.02 Applicability. The provisions of this chapter
apply to county regulation of the use and development of unincorporated
shoreland areas, and to annexed or incorporated areas
except as provided in s. 59.692 (7), Stats. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, counties and, when s.
13.48 (13), Stats., applies, state agencies are required to comply
with, and obtain all necessary permits under, local shoreland ordinances.
The construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair
of state highways and bridges carried out under the direction and
supervision of the Wisconsin department of transportation is not
subject to local shoreland zoning ordinances if s. 30.2022 (1),
Stats., applies.
Note: Under section 59.692 (7), Stats., areas annexed after May 7, 1982 and areas
incorporated after April 30, 1994 were generally subject to the county shoreland zoning
ordinances in effect on the date of annexation or incorporation. Effective December
14, 2013, 2013 Wis. Act 80 repealed s. 59.692 (2m) (c) and (7), amended s. 59.692
(6m), and created ss. 61.353 and 62.233. 2013 WI Act 80 is retroactive as well as
prospective, and applies to all shorelands areas annexed since May 7, 1982 or incorporated
since April 30, 1994.
History: Cr. Register, July, 1980, No. 295, eff. 8-1-80; am. Register, October,
1980, No. 298, eff. 11-1-80; CR 05-058: am. Register January 2010 No. 649, eff.
2-1-10; correction made under s. 13.92 (4) (b) 7., Stats., Register January 2010 No.
649.
NR 115.03 Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter:
(1d) Access and viewing corridor means a strip of vegetated
land that allows safe pedestrian access to the shore through
the vegetative buffer zone.
(1h) Boathouse means a permanent structure used for the
storage of watercraft and associated materials and includes all
structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls or any
combination of these structural parts.
(1p) Building envelope means the three dimensional space
within which a structure is built.
(2) County zoning agency means that committee or commission
created or designated by the county board under s. 59.69
(2) (a), Stats., to act in all matters pertaining to county planning
and zoning.
(3) Department means the department of natural resources.
(3m) Existing development pattern means that principal
structures exist within 250 feet of a proposed principal structure
in both directions along the shoreline.
(4) Flood plain means the land which has been or may be
hereafter covered by flood water during the regional flood. The
flood plain includes the floodway and the flood fringe as those
terms are defined in ch. NR 116.
(4g) Impervious surface means an area that releases as runoff
all or a majority of the precipitation that falls on it. Impervious
surface excludes frozen soil but includes rooftops, sidewalks,
driveways, parking lots, and streets unless specifically
designed, constructed, and maintained to be pervious.
(4r) Mitigation means balancing measures that are
designed, implemented and function to restore natural functions
and values that are otherwise lost through development and
human activities.
(5) Navigable waters means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan,
all natural inland lakes within Wisconsin and all streams, ponds,
sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of
this state, including the Wisconsin portion of boundary waters,
which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under s. 281.31
(2) (d), Stats., notwithstanding any other provision of law or
administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland ordinances
required under s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter do not
apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:
(a) Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream
or river;
(b) Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands
were nonnavigable streams before ditching or had no previous
stream history; and
(c) Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.
Note: In Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952), the Wisconsin
Supreme Court held that a stream is navigable in fact if it is capable of floating
any boat, skiff, or canoe, of the shallowest draft used for recreational purposes. In
DeGayner and Co., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975), the
court also held that a stream need not be navigable in its normal or natural condition
to be navigable in fact. The DeGayner opinion indicates that it is proper to consider
artificial conditions, such as beaver dams, where such conditions have existed long
enough to make a stream useful as a highway for recreation or commerce, and to consider
ordinarily recurring seasonal fluctuations, such as spring floods, in determining
the navigability of a stream.
(6) Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank
or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is

so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion,
destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance
of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.
Where the bank or shore at any particular place is of such character
that it is difficult or impossible to ascertain where the point of ordinary
high-water mark is, recourse may be had to the opposite bank
of a stream or to other places on the shore of a lake or flowage to
determine whether a given stage of water is above or below the
ordinary high-water mark.
(7) Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative
of large floods known to have generally occurred in Wisconsin
and which may be expected to occur on a particular stream
because of like physical characteristics once in every 100 years.
Note: The regional flood is based upon a statistical analysis of streamflow records
available for watershed and/or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics in the
general watershed region. The flood frequency of the regional flood is once in every
100 years. In any given year, there is a 1% chance that the regional flood may occur.
During a typical 30-year mortgage period, the regional flood has a 26% chance of
occurring.
(7m) Routine maintenance of vegetation means normally
accepted horticultural practices that do not result in the loss of any
layer of existing vegetation and do not require earth disturbance.
(8) Shorelands means lands within the following distances
from the ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters: 1,000
feet from a lake, pond or flowage; and 300 feet from a river or
stream or to the landward side of the flood plain, whichever distance
is greater.
(9) Shoreland-wetland zoning district means a zoning district,
created as a part of a county shoreland zoning ordinance,
comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the
Wisconsin wetland inventory maps prepared by the department.
(10) Special exception (conditional use) means a use which
is permitted by a shoreland zoning ordinance provided that certain
conditions specified in the ordinance are met and that a permit is
granted by the board of adjustment or, where appropriate, the
planning and zoning committee or county board.
(11) Unnecessary hardship means that circumstance where
special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not
self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing
area, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily
burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the zoning
ordinance.
(13) Wetlands means those areas where water is at, near or
above the land surface long enough to be capable of supporting
aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation, and which have soils indicative
of wet conditions.

NR 115.04 Shoreland-wetlands. (1) ESTABLISHMENT
OF SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICTS. Counties shall adopt
shoreland ordinances that include zoning regulations for
shoreland-wetland zoning districts.
(2) AMENDMENT OF SHORELAND-WETLAND MAPS AND ZONING
DISTRICTS. (a) County review of wetland inventory map amendments.
After the department amends final Wisconsin wetland
inventory maps:
1. The department shall transmit to the county zoning agency
designated under s. 59.69 (2) (a), Stats., digital files or paper copies
of amended wetland inventory maps for that county.
2. If the county believes that the amended maps are inaccurate,
within 30 days of receiving the amended maps the county
shall note discrepancies on the maps with an accompanying narrative
explaining the amended problem areas and return a copy of
the notated map and narrative to the department.
3. The department shall, at department expense, consult
available soil survey maps and conduct on-site inspections, if
appropriate, in order to evaluate the county recommendations,
and shall then prepare final amended Wisconsin wetland inventory
maps for that county.
Note: As of 1985 all counties adopted official wetland zoning maps and amendments
occur as accuracy increases.
(b) County amendment of shoreland-wetland maps and zoning
districts. 1. Within 6 months after receipt of final amended
Wisconsin wetland inventory maps for that county from the
department, a county shall zone all shorelands designated as wetlands
on the amended Wisconsin wetland inventory maps in a
shoreland-wetland zoning district. If a county fails to zone all
shoreland-wetlands within this 6 month period, s. NR 115.06 (3)
(b) shall apply.
2. Ordinance text and map amendments creating or amending
shoreland-wetland zoning districts shall be referred to the county
zoning agency for public hearing as required by s. 59.69 (5) (e) 2.,
Stats.
Note: Where an apparent discrepancy exists between a shoreland-wetland district
shown on an amended map and actual field conditions, the county shall contact the
department to determine if the amended map is in error. If the department determines
that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as wetland or meets the wetland definition
but was not shown as wetland on the map, the county shall have the authority to
immediately grant or deny a shoreland zoning permit in accordance with the applicable
regulations based on the department determination as to whether the area is wetland.
In order to correct wetland mapping errors on the official zoning map, an official
map amendment must be initiated within a reasonable period of time, not to
exceed one year following the determination.
3. At least 10 days prior to the public hearing, the county shall
provide the appropriate regional office of the department with a
copy of the proposed text and map amendments and with written
notice of the public hearing.
(c) Amendment of shoreland-wetland zoning districts. 1.
Official ordinance amendments are required for any proposed
change in shoreland-wetland zoning. Such amendments shall
be made in accordance with provisions of s. 59.69 (5) (e), Stats.
Official amendments to the ordinance text shall be made
promptly. Provided the ordinance text is promptly amended, a
county may amend its official map within a reasonable period of
time not to exceed one year following the change in shoreland-
wetland zoning.
2. The county clerk shall submit a copy of every proposed
amendment to a shoreland-wetland zoning district to the appropriate
regional office of the department within 5 days of the filing
of such proposed amendment with the clerk.
3. All proposed text and map amendments to shoreland-
wetland zoning districts shall be referred to the county zoning
agency for a public notice and hearing as required by s. 59.69 (5)
(e) 2., Stats. The appropriate regional office of the department
shall be provided with written notice of the public hearing at least
10 days prior to such hearing.
4. In order to ensure that the shoreland protection objectives
found in s. 281.31, Stats., will be accomplished by the county
shoreland ordinance, a county shall not rezone a shoreland-
wetland zoning district, or portion thereof, if the proposed rezoning
may result in a significant adverse impact upon any of the following:
a. Storm and flood water storage capacity;
b. Maintenance of dry season stream flow, or the discharge of
groundwater to a wetland, the recharge of groundwater from a
wetland to another area, or the flow of groundwater through a wetland;
c. Filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable
waters;
d. Shoreline protection against soil erosion;
e. Fish spawning, breeding, nursery or feeding grounds;
f. Wildlife habitat; or

g. Areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific interest,
including scarce wetland types.
5. If the department determines that the proposed rezoning
may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the criteria
listed in subd. 4., the department shall notify the county zoning
agency of its determination either prior to or during the public
hearing held on the proposed amendment.
6. As soon as possible after holding a public hearing, the
county zoning agency shall submit its written findings and recommendations
to the county board. Said findings shall outline the
reason for the agencys recommendations. After receipt of the
county zoning agencys findings and recommendations, the board
may approve or disapprove of the proposed amendment.
7. The appropriate regional office of the department shall be
provided with all of the following:
a. A copy of the county zoning agencys findings and recommendations
on the proposed amendment within 10 days after the
submission of those findings and recommendations to the county
board;
b. Written notice of the boards decision on the proposed
amendment within 10 days after it is issued.
8. If the county board approves of the proposed amendment
and the department determines, after review as required by s. NR
115.06 (2) (c), that the county shoreland zoning ordinance if so
amended would no longer comply with the requirements of s.
59.692, Stats., and this chapter, the department shall, after notice
and hearing, adopt a complying ordinance for the county, under
s. 59.692 (6), Stats.
9. If the department has notified the county zoning agency
that a proposed amendment may have a significant adverse impact
upon any of the criteria listed in subd. 4., that proposed amendment,
if approved by the county board, shall not become effective
until more than 30 days have elapsed since written notice of the
county boards approval was mailed to the department, as required
by subd. 7. If within the 30-day period the department notifies the
county board that the department intends to adopt a superseding
shoreland zoning ordinance for the county under s. 59.692 (6),
Stats., the proposed amendment shall not become effective while
the ordinance adoption procedure is proceeding, but shall have its
effect stayed until the s. 59.692 (6), Stats., procedure is completed
or otherwise terminated.
(3) PERMITTED USES IN SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICTS.
Within shoreland-wetland zoning districts, counties shall
permit the following uses subject to the general requirements of
s. NR 115.05, the provisions of chs. 30 and 31, Stats., and other
state and federal laws, if applicable:
(a) Hiking, fishing, trapping, hunting, swimming and boating.
(b) The harvesting of wild crops, such as marsh hay, ferns,

NR 115.05 Minimum zoning standards for shorelands.
(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF SHORELAND ZONING STANDARDS.
The shoreland zoning ordinance adopted by each county shall
control use of shorelands to afford the protection of water quality
as specified in chs. NR 102 and 103. At a minimum, the ordinance
shall include all of the following provisions:
(a) Minimum lot sizes. Minimum lot sizes in the shoreland area
shall be established to afford protection against danger to health,
safety and welfare, and protection against pollution of the adjacent
body of water.
1. Sewered lots. Lots served by public sanitary sewer shall
have a minimum average width of 65 feet and a minimum area of
10,000 square feet.
2. Unsewered lots. Lots not served by public sanitary sewer
shall have a minimum average width of 100 feet and a minimum
area of 20,000 square feet.
3. Substandard lots. A legally created lot or parcel that met
minimum area and minimum average width requirements when
created, but does not meet current lot size requirements, may be
used as a building site if all of the following apply:
Note: Effective April 17, 2012, 2011 Wisconsin Act 170 created s. 59.692 (2m),
Stats., which prohibits a county from enacting, and a county, city, or village from
enforcing, any provision in a county shoreland or subdivision ordinance that regulates
the construction of a structure or building on a substandard lot if the provision
is more restrictive than the standards for substandard lots under ch. NR 115.
a. The substandard lot or parcel was never reconfigured or
combined with another lot or parcel by plat, survey, or consolidation
by the owner into one property tax parcel.
b. The substandard lot or parcel has never been developed
with one or more of its structures placed partly upon an adjacent
lot or parcel.
c. The substandard lot or parcel is developed to comply with
all other ordinance requirements.
4. Planned unit development. A non-riparian lot may be
created which does not meet the requirements of subd. 1. if the
county has approved and recorded a plat or certified survey map
including that lot within a planned unit development, if the
planned unit development contains at least 2 acres or 200 feet of
frontage, and if the reduced non-riparian lot sizes are allowed in
exchange for larger shoreland buffers and setbacks on those lots
adjacent to navigable waters that are proportional to and offset the
impacts of the reduced lots on habitat, water quality and natural
scenic beauty.
(b) Building setbacks. Permitted building setbacks shall be
established to conform to health, safety and welfare requirements,
preserve natural beauty, reduce flood hazards and avoid water
pollution.
1. Shoreland setback. Except where exempt under subd.
1m., a setback of 75 feet from the ordinary high-water mark of any
navigable waters to the nearest part of a building or structure shall
be required for all buildings and structures. Where an existing
development pattern exists, the shoreland setback for a proposed
principal structure may be reduced to the average shoreland setback
of the principal structure on each adjacent lot, but the shoreland
setback may not be reduced to less than 35 feet from the ordinary
high-water mark of any navigable waters.
Note: A property owner may seek a variance to a dimensional standard of the
county ordinance and a county board of adjustment may review the request pursuant
to s. 59.694 (7) (c), Stats.
1m. Exempt structures. All of the following structures are
exempt from the shoreland setback standards in subd. 1.:
a. Boathouses located entirely above the ordinary high-water
mark and entirely within the access and viewing corridor that do
not contain plumbing and are not used for human habitation.
Note: This chapter does not prohibit repair and maintenance of boathouses located
above the ordinary high-water mark.
b. Open sided and screened structures such as gazebos, decks,
patios and screen houses in the shoreland setback area that satisfy
the requirements in s. 59.692 (1v), Stats.
c. Fishing rafts that are authorized on the Wolf river and Mississippi
river under s. 30.126, Stats.
d. Broadcast signal receivers, including satellite dishes or
antennas that are one meter or less in diameter and satellite earth
station antennas that are 2 meters or less in diameter.
e. Utility transmission and distribution lines, poles, towers,
water towers, pumping stations, well pumphouse covers, private
on-site wastewater treatment systems that comply with ch. SPS
383, and other utility structures that have no feasible alternative
location outside of the minimum setback and that employ best
management practices to infiltrate or otherwise control storm
water runoff from the structure.
f. Walkways, stairways or rail systems that are necessary to
provide pedestrian access to the shoreline and are a maximum of
60-inches in width.
2. Floodplain structures. Buildings and structures to be constructed
or placed in a flood plain shall be required to comply with
any applicable flood plain zoning ordinance.
3. Boathouses. The use of boathouses for human habitation
and the construction or placing of boathouses beyond the ordinary
high-water mark of any navigable waters shall be prohibited.
(c) Vegetation. To protect natural scenic beauty, fish and wildlife
habitat, and water quality, a county shall regulate removal of
vegetation in shoreland areas, consistent with the following:
1. The county shall establish ordinance standards that consider
sound forestry and soil conservation practices and the effect
of vegetation removal on water quality, including soil erosion, and
the flow of effluents, sediments and nutrients.
Note: In developing and applying ordinances which apply to shoreland areas,
local units of government must consider other applicable law and programs affecting
the lands to be regulated, e.g., law and management practices that apply to state and
county forests and lands entered under forest cropland and managed forest land programs,
and ss. 59.692 (2) (a) and 59.69 (4) (a), Stats.
2. To protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat and natural
scenic beauty, and to promote preservation and restoration of
native vegetation, the county ordinance shall designate land that
extends from the ordinary high water mark to a minimum of 35
feet inland as a vegetative buffer zone and prohibit removal of
vegetation in the vegetative buffer zone except as follows:
a. The county may allow routine maintenance of vegetation.
b. The county may allow removal of trees and shrubs in the
vegetative buffer zone to create access and viewing corridors, provided
that the combined width of all access and viewing corridors
on a riparian lot or parcel may not exceed the lesser of 30 percent
of the shoreline frontage or 200 feet.
c. The county may allow removal of trees and shrubs in the
vegetative buffer zone on a parcel with 10 or more acres of forested
land consistent with generally accepted forestry management
practices as defined in s. NR 1.25 (2) (b), and described in
Department publication Wisconsin Forest Management Guidelines
(publication FR-226), provided that vegetation removal be
consistent with these practices.
d. The county may allow removal of vegetation within the
vegetative buffer zone to manage exotic or invasive species, damaged
vegetation, vegetation that must be removed to control disease,
or vegetation creating an imminent safety hazard, provided
that any vegetation removed be replaced by replanting in the same
area as soon as practicable.
Note: Information regarding native plants, shoreland and habitat management is
available from the University of Wisconsin-Extension publications website:
http://clean-water.uwex.edu/pubs/index.htm.
e. The county may authorize by permit additional vegetation
management activities in the vegetative buffer zone. The permit
issued under this subd. par. shall require that all management
activities comply with detailed plans approved by the county and
designed to control erosion by limiting sedimentation into the

waterbody, to improve the plant community by replanting in the
same area, and to maintain and monitor the newly restored area.
The permit also shall require an enforceable restriction to preserve
the newly restored area.
(d) Filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching and excavating.
Filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching and excavating
may be permitted only in accordance with the provisions
of s. NR 115.04, the requirements of ch. 30, Stats., and other state
and federal laws where applicable, and only if done in a manner
designed to minimize erosion, sedimentation and impairment of
fish and wildlife habitat and natural scenic beauty.
(e) Impervious surfaces. Counties shall establish impervious
surface standards to protect water quality and fish and wildlife
habitat and protect against pollution of navigable waters. County
impervious surface standards shall require all of the following:
1. Application. Impervious surface standards shall apply to
the construction, reconstruction, expansion, replacement or
relocation of any impervious surface that is or will be located
within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of any navigable
waterway on any of the following:
a. A riparian lot or parcel.
b. A nonriparian lot or parcel that is located entirely within
300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable waterway
1m. Calculation. Percentage of impervious surface shall be
calculated by dividing the surface area of the existing and proposed
impervious surfaces on the lot or parcel by the total surface
area of that lot or parcel, and multiplying by 100. For the purposes
of this subdivision counties may exclude impervious surfaces
described in subd. 3m. If an outlot lies between the ordinary high
water mark and the developable lot or parcel described in subd. 1.
and both are in common ownership, the lot or parcel and the outlot
shall be considered one lot or parcel for the purposes of calculating
the percentage of impervious surfaces.
2. General standard. Except as allowed in subds. 2m. to 4.,
a county may allow up to 15% impervious surface as calculated
under subd. 1m on a lot or parcel described in subd. 1.
2m. Standard for highly developed shorelines. At its discretion,
a county may adopt an ordinance for highly developed
shorelines that allows impervious surface as calculated under
subd. 1m on lots or parcels described in subd. 1 as follows: up to
30% for residential land uses or up to 40% for commercial, industrial
or business land uses.
a. A highly developed shoreline means a shoreline within
an area identified as an Urbanized Area or Urban Cluster in the
2010 US Census or a shoreline that has a commercial, industrial
or business land use as of January 31, 2013.
b. A county may establish, after conducting a hearing and
receiving approval by the department, a map of additional areas
of highly developed shorelines not included in subd. 2m. a.
c. An additional area of highly developed shoreline under
subd. 2m. b., shall include at least 500 feet of shoreline and as of
February 1, 2010, have either a majority of its lots developed with
more than 30% impervious surface area as calculated under subd.
1m. or be located on a lake and served by a sewerage system as
defined in s. NR 110.03 (30). To obtain approval from the department
for an additional area, the county shall provide data to the
department that establishes that the additional area meets the criteria
under this subd. 2m. c.
3. Maximum impervious surface. A county may allow a
property owner to exceed the impervious surface standard under
subds. 2. and 2m. provided that all of the following requirements
are met:
a. For lots or parcels described under subd. 1. that exceed the
impervious surface standard under subd. 2. and are not located
within a highly developed shoreline as defined in subd. 2m., a
county may allow more than 15% impervious surface but not
more than 30% impervious surface as calculated under subd. 1m
on the lot or parcel.
b. For lots or parcels described under subd. 1. and located
within an area defined by county ordinance as a highly developed
shoreline under subd. 2m., a county may allow more than 30%
impervious surface but not more than 40% impervious surface as
calculated under subd. 1m on the lot or parcel for properties that
have a residential land use, or more than 40% impervious surface
but not more than 60% impervious surface as calculated under
subd. 1m. for properties that have a commercial, industrial or
business land use.
c. For lots or parcels described under subd. 1 that exceed the
impervious surface standard under subds. 2. and 2m., but do not
exceed the maximum impervious surface standard under subd. 3.
a. or b., the county shall issue a permit that requires a mitigation
plan approved by the county and implemented by the property
owner by the date specified in the permit. The mitigation plan
shall include enforceable obligations of the property owner to
establish or maintain measures that the county determines adequate
to offset the impacts of the impervious surface on water
quality, near-shore aquatic habitat, upland wildlife habitat and
natural scenic beauty. The mitigation measures shall be proportional
to the amount and impacts of the impervious surface being
permitted. The obligations of the property owner under the mitigation
plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded in the
office of the county register of deeds.
3m. Treated impervious surfaces. A county may exclude
from the calculation under subdivision 1m., any impervious surface
where the property owner can show that runoff from the
impervious surface is treated by devices such as stormwater
ponds, constructed wetlands, infiltration basins, rain gardens, bioswales
or other engineered systems, or that the runoff discharges
to internally drained pervious area that retains the runoff on the
parcel to allow infiltration into the soil.
Note: A property owner may seek a variance to a dimensional standard of the
county ordinance, for areas that exceed the maximum impervious surface standard
in subd. 3. and do not meet the provisions in subd. 3m. A county board of adjustment
must review the request pursuant to s. 59.694 (7) (c), Stats., and applicable case law.
Note: Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to supersede the setback provisions
in par. (b). New structures must meet all setback provisions in the county shoreland
ordinance unless the property owner obtains a variance from the County Board
of Adjustment.
4. Existing impervious surfaces. For existing impervious
surfaces that were lawfully placed when constructed but that do
not comply with the standards in subds. 2. and 3., the property
owner may do any of the following as long as the property owner
does not increase the percentage of impervious surface that
existed on the effective date of the county shoreland ordinance:
a. Maintain and repair all impervious surfaces.
b. Replace existing impervious surfaces with similar surfaces
within the existing building envelope.
c. Relocate or modify existing impervious surfaces with similar
or different impervious surfaces, provided that the relocation
or modification meets the applicable setback requirements in par.
(b).
Note: For example this provision would allow an existing at-grade patio to be
removed and replaced with a new building, if the new building meets the shoreland
setback requirements.
Note: Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to supersede other provisions
in county shoreland ordinances.
(f) Height. To protect and preserve wildlife habitat and natural
scenic beauty, on or after February 1, 2010, a county may not permit
any construction that results in a structure taller than 35 feet
within 75 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable
waters.
(g) Nonconforming structures and uses. 1. General rule for
nonconforming uses. Pursuant to ss. 59.69 (10) and 59.692 (2)
(a), Stats., an ordinance enacted under those provisions may not
prohibit the continuation of the lawful use of a building, structure
or property, that exists when an ordinance or ordinance amend-

use is discontinued for a period of 12 months, any future use of the
building, structure or property shall conform to the ordinance.
4. Maintenance of nonconforming principal structure. An
existing principal structure that was lawfully placed when constructed
but that does not comply with the required building setback
under par. (b) 1. may be maintained and repaired within its
existing building envelope. Maintenance and repair also includes
such activities as interior remodeling, exterior remodeling, and
the replacement or enhancement of plumbing or electrical systems,
insulation, windows, doors, siding, or roof within the existing
building envelope.
5. Expansion of nonconforming principal structure within
the setback. An existing principal structure that was lawfully
placed when constructed but that does not comply with the
required building setback under par. (b) 1. may be expanded laterally
or vertically, provided that all of the following requirements
are met:
a. The use of the structure has not been discontinued for a
period of 12 months or more if a nonconforming use.
b. The existing principal structure is at least 35 feet from the
ordinary high-water mark.
c. Vertical expansion is limited to the height allowed in s. NR
115.05 (1) (f) and lateral expansions are limited to a maximum of
200 square feet over the life of the structure. No portion of the
expansion may be any closer to the ordinary high-water mark
than the closest point of the existing principal structure.
d. The county shall issue a permit that requires a mitigation
plan that shall be approved by the county and implemented by the
property owner by the date specified in the permit. The mitigation
plan shall include enforceable obligations of the property owner
to establish or maintain measures that the county determines adequate
to offset the impacts of the permitted expansion on water
quality, near-shore aquatic habitat, upland wildlife habitat and
natural scenic beauty. The mitigation measures shall be proportional
to the amount and impacts of the expansion being permitted.
The obligations of the property owner under the mitigation
plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded in the
office of the county register of deeds.
e. All other provisions of the shoreland ordinance shall be
met.
Note: Other provisions include requirements such as impervious surface limitations.

5m. Expansion of nonconforming principal structure
beyond setback. An existing principal structure that was lawfully
placed when constructed but that does not comply with the
required building setback under par. (b) 1., may be expanded horizontally,
landward or vertically provided that the expanded area
meets the building setback requirements in par. (b) 1., and that all
other provisions of the shoreland ordinance are met. A mitigation
plan is not required solely for expansion under this paragraph, but
may be required under par. (e) 3.
6. Replacement or relocation of nonconforming principal
structure. An existing principal structure that was lawfully
placed when constructed but that does not comply with the
required building setback under par. (b) 1. may be replaced or
relocated on the property provided all of the following requirements
are met:
a. The use of the structure has not been discontinued for a
period of 12 months or more if a nonconforming use.
b. The existing principal structure is at least 35 feet from the
ordinary high-water mark.
c. No portion of the replaced or relocated structure is located
any closer to the ordinary high-water mark than the closest point
of the existing principal structure.
d. The county determines that no other location is available
on the property to build a principal structure of a comparable size
to the structure proposed for replacement or relocation that will
result in compliance with the shoreland setback requirement in
par. (b) 1.
e. The county shall issue a permit that requires a mitigation
plan that shall be approved by the county and implemented by the
property owner by the date specified in the permit. The mitigation
plan shall include enforceable obligations of the property owner
to establish or maintain measures that the county determines are
adequate to offset the impacts of the permitted expansion on water
quality, near-shore aquatic habitat, upland wildlife habitat and
natural scenic beauty. The mitigation measures shall be proportional
to the amount and impacts of the replaced or relocated structure
being permitted. The obligations of the property owner under
the mitigation plan shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded
in the office of the county register of deeds.
g. All other provisions of the shoreland ordinance shall be
met.
Note: Other provisions include requirements such as height and impervious surface
limitations.
Note: This code does not supercede s. 59.692 (1s), Stats.
Note: Effective April 17, 2012, 2011 Wisconsin Act 170 created s. 59.692 (2m),
Stats., which prohibits a county from enacting, and a county, city, or village from
enforcing, any provision in a county shoreland or subdivision ordinance that regulates
the location, maintenance, expansion, replacement, repair, or relocation of a
nonconforming building if the provision is more restrictive than the standards for
nonconforming buildings under ch. NR 115.
(2) ESTABLISHMENT OF LAND DIVISION REVIEW. Each county
shall review, pursuant to s. 236.45, Stats., all land divisions in
shoreland areas which create 3 or more parcels or building sites
of 5 acres each or less within a 5-year period. In such review all
of the following factors shall be considered:
(a) Hazards to the health, safety or welfare of future residents.
(b) Proper relationship to adjoining areas.
(c) Public access to navigable waters, as required by law.
(d) Adequate storm drainage facilities.
(e) Conformity to state law and administrative code provisions.
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF SANITARY REGULATIONS. Each county
shall adopt sanitary regulations for the protection of health and the
preservation and enhancement of water quality.
(a) Where public water supply systems are not available, private
well construction shall be required to conform to ch. NR 812.
(b) Where a public sewage collection and treatment system is
not available, design and construction of private sewage disposal
systems shall, prior to July 1, 1980, be required to comply with ch.

(e) A variance procedure which authorizes the board of adjustment
to grant such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will
not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions
and the adoption of the shoreland zoning ordinance, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in
unnecessary hardship, as long as the granting of a variance does
not have the effect of granting or increasing any use of property
which is prohibited in that zoning district by the shoreland zoning
ordinance.

NR 115.06 Department duties. (1) ASSISTANCE TO
COUNTIES. To the full extent of its available resources, the department
shall provide advice and assistance to counties in the development,
adoption, administration and enforcement of their shoreland
zoning and land division ordinances, seeking the highest
practicable degree of uniformity consistent with the shoreland
protection objectives found in s. 281.31, Stats. As a part of this
effort, the department shall prepare a model shoreland zoning
ordinance which counties may use in meeting the requirements of
s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter.
(2) REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF SHORELAND ZONING AND LAND
DIVISION ORDINANCES. When determining whether a shoreland
zoning or subdivision ordinance or any subsequent amendment
enacted by a county complies with s. 59.692, Stats., the department
shall compare the ordinance and amendments with the minimum
standards and requirements for shoreland regulation in this
chapter.
(a) Initial ordinance. The department shall issue a certificate
of compliance when a county has, in the opinion of the department,
complied with s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter.
(b) Amendments to ordinance. The department and each
county shall assure that the county shoreland ordinance continues
to comply with this chapter by doing the following:
1. County duties. A county shall keep its shoreland zoning
and subdivision ordinances in compliance with s. 59.692, Stats.,
and this chapter by doing all of the following:
a. A county shall amend its shoreland and subdivision ordinances
to meet the minimum standards in this chapter within two
years after October 1, 2014.
Note: On September 12, 2010, the Secretary of the Department of Natural
Resources signed an executive order extending the date by which a county must adopt
or amend shoreland and subdivision ordinances to meet the revised standards in ch.
NR 115. The date was extended to February 1, 2014.
b. Pursuant to s. NR 115.05 (4) (h) and (hm), a county shall
provide the department notice of hearing on any proposed ordinance
amendment and a copy of any decision denying or enacting
an amendment.
2. Department duties. a. The department may periodically
reevaluate county shoreland zoning and subdivision ordinances
for continuing compliance with s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter.
b. The department shall review any ordinance amendment
enacted pursuant to subd. 1. a. and shall issue a certificate of compliance
when the amended ordinance, in the opinion of the department,
complies with s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter.
(c) Proposed amendments to shoreland-wetland districts. The
department shall review all proposed amendments to shoreland-
wetland zoning districts pursuant to s. NR 115.04 (2) to determine
whether an ordinance which is amended as proposed will comply
with s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter.
(3) DETERMINATION OF NONCOMPLIANCE. (a) Failure to enact
initial ordinance or amendments. A county that does not have a
shoreland zoning ordinance and subdivision ordinance in effect or
that fails to amend its ordinance as required by sub. (2) (b) 1. shall
be deemed to be in noncompliance with s. 59.692, Stats., and this
chapter. Pursuant to s. 59.692 (6), Stats., and after notice and hearing,
the department shall adopt an ordinance if a county fails to do
one of the following:
1. Draft and enact shoreland and subdivision ordinances or
required amendments within a time period specified by the department.
2. Contract with a consultant to draft the shoreland and subdivision
ordinances or required amendments and enact the ordinances
within a time period specified by the department.
3. Cooperate with department staff to draft shoreland and subdivision
ordinances or required amendments to be enacted by the
county within a time period specified by the department not to
exceed 180 days.
(b) Failure to meet minimum standards in initial ordinance or
amendments. Counties which have shoreland zoning and subdivision
ordinances or amendments that the department has reviewed
under sub. (2) and found do not meet the minimum standards in
this chapter shall be deemed to be in noncompliance with the
requirements of s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter, and the procedures
in par. (a) shall apply. If a county fails to modify its ordinance
to meet the minimum standards within 6 months after
receipt of final amended Wisconsin wetland inventory maps for
that county as required by s. NR 115.04 (2) (b), the department
shall adopt an ordinance for the county, after notice and hearing,
pursuant to s. 59.692 (6), Stats.
(c) Extension of time. The department may extend the time
periods specified in pars. (a) and (b) if it determines an extension
is in the public interest.
(d) Costs. Pursuant to ss. 59.692 (6) and 87.30 (1) (c), Stats.,
the costs of any actions by the department under this subsection
to adopt an ordinance or amendments shall be assessed against the
county concerned and collected in substantially the same manner
as other taxes levied by the state.
(4) MONITORING. It is the responsibility of the department, to
aid in the fulfillment of the states role as trustee of its navigable
waters, to monitor the administration and enforcement of shore-

Note: Chapter NR 116 as it existed on February 28, 1986 was repealed and a new
chapter NR 116 was created effective March 1, 1986.
NR 116.01 Purpose. (1) The Wisconsin legislature in
enacting chapter 614, laws of 1965, recognized that floodplain
zoning is a necessary tool to protect human life, health and to
minimize property damages and economic losses. Municipalities
are required by s. 87.30 (1), Stats., to adopt reasonable and effective
floodplain zoning ordinances within their respective jurisdictions
to regulate all floodplains where serious flood damage may
occur within one year after hydraulic and engineering data adequate
to formulate the ordinance becomes available. If a municipality
has a floodplain zoning ordinance already in effect, the provisions
in s. NR 116.05 shall apply.
(2) The purpose of these rules is to provide a uniform basis for
the preparation and implementation of sound floodplain regulations
for all Wisconsin municipalities, to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood
control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts, generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public;
(d) Minimize business interruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities such as water mains,
sewer lines, streets and bridges;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas;
(g) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home
buyers; and
(h) Prevent increases in the regional flood from occurring
which will increase flood damage and may result in conflict and
litigation between landowners.
History: Cr. Register, February, 1986, No. 362, eff. 3-1-86.
NR 116.02 Applicability. The provisions of this chapter
are applicable to all municipalities. Unless otherwise specifically
exempted by law, all state agencies are required to obtain permits
required by local zoning ordinances if s. 13.48 (13), Stats.,
applies.
Note: Corps of engineers dredged material disposal activities which are authorized
pursuant to s. 30.202 (2), Stats., are exempt from the requirements of this chapter.

of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin or
which may be expected to occur on a particular lake, river or
stream once in every 100 years.
Note: The regional flood is based upon a statistical analysis of lake level or streamflow
records available for the watershed or an analysis of rainfall and runoff characteristics
in the watershed or both. The flood frequency of the regional flood is once
in every 100 years. In any given year, there is a 1% chance that the regional flood may
occur or be exceeded. During a typical 30-year mortgage period, the regional flood

areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily
burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.
(49) Variance means an authorization by the board of
adjustment or appeals under s. NR 116.21 (4), for the construction
or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is
inconsistent with dimensional standards contained in the floodplain
zoning ordinance.
Note: A variance can only be granted by the board of adjustment or appeals. A
variance may not permit a use of property otherwise prohibited by the floodplain zoning
ordinance or allow construction not protected to the flood protection elevation;
it may, however, permit deviations from dimensional standards.
(50) Watershed means the entire region or area contributing
runoff or surface water to a particular watercourse or body of
water.
(51) Water surface profile means a graphical representation

(3) HYDROLOGIC ANALYSIS  DETERMINATION OF REGIONAL
FLOOD DISCHARGE. (a) Techniques. Studies to determine the
regional flood flow discharge may use the following techniques,
if done in accordance with the requirements of par. (b):
1. The log-Pearson Type III distribution method as described
in Bulletin #17B of the Hydrology Committee, U.S. Water
Resources Council, entitled Guidelines For Determining Flood
Flow Frequency, September, 1981.
2. The current USGS empirical equations, developed from
regression analysis of stream gaging data. (See USGS publication
entitled Technique for Estimating Magnitude and Frequency of
Floods in Wisconsin, by Conger, March, 1981.)
3. Synthetic hydrographs, which are combined and routed
through the basin to the downstream end of the study area.
4. When using the synthetic hydrograph technique in subd.
3., the results shall be calibrated to past events where such information
is available.
5. Technical Release No. 55 (TR55), entitled Urban Hydrology
For Small Watersheds, Engineering Division, SCS,
U.S.D.A., January, 1975.
6. Comparison of similar drainage basins at gaged sites.
7. Historic flood data.
8. Other methods with department approval.
(b) Required use of techniques. The following shall be the
minimum standards for determining the regional flood flow discharge:
1. The techniques to determine skew under par. (a) 1. may not
be used if data from a gaging station in the watershed is not available
or is available for a period of less than 10 years. In other
cases, the technique to determine skew in par. (a) 1. shall be modified
as follows:
a. If data from a gaging station in the watershed is available
for 10 or more years but less than 26 years, the station skew shall
be weighted with zero skew in accordance with Bulletin #17B.
b. If data from a gaging station in the watershed is available
for 26 or more years, the station skew shall be used.
c. Skew values differing from those obtained in subd. 1. a. or
b. may be used if they are approved by the department.
2. If the difference in the drainage area at the study site and
the drainage area at a gaging station on the same watershed is less
than or equal to 50%, the regional flood discharge at the study site
shall be determined by transferring the calculated regional flood
discharge at the gage by using Bulletin #17B techniques to the
study site using a drainage area ratio taken to the n power, from
page 12 of Techniques for Estimating Magnitude and Frequency
of Floods for Wisconsin Streams, U.S.G.S., Open File Report
80-1214, March 1981.
3. If the difference in the drainage area at the study site and
the drainage area at a gaging station in the watershed is more than
50%, or if there is no gaging station in the watershed, at least 2 of
the techniques described in par. (a) 2. to 7. shall be used to determine
a weighted value of the regional flood discharge.
4. Comparison of similar drainage basins under par. (a) 5.
shall be based on basin characteristics using Bulletin #17B
100-year discharges.
5. When using USGS empirical equations under par. (a) 2.,
the results shall be compared with Bulletin #17B 100-year discharges
at gaged sites on similar drainage basins.
6. In all cases where dams or reservoirs, floodplain development
or land use upstream have significantly altered the storage
capacity or runoff characteristics of the watershed so as to affect
the validity of any of the techniques listed in par. (a), the synthetic
hydrograph technique in par. (a) 3. or the Technical Release No.
55 in par. (a) 4. shall be used for the determination of the regional
flood flow discharge.
7. In rapidly urbanizing watersheds, the municipality shall
require that computations for regional flood flow discharges
reflect increased runoff from all projected future development.
These computations shall be made using one of the following
techniques:
a. A synthetic hydrograph based upon projected watershed
development shall be produced and routed to critical locations
within the study limits.
b. A mathematical model shall be developed to determine the
effects of all projected future development in the watershed on the
regional flood flow discharge. Local units of government shall
project what percentage of watershed development may occur
under existing land use or subdivision ordinances and regional
flood discharges shall be based upon that data. Where there are
no existing land use or subdivision ordinances which control or
regulate future development, total projected development shall be
assumed to occupy 70% of the watershed. Where watersheds contain
more than one municipality, agreements between those
municipalities may be necessary to restrict future watershed development.
In order to insure that future regional flood flows do not
exceed the regional flood flow discharges used in local regulations,
changes in existing land use or subdivision ordinances
which may allow an increase or decrease in the projected development
in the watershed shall be reflected in regional flood flow discharge
values.
(4) HYDRAULIC ANALYSIS  DETERMINATION OF THE REGIONAL
FLOOD ELEVATION. The following criteria shall be the basis for
determining the regional flood profile:
(a) Reconnaissance. The study contractor is responsible for
the collection of all existing data with regard to flooding in the
study area. This shall include a literature search of all published
reports in the study area and adjacent communities and an information
search to obtain all unpublished information on flooding
in the immediate and adjacent areas from federal, state and local
units of government. This information shall include specific
information on past flooding in the area, drainage structures such
as bridges and culverts that affect flooding in the area, available
topographic maps, available community maps, photos of past
flood events and general flooding problems within the community.
The study contractor will coordinate the collection of all available
data and published reports with the department. A field
reconnaissance shall be made by the responsible engineer to
determine hydraulic conditions of the study area including type
and number of structures, locations of cross sections and other
parameters including roughness values which are necessary for
the hydraulic analysis.
(b) Base data. Cross sections to be used for the hydraulic analysis
may be obtained by one of several methods, including surveying
or aerial photography. New or previously surveyed cross sections
or topographic information obtained from aerial
photographs may be used independently or in combination as the
base data to be used in hydraulic analysis. The elevation datum
of all of the information to be used in the hydraulic model shall be
verified. All information used shall be referenced directly to
NGVD unless the elevation datum is otherwise approved by the
department.
(c) Methodology. Flood profiles shall be calculated by the
standard step method, using the Corps of Engineers HEC-2 computer
model. Other methods may be used with prior department
approval provided that any computer models submitted to the
department for review are in a form acceptable for entry into the
departments floodplain data repository.
(d) Floodway determination. The hydraulic floodway lines
shall be determined from the limits of effective flow based on the
calculated regional flood water surface profile. Transitions shall
take into account obstructions to flow such as road approach
grades, bridges or natural restrictions. General guidelines for
transitions may be found in HEC-2, Water Surface Profiles-Us-

ers Manual, appendix IV, Application of HEC-2 Bridge Routine
published by the Hydrologic Engineering Center, Davis, California.
All areas of the floodplain including overbank areas that can
be assumed to convey flood waters shall be included in the
hydraulic floodway.
(e) Previous floodplain studies. If differences exist between
a study previously approved by the department and the contractors
calculated hydraulic floodways or flood profiles, the study
contractor shall document justification and obtain departmental
approval for these differences. Where the contractors study differs
from existing flood profiles or hydraulic floodways for adjacent
communities, verification of the differences will be necessary
for department approval of the hydraulic analysis.
(f) Calculation of the regional flood profile. The regional
flood profile and changes to that profile caused by development
in the floodplain, as determined by the hydraulic model, shall be
calculated to the nearest 0.01 foot.
(g) Adequacy of the hydraulic model. The following factors
shall be considered by the department to determine the adequacy
of the hydraulic model and the regional flood profile. Upon written
request by the department the study contractor shall submit
written justification for the following factors:
1. Cross section spacing.
2. Differences in energy grade.
Note: Significant differences in the energy grade from cross section to cross section
are an indication that cross sections should be more closely spaced or that other
inaccuracies exist in the hydraulic model.
3. Methods for analyzing the hydraulics of structures such as
bridges and culverts.
4. Lack of flow continuity.
5. Use of gradually varied flow model.
Note: In certain circumstances, rapidly varied flow techniques shall be used in
combination with a gradually varied flow model such as weir flow over a levee or
dike, flow through the spillway of a dam or special applications of bridge flow.
6. Mannings n values.
7. Calibration of the hydraulic model with past flood events.
(h) Special applications. The methods defined in par. (c) shall
be used except in special cases, including circumstances where
sediment transport, 2 dimensional flow or valley storage affects
the accuracy of the hydraulic model. Where the standard step
method is unwarranted, the department shall approve the method
used for establishing the final water surface profile.
(i) Base mapping. In the preparation of a floodplain zoning
map to be used by the municipality, the study contractor shall use
the best available mapping to delineate floodplain limits.
(j) Final report. A narrative report shall accompany the maps
and profiles and shall include the following:
1. Purpose of the study and description of the study area.
2. Coordination with other agencies.
3. Data collection.
4. Past flooding.
5. Engineering methods including a detailed description of
the methodology used for hydrology, hydraulics and any special
applications used in this study.
6. A floodway data table showing cross sections, drainage
area, distance between cross sections, floodway top width, discharge,
cross sectional area, mean velocity and regional flood
elevation.
7. Previous studies on the same watercourse.
8. An appendix which includes:
a. Drainage basin maps.
b. Precipitation maps.
c. Pertinent photographs.
d. Soil and vegetation maps.
e. Sample calculations of the hydrologic analyses including
all unit hydrographs.
f. Stream flow records.
g. Channel roughness values.
h. Any other data required by the department.
(k) Wave action on the Great Lakes. Standards used to determine
the regional flood elevation for all municipalities adjacent
to the Great Lakes shall be those specified in the publication,

NR 116.09 Data required to be shown on floodplain
zoning maps. Municipalities shall delineate the entire floodplain
on their floodplain zoning maps.
(1) If the regional flood profile has been determined, the profile
shall be used to develop the floodplain zoning maps which the
municipality shall use as the basis for floodplain zoning.
(a) The maps shall show the following:
1. The floodway district;
2. The floodfringe district;
3. The regional flood elevation consistent with the regional
flood profile shall be clearly lettered at identifiable positions on
the official floodplain zoning maps. If for any reason that elevation
is not shown on the maps, the profile shall be attached to and
made a part of the maps; and
4. Source and date of study.
(b) In addition to the information in par. (a), the floodplain zoning
maps shall include the following information, where applicable:
1. The shallow depth flooding district.
2. The flood storage district.
3. The coastal floodplain district.
4. Floodplain islands.
5. For developed and undeveloped areas downstream of
dams, the floodway and floodfringe districts based on 3 conditions:
a. Assuming the dam is in place,
b. Assuming the dam is not in place, and
c. Assuming failure of the dam during the regional flood.
6. For areas adjacent to levees, floodwalls and channel
improvements, the floodway and floodfringe districts based on 2
conditions:
a. Assuming the levee, floodwall or channel improvement is
not in place, and
b. Assuming the levee, floodwall or channel improvement is
in place.
(c) If technical information is available to ascertain the magnitude
of floods larger than the regional flood the floodplain limits
of these large floods may be reflected on the official floodplain
zoning maps and used for either public information purposes or
for regulation.
(2) If the regional flood profile has not been determined, maps
based upon historical floods, flood prone area maps, flood hazard
boundary maps, aerial photos or detailed soils maps may initially
serve as a basis for floodplain delineation, provided that the associated
text of the zoning ordinance provides for a procedure similar
to ss. NR 116.20 (2) and 116.21 (3) to ascertain the effects of
all development upon flood flows and the regional flood elevation.
History: Cr. Register, February, 1986, No. 362, eff. 3-1-86.
NR 116.10 Conflicts between water surface profiles
and floodplain zoning maps. Accepted engineering principles
and techniques shall govern the transfer of profile elevation
for use in delineation of the floodplain limits on the official floodplain
zoning maps. If a conflict exists between the floodplain limits
illustrated on the maps and the actual field conditions, the
elevations from the water surface profile shall be the governing
factor in locating the official floodplain limits.
History: Cr. Register, February, 1986, No. 362, eff. 3-1-86.
NR 116.11 Criteria for establishing and rezoning
floodplain districts. (1) DELINEATION OF FLOODWAY, FLOODFRINGE
AND COASTAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS. Except as provided
in sub. (2), the following criteria shall apply to the delineation of
floodway, floodfringe and coastal floodplain districts.
(a) Floodway district. The official floodway lines shown on
floodplain zoning maps shall be the hydraulic floodway lines.
These hydraulic floodway lines shall be determined by studies
complying with the standards contained in s. NR 116.07.
(b) Floodfringe district. All areas within the floodplain landward
of the official floodway lines shall be shown as a floodfringe
district.
(c) Coastal floodplain district. All areas adjacent to Lake
Superior or Lake Michigan within the regional floodplain shall be
designated as a coastal floodplain district.
(2) REDELINEATION OR REZONING FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS. In
accordance with the criteria of sub. (3), the following redelineations
or rezonings may occur:
(a) Redelineation or rezoning the floodway district to floodfringe
district. Riverward delineations of the official floodway
lines established in accordance with sub. (1) (a) are permissible
provided the following criteria are satisfied:
1. Any increase in regional flood height due to the delineation
of the official floodway lines riverward from the hydraulic floodway
lines shall be approved by the department prior to becoming
effective. Increases may only be approved by the department if
the provisions of sub. (3) are satisfied.
2. The effects of delineating the official floodway lines riverward
from the hydraulic floodway lines shall be calculated by
comparing the regional flood profile determined from the hydrau-

lic floodway lines to that profile determined by assuming that the
area landward of the revised floodway lines is not available to convey
flood flows. Calculations shall conform to the standards contained
in s. NR 116.07.
(b) Redelineation or rezoning floodfringe district to floodway
district. Landward modifications of hydraulic floodway lines to
delineate official floodway lines may be permitted provided the
following conditions are satisfied:
1. The redelineation of the floodway lines is consistent with
other municipal codes, ordinances, and ch. 30, Stats.; and
2. The current hydraulic floodway lines, which reflect the
water surface profile used for regulation, shall be kept on file by
the municipality.
(c) Redelineation or rezoning floodway district to shallow
depth flooding district. For areas subject to shallow depth flooding,
the official floodway lines may be delineated riverward of the
hydraulic floodway lines, provided all of the criteria in this paragraph
are satisfied:
1. The maximum depth of flooding during the regional flood
in the shallow depth flooding district may not exceed one foot in
depth nor 6 hours in duration. The duration shall be determined
by a synthetic hydrograph developed for the watershed and routed
through the area;
2. The area is developed complete with existing streets and
sewers and is subject to a land use plan, which includes provisions
for drainage ways through the area with the capacity to convey
that percentage of the regional flood which is flowing through the
area under existing conditions;
3. The municipality shall adopt standards outlined in s. NR
116.14 (1) pertaining to shallow depth flooding district;
4. All areas within the hydraulic floodway landward of the
official floodway lines shall be designated as shallow depth
flooding district; and
5. All areas within the floodplain landward of the hydraulic
floodway lines shall be delineated as floodfringe district.
(d) Redelineation or rezoning floodfringe district to flood storage
district. A flood storage district may be established for the
area landward of the floodway in lieu of the floodfringe designation
where floodplain storage will decrease the calculation of discharge
and therefore the regional flood elevation, provided the
following criteria are met:
1. The department shall approve the methodology used to
analyze floodplain storage to determine revised regional flood
elevations.
2. The municipality shall adopt standards outlined in s. NR
116.14 (2) pertaining to the flood storage district.
(e) Rezoning flood storage district to floodfringe district. Any
proposal to rezone flood storage district to floodfringe district
shall comply with the following conditions:
1. Any increase in regional flood height shall be approved by
the department prior to becoming effective. Increases in the
regional flood elevation may only be approved by the department
if the provisions in sub. (3) are satisfied; and
2. The effect of rezoning the flood storage district to the floodfringe
district shall be calculated by comparing the regional flood
profile used as the basis for zoning to the regional flood profile
determined by assuming that the area to be rezoned is not available
to store floodwater.
(f) Rezoning the shallow depth flooding district to floodfringe
district. Any proposal to rezone the shallow depth flooding district
to floodfringe district shall comply with the following conditions:
1. Any increase in regional flood height shall be approved by
the department prior to the rezoning becoming effective.
Increases in the regional flood elevation may only be approved by
the department if the provisions in sub. (3) are satisfied;
2. The entire shallow depth flooding district shall be rezoned
to floodfringe district; and
3. The effect of rezoning the shallow depth flooding district
to the floodfringe district shall be calculated by comparing the
regional flood profile determined by the hydraulic floodway lines
to the regional flood profile determined by assuming that the
entire shallow depth flooding district is not available to convey
floodflows. Calculations shall conform to the standards contained
in s. NR 116.07.
(3) CRITERIA FOR REDELINEATION OR REZONING FLOODPLAIN
DISTRICTS. (a) Initial determinations. Prior to redelineation or
rezoning any floodplain district a municipality shall:
1. Assure that the applicable provisions of sub. (2) are met;
2. Require adequate technical data from the applicant or the
municipality and submit such data to the department for review
and concurrence in the effect of the proposed amendment on the
height of the regional flood;
3. Assure that the proposed amendments meet the purpose of
s. NR 116.01;
4. Assure that the appropriate legal arrangements have been
made with all property owners affected by the increased flood
elevations; and
5. Notify all affected municipalities of increased regional
flood elevations.
(b) Amendment process. Upon completion of the steps in par.
(a), the municipality and any affected municipality shall meet all
legal requirements for amending its water surface profiles, floodplain
zoning maps and zoning ordinances as established in s. NR
116.21 (6).
(c) Submission to the department for approval. If the municipality
amends its official floodplain map, it shall also amend its
water surface profiles and floodplain zoning ordinance and submit
these amendments to the department for approval pursuant to
s. NR 116.21 (6). Prior to department approval, all municipalities
affected by the increased regional flood elevation shall amend
their water surface profiles, floodplain zoning maps and zoning
ordinances to reflect the increased regional flood elevations.
(4) EXCEPTION TO CRITERIA FOR REDELINEATING OR REZONING
FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS. If, as a result of improved data generated
by a revised study approved by the department, and not as a result
of changes due to encroachments in the floodplain, the hydraulic
floodway line is revised landward of the official floodway lines,
the municipality may continue to regulate on the basis of the official
floodway lines provided the municipality meets all of the
requirements of sub. (3), except the requirement of sub. (3) (a) 4.
History: Cr. Register, February, 1986, No. 362, eff. 3-1-86.

areas. (1) GENERAL. (a) Municipalities, using the appropriate
procedure described in s. NR 116.21, may issue permits allowing
uses in floodfringe areas which are compatible with the criteria in
this section.
(b) All floodfringe developments shall be compatible with
local land use plans. In the absence of formal plans, development
shall be compatible with the uses permitted in adjoining districts.
(c) Floodfringe developments may be permitted only if such
developments do not cause an obstruction to flood flows of any
tributaries to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage
facilities or systems or if amendments are made to the affected
official floodway lines, water surface profiles, floodplain zoning
maps and floodplain zoning ordinances in accordance with the
provisions of ss. NR 116.11 and 116.21 (6).
(d) Floodfringe developments may be permitted only if such
developments do not affect the conveyance capacity by causing
an obstruction to flow or storage capacity of the floodplains, such
that it causes any increase in the regional flood height or discharge.
(2) RESIDENTIAL USES. (a) Any structure or building used for
human habitation (seasonal or permanent), which is to be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered or moved into the
floodfringe area shall be place on fill with the finished surface of
the lowest floor, excluding basement or crawlway, at or above the
flood protection elevation. If any such structure or building has
a basement or crawlway, the surface of the floor of the basement
or crawlway shall be at or above the regional flood elevation and
shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in accordance
with s. NR 116.16. No variance may be granted to allow any
floor below the regional flood elevation. An exception to the

(b) For all uses under this subsection:
1. Fill shall be not less than one foot above the regional flood
elevation;
2. Fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond
the limits of any structure or building erected thereon; and
3. Dryland access shall be provided.
(c) If existing streets or sewer lines are at elevations which
make compliance with par. (b) impractical, the department may
approve the use of other floodproofing measures or methods in
accordance with s. NR 116.16. The structure or building shall be
floodproofed to the flood protection elevation.
(d) If existing streets or sewer lines are at elevations which
make compliance with par. (b) 3. impractical, the municipality
may permit new development and substantial improvements
where access roads are at an elevation lower than the regional
flood elevation, provided:
1. The municipality has an adequate natural disaster plan
which has been concurred in by the division of emergency government
and approved by the department; or
2. The municipality has written assurance from the appropriate
units of police, fire and emergency services that rescue and
relief can be provided by wheeled vehicles to the structures during
regional flooding, taking into account the anticipated depth, duration

NR 116.14 Development standards in other floodplain
areas. In cooperation with municipalities, and to insure
sound floodplain management, the department may designate or
approve the following floodplain districts, in addition to those
established in ss. NR 116.12 and 116.13, providing the criteria in
s. NR 116.11 are met:
(1) SHALLOW DEPTH FLOODING DISTRICT. The standards for
permitting development in a floodfringe area under s. NR 116.13
shall be applicable to a shallow depth flooding area except that
such development may not result in an obstruction to flood flows.
If development does cause an obstruction to flood flows, the
development may not be permitted unless the entire shallow depth
flooding district is rezoned to floodfringe district according to the
criteria established in s. NR 116.11 (2) (f).
(2) FLOOD STORAGE DISTRICT. (a) General. Municipalities
using the appropriate procedure described in s. NR 116.20, may
issue permits for development in flood storage areas which are
compatible with the criteria for floodfringe areas, as described in
s. NR 116.13, providing the provisions of par. (b) are met.
(b) Flood storage modifications. When any proposed development
would remove flood storage volume, an equal volume of
storage, as defined by the ground surface and the regional flood
elevation, shall be provided to compensate for the volume of storage
which is lost. Excavation below the groundwater table is not
considered as providing an equal volume of storage.
(c) Rezoning of flood storage district. If compensatory storage
cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the
entire flood storage district is rezoned to floodfringe district utilizing
the criteria established in s. NR 116.11 (2) (e).
(3) COASTAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT. The standards for permitting
development in a floodfringe area under s. NR 116.13 shall
be applicable in a coastal floodplain area, except that no development
may be allowed which:

buildings. (1) GENERAL. Insofar as the standards in this
section are not inconsistent with the provisions of ss. 59.69 (10)
and 62.23 (7) (h), Stats., they shall apply to all uses and buildings
that do not conform to the provisions contained within a floodplain
zoning ordinance. These standards apply to the modification
of, or addition to, any building and to the use of any building
or premises which was lawful before the passage of the ordinance.
The existing lawful use of a building or its accessory use which
is not in conformity with the provisions of a floodplain zoning
ordinance may be continued subject to the following conditions:
(a) No extension of a nonconforming use, or modification or
addition to any building with a nonconforming use or to any nonconforming
building, may be permitted unless they are made in
conformity with the provisions of this section. For the purposes
of this section, the words modification and addition shall
include, but not be limited to, any alteration, addition, modification,
rebuilding or replacement of any existing building, accessory
building or accessory use, except as provided in pars. (am)
and (as).
(am) For the purposes of this section, ordinary maintenance
repairs are not considered an extension, modification or addition;
ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and external painting,
decorating, paneling, the replacement of doors, windows and
other nonstructural components; and the maintenance, repair or
replacement of existing private sewage systems, water supply systems
or connections to public utilities;
(as) For the purposes of this section, the construction of a deck
that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the
exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification
or addition. The roof of the principal structure may extend
over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and
egress to the principal structure.
(b) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming
building is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer
permitted and any future use of the building shall conform with the
appropriate provisions contained in ss. NR 116.12, 116.13 and
116.14.
(c) No modification or addition to any nonconforming building
or any building with a nonconforming use, which over the life
of the building would exceed 50% of its present equalized
assessed value, may be allowed unless the entire building is permanently
changed to a conforming building with a conforming
use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter.
The costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building
with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are
excluded from the 50% provisions of this paragraph.
(d) If any nonconforming building or any building with a nonconforming
use is destroyed or is so badly damaged that it cannot
be practically restored, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or
rebuilt unless the provisions of ss. NR 116.12, 116.13 and 116.14
are met. For the purpose of this subsection, restoration is deemed
impracticable where the total cost of such restoration would
exceed 50% of the present equalized assessed value of the building.

NR 116.16 Floodproofing. (1) GENERAL STANDARDS.
When floodproofing measures are required by either a municipal
floodplain zoning ordinance or some other regulation which
incorporates by reference the floodproofing requirements of this
chapter, such measures shall be designed to withstand the flood
depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the regional flood, to assure that the structures
are watertight and completely dry to the flood protection
elevation without human intervention during flooding.
(2) CERTIFICATION. (a) Whenever floodproofing measures are
required, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the following floodproofing measures will be utilized,
where appropriate, and are adequate to withstand the flood depths,
pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the regional flood:
1. Anchorage of structures, or addition of mass or weight to
structures, to prevent flotation.
2. Reinforcement of walls and floors to resist rupture or collapse
caused by water pressures or floating debris.
3. Construction of wells, water supply systems and waste
treatment systems so as to prevent the entrance of flood waters
into such systems.
4. Subsurface drainage systems to relieve external pressures
on foundation walls and basement floors.
5. Cutoff valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity
flow basement drains.
6. Placement of essential utilities above the flood protection
elevation.

ordinance, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance
will result in unnecessary hardship. A variance:
(a) Shall be consistent with the spirit of the floodplain zoning
ordinance.
(b) May not permit a lower degree of flood protection in the
floodplain area than the flood protection elevation.
(c) May not be granted for a use that is common to a group of
adjacent lots or premises. In such a case, the zoning ordinance
would have to be amended through proper amendment procedures.
(d) May not be granted unless it is shown that the variance will
not be contrary to the public interest and will not be damaging to
the rights of other persons or property values in the area.
(e) May not be granted for actions which require an amendment
to the floodplain zoning ordinance as described in sub. (6).
(f) May not have the effect of granting, increasing or extending
a use of property which is prohibited in that zoning district by the
floodplain zoning ordinance.
(g) May not be granted solely on the basis of economic gain
or loss.
(h) May not be granted for a self-created hardship.
(5) APPEALS. Appeals to the board of adjustment or appeals or
zoning agency may be taken by any party aggrieved by any decision
of the zoning administrator. Requests for special exception

appeals shall specify the grounds thereof and be filed within a reasonable
period of time with the zoning administrator. The floodplain
zoning ordinance shall set forth the time limitations for filing
appeals. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the
board of adjustment or appeals or zoning agency all records of the
matter concerning the appeal. After public hearing, the boards or
agencys decision shall either affirm, reverse, vary or modify in
whole or in part the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from. All appeal decisions shall conform to the applicable
provisions of the floodplain zoning ordinance. The boards or
agencys decision may be appealed to the courts in accordance
with applicable state law.
(6) AMENDMENTS. (a) Official amendments are required for
any changes in the official floodway lines, water surface profiles,
floodplain zoning maps or floodplain zoning ordinance. Actions
which require an amendment by the municipality include, but are
not limited to, the following:
1. Any change in the official floodway lines or in the boundary
of the floodplain area;

WISCONSINS CITY AND VILLAGE SHORELAND-WETLAND PROTECTION PROGRAM
NR 117.01 Purpose.
NR 117.02 Applicability.
NR 117.03 Definitions.
NR 117.05 Shoreland-wetland protection standards.
NR 117.06 Department duties.
NR 117.01 Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to
establish minimum standards for city and village shoreland-wetland
zoning ordinances to accomplish the shoreland protection
objectives of s. 281.31, Stats. Cities and villages are required by
ss. 62.231 and 61.351, Stats., to adopt shoreland-wetland zoning
ordinances within 6 months after receipt of final wetland inventory
maps, which have been prepared by the department under s.
23.32, Stats.
History: Cr. Register, November, 1983, No. 335, eff. 12-1-83; correction made
under s. 13.93 (2m) (b) 7., Stats., Register, October, 1999, No. 526.
NR 117.02 Applicability. (1) The provisions of this chapter
are applicable to the adoption, administration and enforcement
of city and village shoreland-wetland zoning ordinances adopted
under ss. 62.231 and 61.351, Stats. Unless specifically exempted
by law, all cities and villages, towns, counties and, when s. 13.48
(13), Stats., applies, state agencies are required to comply with,
and obtain all necessary permits, under local shoreland-wetland
zoning ordinances.
(2) If a city or village ordinance adopted under s. 62.23, 61.35
or 87.30, Stats., affecting wetlands in a shoreland area is more
restrictive than an ordinance enacted under s. 62.231 or 61.351,
Stats., affecting the same lands, it continues to be effective in all
respects to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
History: Cr. Register, November, 1983, No. 335, eff. 12-1-83.
NR 117.03 Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter:
(1) City planning agency means a city plan commission
created under s. 62.23 (1), Stats., a board of public land commissioners
created under s. 27.11, Stats., or a committee of the city
council which acts on matters pertaining to city planning.
(2) Department means the department of natural resources.
(3) Environmental control facility means any facility, temporary
or permanent, which is reasonably expected to abate,
reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control or monitoring
of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste and thermal, radiation
or other pollutants, including facilities installed principally
to supplement or to replace existing property or equipment not
meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control
standards or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other
pollution control facilities.
(4) Farm drainage ditch means any artificial channel which
drains water from lands which are currently used for agricultural
purposes.
(5) Floodplain means the land which has been or may be
covered by flood water during the regional flood, as that term
is defined in s. NR 116.03. The floodplain includes the floodway
and the flood fringe.
(6) High-water mark means the mark left by water at its
highest level.
(7) Navigable water or navigable waters, as defined in s.
281.31 (2) (d), Stats., means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all
natural inland lakes within this state and all streams, ponds,
sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of
this state, including the Wisconsin portion of boundary waters,
which are navigable under the laws of this state. Notwithstanding
any other provision of law or administrative rule, a shoreland zoning
ordinance required under s. 59.692, Stats., and this chapter or
a wetland zoning ordinance required under s. 61.351 or 62.231,
Stats., and this chapter does not apply to lands adjacent to farm
drainage ditches if:
(a) Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream
or river;
(b) Those parts of the drainage ditches adjacent to these lands
were nonnavigable streams before ditching; and
(c) Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.
Note: In Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952), the Wisconsin
Supreme Court held that a stream is navigable in fact if it is capable of floating
any boat, skiff or canoe of the shallowest draft used for recreational purposes. In
DeGayner and Co., Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis.2d 936 (1975),
the court also held that a stream need not be navigable in its normal or natural condition
to be navigable in fact. The DeGayner opinion indicates that it is proper to consider
artificial conditions, such as beaver dams, where such conditions have existed
long enough to make a stream useful as a highway for recreation or commerce, and
to consider ordinarily recurring seasonal fluctuations, such as spring floods, in determining
the navigability of a stream.
(8) Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank
or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is
so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion,
destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance
of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristics.
Note: Where the bank or shore of any particular place is of such character that it
is difficult or impossible to ascertain where the point of ordinary high-water mark is,
recourse may be had to the opposite bank of a stream or to other places on the shore
of a lake or flowage to determine whether a given stage of water is above or below
the ordinary high-water mark.
(9) Shorelands, as defined in s. 59.692 (1) (b), Stats., means
the area within the following distances from the ordinary high-
water mark of navigable waters, as defined in s. 281.31 (2) (d),
Stats.:
(a) One thousand feet from a lake, pond or flowage. If the navigable
water is a glacial pothole lake, this distance shall be measured
from the high-water mark of the lake.
Note: The water level in a glacial pothole lake may remain above theordinary
high-water mark several years after flooding, resulting in ahigh-water mark
which is above the ordinary high-water mark. However, there would be no practical
difference between the high-water mark of a glacial pothole lake and the ordinary
high-water mark of a glacial pothole lake where the effects of such flooding
are no longer evident.
(b) Three hundred feet from a river or a stream or to the landward
side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.
(10) Special exception (conditional use) means a use which
is permitted by a zoning ordinance provided that certain conditions
specified in the ordinance are met and that a permit is granted
by the board of appeals or, where appropriate, the city or village
planning agency or governing body.
(11) Village planning agency means a village planning
commission created under ss. 61.35 and 62.23 (1), Stats., or a
committee of the village board which acts on matters pertaining
to village planning.
(12) Wetland, as defined in s. 23.32 (1), Stats., means an
area where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough
to be capable of supporting aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and
which has soils indicative of wet conditions.

village shall return the preliminary maps to the department. If city
or village officials believe that the preliminary maps are inaccurate,
discrepancies shall be noted on the maps with an accompanying
narrative explaining the problem areas.
5. The department shall schedule a meeting with city or village
officials within 30 days of the return of the preliminary maps
if the city or village has indicated that it believes that there are
inaccuracies on the preliminary maps.
6. After meeting with city or village officials to discuss apparent
map inaccuracies, the department shall, at department
expense, consult available soil survey maps and conduct on-site
inspections, if appropriate, in order to evaluate the city or village
recommendations, and shall then prepare, adopt and deliver to the
city or village the final wetland inventory maps for that city or village.
7. The adoption of a final wetland inventory map is a final
decision of the department and may be reviewed as provided in ch.
227, Stats.
(b) City and village adoption of shoreland-wetland zoning
regulations. 1. Except as provided in subd. 2. or 3., each city and
village shall adopt an ordinance or an amendment to an existing
ordinance or zoning code which creates a shoreland-wetland zoning
district for all wetlands of 5 acres or more, and all portions of
wetlands of 5 acres or more, which are shown on the final wetland
inventory maps and which are located in shorelands within the
incorporated area of the city or village. Such ordinance or amendment
shall be adopted within 6 months after receipt of the final
wetland inventory maps prepared by the department which cover
that city or village. Cities and villages have the option of zoning
any wetlands within their incorporated area, including wetlands
which are less than 5 acres in size, except those wetlands
described in subd. 2.
2. Subdivision 1. is not applicable to:
a. Any wetlands which are filled, prior to the date on which
the city or village receives applicable final wetland inventory
maps, in a manner that affects their wetland characteristics to the
extent that the area would no longer meet the definition of wetland
in s. NR 117.03; or
b. Any wetlands between the ordinary high-water mark and
a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982, under s. 30.11,
Stats., that are located on the landward side of the bulkhead line.
3. Subdivision 1. is not applicable to any wetlands which the
city or village rezones at the time that shoreland-wetland zoning
regulations are initially adopted, if the city or village and the
department have determined that such rezoning will have no significant
adverse impact upon the wetland functions listed in sub.
(4) (d). The provisions of sub. (4) (d) to (h) are applicable to such
rezoning. In order to rezone certain mapped wetlands at the time
that shoreland-wetland zoning regulations are initially adopted,
the city or village shall publish a separate class II notice and hold
a separate public hearing on the proposed rezoning in conjunction
with the public hearing on the adoption of the shoreland-wetland
zoning ordinance, or amendment to an existing ordinance or zoning
code, which is required by subd. 1.
4. A public hearing shall be held on the ordinance or amendment
to an existing ordinance or zoning code, which creates a shoreland-
wetland zoning district, as required by s. 62.23 (7) (d) 2.,
Stats. The appropriate district office of the department shall be
provided with a copy of the proposed shoreland-wetland ordinance
or amendment, and with written notice of the public hearing,
at least 10 days prior to such hearing.

(b) The department shall review all proposed amendments to
shoreland-wetland zoning regulations under s. NR 117.05 (4) (e),

proposed will retain its status of compliance with s. 62.231 or
61.351, Stats., and this chapter.
(3) DETERMINATION OF NONCOMPLIANCE. Cities and villages
which do not have shoreland-wetland zoning regulations in effect
within 6 months after receipt of final wetland inventory maps for
that city or village shall be deemed to be in noncompliance with
s. 62.231 or 61.351, Stats., and this chapter. Cities and villages
