CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE
CITY OF LADYSMITH
PREFACE
Democracy is a government of laws. Good democracy requires not only good laws, but laws which are readily available in written form to all who are subject to them, to the public officials and police officers who must administer them and to the judges and attorneys who must interpret and apply them. It is for this reason that the Common Council of the City of Ladysmith has adopted this Code of Ordinances. This Code represents the contribution of the Common Council to the democratic and efficient administration of the government and affairs of the City of Ladysmith.

The City of Ladysmith Administrative staff is pleased to provide this updated Code of Ordinances for the City of Ladysmith, Wisconsin. This codification provides a complete revision and codification of all Ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City. All amended Ordinances are brought up to date. The Code also includes certain new Ordinances that were prepared to fill gaps not covered by existing Ordinances.
The Code also includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter.
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered by Title 1 of the Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references and amendment notes have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions.
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the City officials in the preparation of this Code.

OPEN MEETING LAW GUIDE
General Requirements
1. Wisconsin's Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental bodies shall be open to all citizens at all times. Sec. 19.81(2), Wis. Stats.
2. Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in places reasonably accessible
to the public.
3. Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically provided otherwise by law.
4. When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to compose a quorum, that
meeting is presumed to be convened for the purpose of conducting official business. Such a meeting
is in violation of The Open Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the meeting is not open
to the public. Sec. 19.82(2), Wis. Stats.
5. The Open Meeting Law also applies when members of a governing body, or committee thereof,
engage in business of that body and when the number of members present is potentially sufficient to
determine the governing body's course of action regarding the proposal discussed State vs. Showers
No. 85-471, (June 15, 1987).
Public Notice
1. WHO MUST RECEIVE NOTICE. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her designee, shall
give notice to the official newspaper and to any other members of the news media who have filed a
written request to receive such notices, or if neither exists, in a manner likely to give notice to the
public. Notice must also be given as required by any other state statutes.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF NOTICE. The notice for the meeting shall include:
a. The time, date and place of the meeting, and
b. The subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered in closed session.
The governmental body may discuss and, if urgent, act upon matters which were not specifically
referred to in the agenda where the agenda contains a general item, such as "miscellaneous
business." Where the presiding officer has specific knowledge that matters may come before the
body, they should be included on the agenda.
3. TIME FOR NOTICE. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
commencement of the meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in
which case shorter notice may be given. In no case may notice be provided less than two (2) hours
in advance of the meeting. Sec. 19.84(3), Wis. Stats.
vi
4. COMMITTEES AND SUBUNITS EXEMPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. A legally constituted subunit of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of the governing body's meeting or immediately after the lawful meeting to act or deliberate upon a matter which was the subject of that meeting. For this exemption to apply, the presiding officer must publicly announce the time, place and subject matter of the subunit's meeting in advance at the meeting of the governing body.
Procedure For Closed Sessions
1. Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee knows that a closed
session is being contemplated. Notice is required regardless of whether a majority of members will or will not support going into closed session at the meeting. Sec. 19.84(2), Wis. Stats.
2. After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, a motion made and recorded and supported by majority vote, is required to close, with the vote of each member recorded in the minutes. Sec. 19.85(1), Wis. Stats.
3. If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall announce to those present at the meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the nature of the business to be considered in the closed session and the specific exemption(s) relied upon in Sec. 19.85, Wis. Stats., under which the closed session is permitted.
4. Only matters contained in the presiding officer's announcement of the closed session may be
considered during the closed session.
5. An open session, with adequate notice, must precede a closed session, even where it was decided at a prior open session to go into a closed session at a subsequent meeting.
6. A governmental body may vote to go into closed session at a properly convened open session, for a permitted purpose, where specific notice of intent to consider going into closed session was not included on the agenda at the time notice of the open session was given. However, such procedure requires that the presiding officer or his/her designee did not contemplate or have knowledge that any of the other members contemplated a closed session at the time notice of the agenda was given.
Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions
1. Sec. 19.85(l)(a), Wis. Stats., creates an exemption for governmental bodies deliberating after quasi-judicial trials or hearings. However, boards of review cannot rely on this exemption, for Sec. 70.47(2m), Wis. Stats., requires all board of review meetings to be held in open session.
2. Sec. 19.85(l)(b), Wis. Stats., is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law allowing the use of a closed session when a governmental body is considering the demotion, dismissal, licensing, discipline or tenure of a public employee or a person licensed by a board or commission. This exception permits preliminary discussion and investigation without the necessity of providing actual notice to the individual involved. However, before any evidentiary hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must be given to the person involved so that he or she can exercise his or her right to request an open session for those purposes.
3. Sec. 19.85(l)(c), Wis. Stats., sanctions the use of closed sessions where governmental bodies are considering employment, promotion, compensation or performance evaluation of any public employee. Governmental bodies should exercise caution when considering performance to avoid discussing matters that are covered by Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats.
vii
4. Sec. 19.85(l)(c), Wis. Stats., permits the use of closed sessions when applications for parole or probation are being considered, or when crime detection or prevention strategy is to be discussed.
5. Sec. 19.85(l)(e), Wis. Stats., allows closed sessions for the purpose of deliberating or negotiating the purchase of public properties, the investing of public funds, or the conducting of other specified public business, as long as competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed session. Under this exception, a governmental body could meet in closed session for the purpose of forming negotiation strategies, although the body must give notice that an open session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to convene in closed session for the purpose of discussing labor negotiation strategies.
6. Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if conducted in public, would have a "substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to" may be held in closed session under Sec. 19.85(l)(f), Wis. Stats. However, this exemption is unavailable where Sec. 19.85(l)(b), Wis. Stats., is applicable.
7. Sec. 19.85(l)(g), Wis. Stats., allows a governmental body to confer with its legal counsel in closed session for the purpose of obtaining oral or written advice concerning strategy to be adopted by the body with respect to present and prospective litigation directly involving the governmental body.
8. Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for confidential written advice from ethics boards under Sec. 19.85(l)(h), Wis. Stats.
Limitations on Closed Sessions
1. Sec. 19.85(2), Wis. Stats., makes it impermissible for a governmental body to reconvene in open session within twelve (12) hours after a closed session, unless public notice of the subsequent open session was given at the same time and in the same manner as was required for the original open session.
2. Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required to be in open session under Sec. 19.85(3), Wis. Stats. However, a governmental body can vote to preliminarily approve bargaining proposals in closed session, in order to reach a consensus, as long as final ratification occurs in open session.
Ballots, Votes and Records
1. Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a governmental body to determine any election or decision, except the election of the officers of such body. This narrow exception does not permit the use of secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers of the governmental units such as department heads, or fill vacancies on the body itself.
2. Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote.
3. Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public inspection.
viii
Use of Equipment in Meetings
1. A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media's equipment.
2. Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided that the use of this equipment does not interfere with the conduct of the meeting(s).
2. A member of a governmental body does not have the right to electronically record a closed session of the Common Council.

(a) The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established in this Chapter a Code of Ethics for all City of Ladysmith officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions of the City, as well as any individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the City.

The Common Council believes that a Code of Ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this City in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The Common Council hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed City official and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this Ethics Code and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the City of Ladysmith.

(a) Financial and Personal Interest Prohibited.
(1) No official or employee of the City, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall act in regard to financial or other personal interest, directly or indirectly, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties in the public interest contrary to the provisions of this Chapter or which would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties.

(c) Gifts and Favors.
(1) No official or employee, personally or through a member of his immediate family, may solicit or accept, either directly or indirectly, from any person or organization, money or anything of value if it could be expected to influence the employee's official actions or judgments or be considered a reward for any action or inaction on the part of the official or employee.
(2) No official or employee personally, or through a member of his immediate family, shall accept any gift of a greater value than Twenty Dollars ($20.00), whether in the form of money, service, loan, thing or promise, from any person which may tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his duties or grant in the discharge of his duties any improper favor, service or thing of value. However, it is not a conflict of interest for any public official or employee to receive a gift or gratuity that is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value of less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00), such as a meal, and that is not intended to influence the official. Any official or employee who receives, directly or indirectly, any gift or gifts having an aggregate value of more than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) within any calendar year from any person who is known by said official or employee to be interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the City upon which the official or employee has an influence or input or over which the official or employee has any jurisdiction, discretion or control shall disclose the nature and value of such gifts to the Common Council by January 15 next following the year in which the gift or gifts are received.

Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. This paragraph further shall not be construed to prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality from citizens for the purpose of supporting the candidate's campaign.
(4) Gifts received by an official or employee or his immediate family under unusual circumstances shall be referred to the Common Council within ten (10) days of receipt for recommended disposition. Any person subject to this Chapter who becomes aware that he is or has been offered any gift, the acceptance of which would constitute a violation of this Subsection, shall, within ten (10) days, disclose the details surrounding said offer to the Common Council. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement shall constitute an offense under this Chapter.
(d) Representing Private Interests Before City Agencies or Courts.
(1) Non-elected City officials and employees shall not appear on behalf of any private person (other than him or herself, his or her spouse or minor children) before any City agency, board, commission or the Common Council if the official or employee or any board, commission or committee of which the official or employee is a member has any jurisdiction, discretion or control over the matter which is the subject of such representation.

(f) Contracts with the City. No City official or employee who, in his capacity as such officer or employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he has a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring the exercise of

Advisory requests shall be kept confidential, except when disclosure is authorized by the requestor, in which case the request and opinion may be made public.
(b) The City Attorney or the Chairman of the Board of Ethics may provide an answer verbally or in writing or may bring the question to the full board who shall consider the question at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The requestor of the opinion may also request that the full board review the opinion of the City Attorney or Chairman of the Board of Ethics. If no meeting is scheduled, it shall be considered at a meeting to be scheduled upon appropriate notice, and held within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the question.

SEC. 2-5-9 HIRING RELATIVES.
(a) This Section governs the proposed hiring of individuals for full-time or part-time work as City employees who are members of the immediate family of City employees or elected officials. "Immediate family" includes those relatives by blood or marriage defined in Section 2-5-2(e) as personal interests.
(b) Hiring an immediate family member of any current City employee or elected City official is discouraged and will be considered only if that individual has the knowledge and skills, experience or other job-related qualifications that warrant consideration for the position. It is required that either the current employee or the relative seeking employment will make the personal interest relationship known to the hiring authority (department head, City board or commission or Common Council) before a hiring decision is made; in every case, the decision to hire an immediate family member or former spouse will be subject to Common Council approval, with notice, before the new employee is permitted to begin work. Marriage between two (2) individuals already employed by the City or their relatives will not be considered a violation of this policy.
(c) This Section does not apply to non-elected officials who are asked to accept appointment as members of a City board, commission or committee; non-elected officials, however, will be expected to disqualify themselves from participation in matters under consideration which may affect the hiring, retention, classification or compensation of their immediate family if currently employed or being considered for employment by the City.

Title 3 Special Assessments
63
ARTICLE B
Specific Special Assessment Policies for
Public Improvements in Existing Developed Areas
SEC. 3-2-20 PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT POLICIES.
This Article is intended to be a guideline to establish:
(a) Minimum street construction standards to insure an adequate base, good drainage and durable surfaces.
(b) Minimum utility construction standards to provide for adequate sanitary sewer, water service and storm sewer.
(c) Special assessment policies to insure equitable distribution of project costs between the City and property owners.
SEC. 3-2-21 PROCEDURE FOR PETITION FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
(a) Lot owners desiring public improvements such as water main, sewers and curb and gutter shall file a petition with the City Clerk. Sample petitions are available at the City Clerk's office. These petitions shall be on file before September 30 of any given year in order to be considered in the budget for the following year. The amount of construction is limited within the budget of the City, and additional work is delayed until funds are available.
(b) The Common Council will hold a public hearing prior to levying special assessments, per Sec. 66.0703, Wis. Stats.
(c) Normally, the Common Council approves petitions which are signed by property owners who own over fifty percent (50%) of the frontage abutting the proposed improvement. However, the Common Council has authority to reject any petition and, on its own motion, order a public improvement.
(d) Special assessment charges are based on the cost of improvement and the benefits to adjoining property. It is impossible for the City to evaluate adjacent property, so the maximum benefit to the property is usually considered equal to the total cost of the improvement. Present use of property by non-profit organizations does not reduce or eliminate assessments, because the property itself is benefitted directly and the use of the property may change.
(e) The City may contract for such work to be done by the lowest bidder if deemed reasonable in cost, or it may have the work done by persons employed by the City.
SEC. 3-2-22 DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this Article, the terms or words herein shall be interpreted or defined as follows:
(a) Abutting Frontage. The part of a lot, parcel or property which abuts or fronts on an improvement.
(b) Building Setback Line. A line parallel to the lot line at a distance regulated by the yard requirements set up in this Code.
(c) Irregular Lot. A lot within a subdivision abutting a cul-de-sac or curved street which is approximately equal in area to other lots within the subdivision, however having unusually short abutting frontage in comparison to the other lots.
(d) Lateral. Service line connecting a single property or building with a main.
(e) Long Frontage. The long side of a corner lot regardless of building orientation.
(f) Functional Street System Map. A map showing streets classified as arterial, collector, local or rural as determined by the City Council.
(g) Remote Lots. Lots or parcels without abutting frontage which receive benefit from an improvement.
(h) Short Frontage. The short side of a corner lot regardless of building orientation.
(i) Subdivision. See definition in Title 14 of the City of Ladysmith Code of Ordinances.

Title 3 Special Assessments
71
(2) Where the municipality is unwilling to make a special assessment because of low density of prospective consumers or for some other reason, extensions will be made on a customer-financed basis as follows:
a. The following definitions shall be applicable in Subsection (b)(2):
1. Customers. The word "customer" as used in this rule means the owner of premises to which water or sewer is now or is to be furnished unless specific written agreements specify otherwise. The customer at all times means the property owner at the time a contribution is to be made or a refund becomes available.
2. Contributor. The word "contributor" means the owner of property at the time of a contribution or refund unless otherwise specified by written agreement.
b. Basis for determining contributions from original customer(s). The applicant (or applicants, prorata) will advance the amount that would have been assessed under Sections 3-2-23 through 3-2-29 above. The contribution must be paid in advance of construction.
c. Additional customers and refunds.
1. When additional customers are connected to a water main that was originally financed in part by customers, the utility will require a contribution from each new customer equal to the existing average contribution. When the amount of contribution computed under Subsection (2)b above is less than would have been assessed under Sections 3-2-23 through 3-2-29 above, the applicant for service shall pay an amount equivalent to the assessment. This amount shall then be refunded prorata to all contributors along the extension whose remaining contribution still exceeds what would have been assessed under Section 3-2-23 through 3-2-29.
2. When refunds have refunded the contribution of any contributor to the applicable assessment per front foot, no further refund will be made to that individual. After all refunds have been made, the remaining premises that may connect will be charged at the rate per front foot established for the extension.
3. The development period during which refunds shall be made will be limited to twenty (20) years.
d. Limit of extension. When an extension beyond an existing extension is required to serve a new customer and the cost for a customer exceeds the average remaining contribution in the original extension, then the new extension will be considered as an entirely new project, without refunds or other connection with the original extension.
SEC. 3-2-32 FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER AID FOR CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS.
If financial assistance is received from the federal government, State of Wisconsin or other authority for improvements and assessments are permitted by the assistance program, such assessments shall be made in accordance with this Article, except as provided in Section 3-2-34(a)(2).

(2) Such variance will promote a public purpose in keeping with a state or federal improvement program being undertaken through provisions of an incentive; and
(3) The variance will not violate the purpose of this Chapter.
(b) The reason for granting such variance shall be fully documented in the official minutes or transcripts of the meeting(s) at which it is discussed or acted upon.
SEC. 3-2-35 DEFERRING PAYMENT OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
(a) Purpose. The city council acknowledges that the levy of special assessments can result in extreme financial hardship in some instances. It therefore enacts this provision in order to provide necessary relief to persons affected by such a levy. It is the intent and purpose of the city council to alleviate the burden of such levies in cases where the loss of the homestead is a reasonable probability, while preserving the right for the ultimate collection of a special assessment involved.
(b) Definitions. Wherever in this section the following words or terms appear they have the meaning indicated, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
(1) “Indigent person” means a natural person owning and occupying a homestead against which special assessments are levied in an amount which, when considered with the overall financial condition of the person, will, within a reasonable probability, require the sale of the homestead to satisfy the payment of such special assessments.
(2) “Homestead” means the dwelling and so much of the land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for use as a home, except so much of such land as is vacant and of sufficient size so that it could be divided and sold for development as permitted under appropriate zoning and other regulations.
(3) “Board” means the Revolving Loan Fund Administration Board.
(4) “Special assessment” shall include assessments levied under s. 66.0701, et seq Wisconsin Statutes.
(c) Assumption by the City. The city council may determine, following due application, consideration and recommendationby the board, to assume and pay on behalf of any indigent person, all or part of any special assessment, or installment thereof. Upon the granting of an application, the payment of all or part of such special assessment shall be deemed to be deferred, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions as set forth by the city council and this section.
(d) Application. Applications for a deferment under this section shall be filed with the board clerk on forms provided by the city. The information on the form shall be sworn to by the applicant. The board shall consider the net worth, family status, amount of proposed special assessments, and all other factors relating to a determination if the applicant is an indigent person. The board shall thereafter make its recommendation on the application to the city council. The city council shall make the final determination as to the granting of the application.
(1) The application shall contain the following information:
a. Age and employment of applicant;

This Subsection does not apply to members of the Common Council.
SEC. 3-3-5 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 3-3-4(f)(5). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 3-3-6. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Sec. 19.37(l), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or district attorney.
SEC. 3-3-6 LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS.
(a) As provided in Sec. 19.36, Wis. Stats. and the guidelines listed therein, the following records are exempt from inspection under this Chapter.
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;

77

(c) In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.
(2) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.

(5) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(l)(e), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of City property, investing of City funds, or other City business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.

Stats.
(8) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(l)(h), Wis. Stats., requests for confidential written advice from an ethics board, and records of advice given by such ethics board on such requests.
(d) If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.
(e) Whenever the Assessor, in the performance of the Assessor’s duties, requests or abtains income and expense information pursuant to Section 70.47(7)(af), Wis. Stats., or any successor statute thereto, then, such income and expense information that is provided to the Assessor shall be held by the Assessor on a confidential basis, except, however, that the information may be revealed to and used by persons: in the discharging of duties imposed by law; in the discharge of duties imposed by office (including, but not limited to, use by the Assessor in performance of official duties of the Assessor’s office and use by the Board of Review in performance of its official duties); or pursuant

Ord 2010-10 adopted 5/6/2010. Separate accounts are to be kept for false alarms as to criminal activity and false alarms for fire or other emergencies.
All false alarms responded to by Fire Department firefighting personnel and apparatus, in addition
to a police response, shall also follow the fee schedule established by the City of Ladysmith, which
fee schedule is permanently on file in the Clerk’s office and will be made available for inspection
upon request. Ord 2010-10 adopted 5/6/2010.
This subsection is intended to impose a strict liability on the person, business, corporation or other entity responsible for alarm connection to either the police alarm panel or to alarm receiving firm to which the Police or Fire Department have responded and shall be applied regardless of the cause of the false alarm excepting those alarms excluded from the definition of "False Alarm." Failure to pay such administrative charge in and of itself shall constitute a violation of this Section. Such charge shall be collectible as a forfeiture upon prosecution and conviction thereof, together with an additional forfeiture which may be imposed under the next Subsection (d) hereof for violation of this Section for allowing or maintaining condition(s) or act(s) violative of the intent of this Section of eliminating and minimizing the occurrence of false alarms, together with costs of prosecution.
(d) Waiver of Fee. If a possessor of the alarm shows to the satisfaction of the Chief of Police or the Fire Chief, as applicable, that such false alarm was not the result of negligence or improper maintenance, or other good and sufficient cause beyond the reasonable control of the possessor of the alarm, such fee may be waived and the response shall not count as a false alarm in computing the fee established under Subsection (c).
(e) Other Violations.

If such cause is found to exist, the Common Council may set such terms as it deems appropriate to the continuation of the license with respect to minimum days of operation or a time frame within which the subject premises must open for business to avoid cancellation of the subject license(s).
(2) Notice and Hearing. Prior to cancellation of any license, the City Clerk shall notify the licensee in writing of the City's intention to cancel the license for nonuse and provide the licensee with an opportunity for a hearing. Such notice shall also specify the time, place and date of the hearing, which shall be not less than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice. Such hearing shall be conducted as provided in accordance with Sec. 125.12(2)(b), Wis. Stats., or any amendments thereto.

In addition, any resident may file a sworn, written complaint with the City Clerk. Such summons shall be served not less than three (3) and not more than ten (10) days before the time at which the licensee is commanded to appear and may be served personally upon the licensee or the agent of the licensee or upon the person in charge of the licensed premises. The complaint shall be served with the summons and shall set forth the offense allegedly committed, the date and place of said offence and the facts constituting the alleged offense.

(2) Procedure on Hearing: Effect of Revocation.
a. The Mayor or, in his absence, the Council President shall conduct the hearing, administer oaths to all witnesses and may issue subpoenas.

b. If the complaint is found to be true, the licensee shall pay to the City the actual cost of the proceedings. If the complaint is found by the Common Council to be malicious and without probable cause, the complainant shall pay the cost of the proceedings in the same amount.
c. When a license is revoked, it shall be so entered of record by the City Clerk, and no other license shall be granted to such licensee or for such premises for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the revocation, nor shall any part of the money paid as application fee for any license so revoked be refunded.

Further, the Council, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two (2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one (1) year or more.

(f) Access. Access to any site, public or private, where a prohibited discharge is indicated or suspected shall be provided to the Fire Chief and County Emergency Government Director for purposes of evaluating the threat to the public and monitor containment, cleanup and restoration.
(g) Public Protection. Should any prohibited discharge occur that reasonably causes a threat to the life, safety or health of the public, the senior fire officer on the scene may order an evacuation of the area or take other appropriate protective steps for a period of time as deemed necessary for the safety of the public.
(h) Enforcement. The Fire Chief shall have authority to issue citations or complaints under this Section.

No person shall cause an ultralight aircraft to land or to take off from any property without permission of the owner or occupant of said property, provided that an emergency landing may be made to prevent a catastrophe. In the case of landing or taking off from a City public park or other City property, the operator of such ultralight aircraft shall first obtain a permit from the Common Council.

(1) The name, address and telephone number of the person filing the application;

Title 12 Park & Recreation Regulations
349
as a condition of granting such use the providing of the surety bond and liability insurance specified herein. In making this determination, the nature of the proposed use, the nature of the subject park property and the reasonable adaptability of the same to such use, the number of persons expected to use such park property under such permit, the past experience the City and other governmental subdivisions have had with this type of use in parks, the effect such use would be likely to have on the neighborhood adjacent to such park property, and the nature of the organization or group that would be using such park property under such permit shall be considered. The Park Board shall not discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in making such determination. In no case shall a permit be granted, or a permit be extended, for a use of park property under the provisions of this Section if it reasonably appears that such use would effect, or is effecting, to a substantial extent, either at the location of subject park property or in the neighborhood adjacent to such property, an interference with fire or police protection, physical damage to persons or property, a disturbance of the peace, or a health hazard.
(d) Surety Bond.
(1) The surety bond to be furnished the City if required hereunder shall be in the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), and conditioned on:
a. The person or organization to whom such a permit is issued, and heirs or successors and assigns, indemnifying the City against any and all loss or damage to City property;
b. Full and complete protection of the City against any and all litigation growing out of the granting of such use or anything done under such permit;

d. Faithful performance and observance of all the terms and conditions of the permit; and
e. Prompt and full payment of all compensation required by the City as a condition of such use of park property, if any such compensation is required. The surety shall not cover personal injury or property damage resulting to persons or organizations other than the City of Ladysmith.
(2) The liability insurance that shall be furnished the City if required hereunder shall provide liability insurance coverage for the operations under such permit of the person or organization, including its members, to whom the permit is issued. Such insurance coverage shall be in the minimum amounts of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) for the injury or death of any one (1) person in any one (1) accident or occurrence, Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00) for the injury or death of any number of persons in any one (1) accident or occurrence, and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) for property damage in any one (1) accident or occurrence; and both the person or organization and the City shall be insured thereunder. Separate policies or certificates of insurance showing the person or organization to be covered under one policy and the City to be covered under another policy may be filed in lieu of a single policy or certificate, at the option of the person or organization.

(e) Grievances. Any person or organization aggrieved by any determination of the Park Board made under any provision of this Section may appeal such determination to the Common Council by setting forth the details of such grievance in a letter to it, with a copy to the Park Board. Not less than three (3) weeks after the filing of such letter, such person or organization shall personally appear before the Common Council to show why he is aggrieved and why and how such determination should be modified or reversed. The Common Council shall then make a final determination of the matter in controversy and shall sustain, modify, or reverse the determination made by the Park Board.

(f) Relationship with Other Laws. Where the conditions imposed by any part of this Chapter upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this Chapter or any other laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules or regulations of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) shall be enforced.
SEC. 13-1-11 USE REGULATIONS.
Only the following uses and their essential services may be allowed in any district:

(b) Accessory Uses. Accessory uses and structures as specified are permitted in any district but not until their principal structure is present or under construction.
(c) Conditional Uses.
(1) Conditional uses and their accessory uses are considered as special uses requiring, for their authorization, review, public hearing and approval by the Plan Commission in accordance with Article E of this Chapter excepting those existent at time of adoption of the Zoning Code.
(2) Conditional use(s), when replaced by permitted use(s), shall terminate. In such case(s), the reestablishment of any previous conditional use(s), or establishment of new conditional use(s) shall require review, public hearing and approval by the Plan Commission in accordance with Article E of this Chapter.

Title 13 Zoning Code
359
(d) Classification of Unlisted Uses. Any use not specifically listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in the districts established in Section 13-1-20 shall be considered to be prohibited except as may be otherwise specifically provided hereinafter. In case of question as to the classification of an unlisted use, the question shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals for determination, following a recommendation from the Plan Commission, in accordance with the following procedure:
(1) Application. Application for determination for classification of an unlisted use shall be made in writing to the Zoning Administrator and shall include a detailed description of the proposed use and such other information as may be required by the Plan Commission to facilitate the determination.
(2) Investigation. The Plan Commission shall make or have made such investigations as it deems necessary in order to compare the nature and characteristics of the proposed use with those of the uses specifically listed in the Chapter and to recommend its classification.
(3) Determination. The determination of the Board of Appeals shall be rendered in writing within sixty (60) days from the application and shall include findings supporting the conclusion. The Commission shall determine if the classification of the unlisted use is a permitted use, conditional use or prohibited use in one (1) or more of the districts established in Section 13-1-20.
(4) Effective Date of Determination. At the time of this determination of the classification of the unlisted use by the Board of Appeals, the classification of the unlisted use shall become effective.
SEC. 13-1-12 SITE REGULATIONS.
(a) Street Frontage. All lots shall abut upon a public street or other officially approved means of access, and each lot shall have a minimum frontage of forty (40) feet; however, to be buildable, the lot shall comply with the frontage requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
(b) Principal Structures. All principal structures shall be located on a lot. Except in the case of planned unit developments, not more than one (1) principal building or use and its accessory buildings or uses may be located on a lot. The Plan Commission may permit as a conditional use or planned unit development more than one (1) principal structure per lot in any district where more than one (1) such structure is needed for the orderly development of the parcel. Where additional structures are permitted, the Plan Commission may impose additional yard requirements, landscaping requirements or parking requirements, or require a minimum separation distance between principal structures.
(c) Dedicated Street. All lots shall abut a public street or approved private road or way which is constructed to applicable standards. No zoning permit shall be issued for a lot which abuts a public street dedicated to only a portion of its proposed width and located on that side thereof from which the required dedication has not been secured.
(d) Lots Abutting More Restrictive Districts. Lots abutting more restrictive district boundaries shall provide side and rear yards not less than those required in the more restrictive abutting district. The street yard setbacks in the less restrictive district shall be modified for a distance of not less than sixty (60) feet from the more restrictive district boundary line so such street yard setbacks shall be no less than the average of the street yards required in both districts.
(e) Site Suitability. No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is held unsuitable for such use or structure by the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography, low percolation rate or bearing strength, erosion susceptibility or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of this community. The Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of the Section, shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for certain uses. The applicant shall have an opportunity to present evidence contesting such unsuitability if he
so desires. Thereafter, the Plan Commission may affirm, modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability when making its recommendation to the Common Council.
(f) Preservation of Topography. In order to protect the property owner from possible damage due to change in the existing grade of adjoining lands and to aid in preserving and protecting the natural
Title 13 Zoning Code
360
beauty and character of the landscape, no change in the existing topography of any land shall be made which would result in increasing any portion of the slope to a ratio greater than one and one-half (1-1/2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, within a distance of twenty (20) feet from the property line, except with the written consent of the owner of the abutting property and with the approval of the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or which would alter the existing drainage or topography in any way as to adversely affect the adjoining property. In no case shall any slope exceed the normal angle of slippage of the material involved, and all slopes shall be protected against erosion.
(g) Decks; Handicap Access Ramps. For purposes of this Chapter, decks and porches shall be considered a part of a building or structure.

PUD Planned Unit Development Procedures
SEC. 13-1-50 PURPOSE OF THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
Planned Unit Developments are intended to provide for greater flexibility in design and to provide for a combination of uses in a manner compatible to each and to the surrounding environment. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is any development to be constructed and maintained by a single owner or group of owners acting through a corporation located on a single tract, planned as an entity and, therefore, acceptable for development and regulation as one (1) land unit. Planned Unit Developments are established to encourage and promote improved environmental design in the City of Ladysmith by allowing for greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the development of land while insuring substantial compliance to the basic intent of the zoning ordinance and the general plan for community development. The PUD concept allows diversification and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive, unified projects. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic development in regard to public services and encourage and facilitate preservation of open land.
SEC. 13-1-51 PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
(a) Dimensional Requirements. With PUD's, the requirements for lot area, lot width, side yard, rear yard, front yard, lot coverage and building height shall be consistent with sound planning and zoning principles. However, lots and buildings may be approved which do not meet the dimensional requirements in other districts of this Chapter. Such requirements as are made a part of an approved recorded precise development plan shall be, along with the recorded plat itself, construed to be and enforced in accordance with this Chapter.
(b) Conditional Uses. Any use allowed only as a conditional use in any of the other Districts of this Chapter may be permitted subject to the criteria as established in Section 13-1-56 following, but such requirements as are made a part of an approved recorded precise development plan shall be, along with the recorded plan itself, construed to be and enforced as a part of the Chapter.
(c) Single Parcel Lot or Tract. Each PUD shall be considered as one (1) tract, lot or parcel, and the legal description must define said PUD as a single parcel, lot or tract and be so recorded with the County Register of Deeds.
Title 13 Zoning Code
374
(d) Off-Street Parking. In each PUD, off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with Article G of this Chapter.
(e) Signs. In each PUD, signs shall be classified and permitted in accordance with Article H, Sign Regulations.
SEC. 13-1-52 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
As a basis for determining the acceptability of a Planned Unit Development application to the Plan Commission and Common Council, the following criteria shall be applied to the application for such district with specific consideration as to whether or not it is consistent with the spirit and intent of this Chapter, is consistent with the policies of the City development plan, has been prepared with professional advice and guidance and produces significant benefits in terms of environmental design:
(a) Character and Intensity of Land Use. In a Planned Unit Development, the uses proposed and their intensity and arrangement on the site shall be of a visual and operational character which:
(1) Are compatible to the physical nature of the site with particular concern for preservation of natural features, tree growth and open space.
(2) Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecologic desirability, economic stability and functional practicality compatible with the general development plans for the area as established by the community.
(3) Would not adversely affect the anticipated provision for school or other municipal services.
(4) Would not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with the existing or proposed facilities to serve it.
(b) Economic Feasibility and Impact. The proponents of a Planned Unit Development application shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Plan Commission and Common Council of its economic feasibility, of available adequate financing, and that it would not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the City or the values of surrounding properties.
(c) Engineering Design Standards. The width of street rights-of-way, width of paving, width and location of street or other paving, outdoor lighting, location of sewer and water lines, provision for storm water drainage or other similar environmental engineering consideration shall be based on standards necessary to implement the specific function in the specific situation, provided, however, in no case shall standards be less than those necessary to insure the public safety and welfare as determined by the City designated engineer.
(d) Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space. In a Planned Unit Development, adequate provisions shall be made for the permanent preservation and maintenance of "open space" either by private reservation or dedication to the public.
(1) In the case of private reservation, the open area to be reserved shall be protected against building development by conveying to the City as part of the conditions for project approval an open space easement over such open areas restricting the area against any future building or use except as consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and recreational benefit of the PUD. Buildings or uses for noncommercial, recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the development plan or, subsequently, with the express approval of the Common Council following approval of building, site and operational plans by the Plan Commission.
(2) The care and maintenance of such open space reservations shall be assured by establishment of appropriate management organization for the project. The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such cost to individual properties shall be included in any contractual agreement with the City and shall be included in the title to each property.
(3) Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservations shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City and made a part of the conditions of the plan approval.
(e) Implementation Schedule. The proponents of a Planned Unit Development shall submit a reasonable schedule for the implementation of the development to the satisfaction of the Common Council, including suitable provisions for assurance that each phase could be brought to completion in a manner which would not result in an adverse effect upon the community as a result of termination at that point.

Conditional Uses
SEC. 13-1-60 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE -- CONDITIONAL USES.
The development and execution of this Article is based upon the division of the City into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses.
SEC. 13-1-61 AUTHORITY OF THE PLAN COMMISSION; REQUIREMENTS.
(a) The Plan Commission may authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit for either regular or limited conditional use after review and public hearing, provided that such conditional use and involved structure(s) are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. In the instance of the granting of a limited conditional use, the Plan Commission in its findings shall further specify the delimiting reason(s) or factors which resulted in issuing limited rather than regular conditional use. Such Plan Commission resolution, and the resulting conditional use permit, when, for limited conditional use, shall specify the period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee, the location and legal description of the affected premises. Prior to the granting of a conditional use, the Commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards herein prescribed are being complied with.
(b) Any development within five hundred (500) feet of the existing or proposed rights-of-way of freeways, expressways and within one-half (1/2) mile of their existing or proposed interchange or turning lane rights-of-way shall be specifically reviewed by the highway agency that has jurisdiction over the traffic way. The Plan Commission shall request such review and await the highway agency's recommendation for a period not to exceed twenty (20) days before taking final action.
(c) Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements may be required by the Plan Commission upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
(d) Compliance with all other provisions of this Chapter, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access and performance standards shall be required of all conditional uses.
SEC. 13-1-62 INITIATION OF CONDITIONAL USE.
Any person, firm, corporation or organization having a freehold interest or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable in the land for which a conditional use is sought may file an application to use such land for one (1) or more of the conditional uses in the zoning district in which such land is located.

The Plan Commission shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in addition to the enforcement authority of the Zoning Administrator to order the removal or discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved conditional use, and the elimination, removal or discontinuance of any violation of a condition imposed prior to or after approval or violation of any other provision of this Code. Upon written complaint by any citizen or official, the Plan Commission shall initially determine whether said complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the subject conditional use is in violation of either one (1) or more of the standards set forth in Section 13-1-66 above, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed hereunder. Upon reaching a positive initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice as provided in Section 13-1-65 above. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person or represented by an agent or attorney. The Plan Commission may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth in Section 13-1-66 or conditions previously imposed by the Plan Commission, modify existing conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use. Additionally, the offending party may be subjected to a forfeiture as set forth in this Chapter and Section 1-1-7. In the event that no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be made in order to assure that Standards (a) and (b) in Section 13-1-66 will be met, the Plan Commission may revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the Zoning Administrator and the City Attorney to seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the Plan Commission shall be furnished to the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor. An appeal from a decision of the Plan Commission under this Section may be taken to the Common Council.

(3) Interpretations. To hear and decide application for interpretations of the zoning regulations and the boundaries of the zoning districts after the Plan Commission has made a review and recommendation.
(4) Substitutions.

(a) Purpose.
(1) A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict adherence to the provisions of this Zoning Code would cause him undue hardship or create conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to a nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning requirements.
(2) The Board of Appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of the Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Code will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of the Zoning Code shall be observed and substantial justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection that the flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
(3) For the purposes of this Section, "unnecessary hardship" shall be defined as an unusual or extreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoning district
Title 13 Floodplain Zoning
25
which is caused by facts, such as rough terrain or good soil conditions, uniquely applicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most or all property in the same zoning district.
(b) Application for Variation. The application for variation shall be filed with the City Clerk. Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected. The application shall contain the following information:
(1) Name and address of applicant and all abutting and opposite property owners of record.
(2) Statement that the applicant is the owner or the authorized agent of the owner of the property.
(3) Address and description of the property.
(4) A site plan showing an accurate depiction of the property.
(5) Additional information required by the Plan Commission, City Engineer, Board of Zoning Appeals or Zoning Administrator.
(c) Public Hearing of Application.
(1) The application shall be referred to the Plan Commission which shall submit a report to the Board of Appeals. The petitioner shall appear before the Plan Commission in order to answer questions.
(2) The Board of Appeals shall conduct at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed variation. Notice of such hearing shall be given not more than thirty (30) days and not less than ten (10) days before the hearing in one (1) or more of the newspapers in general circulation in the City, and shall give due notice to the parties in interest, the Zoning Administrator and the Plan Commission. At the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. The Board shall thereafter reach its decision within thirty (30) days after the final hearing and shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant, Zoning Administrator and Plan Commission.
(d) Action of the Board of Appeals. For the Board to grant a variance, it must find that:
(1) Denial of variation may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographical consideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning Code should be changed.
(2) The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which variation is being sought and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity.
(3) The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the property.
(4) The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
(5) The proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of the Zoning Code.
(e) Conditions. The Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this Section.
SEC. 13-1-194 REVIEW BY COURT OF RECORD.
Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Appeals may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the offices of the Board of Appeals.

ARTICLE A
Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose, Title and General Provisions
SEC. 13-2-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in ss. 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; and the requirements in s. 87.30, Stats.
SEC. 13-2-2 FINDING OF FACT
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
SEC. 13-2-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(1) Protect life, health and property;
(2) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(3) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(4) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(6) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(7) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(8) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and
(9) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
SEC. 13-2-4 TITLE
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Ladysmith, Wisconsin.
SEC. 13-2-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the
Title 13 Floodplain Zoning
36
Letter of Map Change process (see Article H Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Director of Public Works, Ladysmith, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(a) OFFICIAL MAPS : Based on the FIS: 55107CV000B
1. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55107C0484D, 55107C0501D, 55107C0502D, 55107C0503D, 55107C0504D and 55107C0511D, dated March 17, 2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated March 17, 2014; volume number 55107CV000B;
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA
(b) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development.
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN ZONING DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Article H Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Sec. 13-2-62(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article H Amendments.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Article H Amendments.
Title 13 Floodplain Zoning
37
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when
s. 30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23 for cities; s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Rusk County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.
ARTICLE B
General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain Districts
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to
Title 13 Floodplain Zoning
38
minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including
manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance and all other requirements in Sec. 13-2-60(2). Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages.
SEC. 13-2-20 HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC ANALYSES
(1) No floodplain development shall:
(a) Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or
(b) Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost.
(2) The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Article H Amendments are met.
SEC. 13-2-21 WATERCOURSE ALTERATIONS
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The standards of Sec. 13-2-20 must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to Article H Amendments, the community shall apply for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process.
SEC. 13-2-22 CHAPTER 30, 31, WIS. STATS., DEVELOPMENT
Development which requires a permit from the Department, under chs. 30 and 31, Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to Article H Amendments.

71. REGIONAL FLOOD – A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
72. START OF CONSTRUCTION – The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such
Title 13 Floodplain Zoning
62
as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

76. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT – Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
77. UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP – Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.
78. VARIANCE – An authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance.
79. VIOLATION – The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance.

SEC 13-3-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Sections 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 231.81, Wis. Stats.
SEC. 13-3-2 FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
(a) Findings of Fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the City of Ladysmith would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
(1) Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare;
(2) Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
(3) Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters and to maintain storm and flood water capacity;
(4) Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other
fish and aquatic habitat;
(5) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
(6) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities.

General Provisions
SEC. 13-3-10 COMPLIANCE.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the City of Ladysmith shall be in full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see Section 13-3-25 of this Chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this Chapter.
SEC. 13-3-11 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, town and counties are required to comply with this Chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Section 30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies.
SEC. 13-3-12 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
(a) This Chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Section 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this Chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
SEC. 13-3-13 INTERPRETATION.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this Chapter is required by a standard in Chapter NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the Chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this Chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this Chapter.
SEC. 13-3-14 SEVERABILITY.
Should any portion of this Chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected.
SEC. 13-3-15 ANNEXED AREAS.
The Rusk County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the municipality’s official zoning map. The Rusk County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this Section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator.

Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District
SEC. 13-3-20 PURPOSE OF SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING.
This Chapter is adopted to maintain safe and healthful conditions, to prevent and control water pollution, to protect fish spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life and wildlife habitation, to preserve shore cover and natural beauty and to control building and development in wetlands whenever possible. When development is permitted in a wetland, development should occur in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland.
SEC. 13-3-21 OFFICIAL SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING MAPS.
The following maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this Chapter and are on file in the office of the
Clerk-Treasurer:
(a) Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Taps stamped "FINAL" on September 4, 1986.
(b) Zoning map titled Official Zoning Districts, and dated January 14, 1985.
SEC. 13-3-22 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
(a) The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the City of Ladysmith, Wisconsin, which are five (5) acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this Chapter in Section 13-3-21 and which are:
(1) Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City of Ladysmith shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter in Section 13-3-21 of this Chapter.
(2) Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter in Section 13-3-21. Floodplain Zoning Maps shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas in the City.
(b) Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for the final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.
(c) When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If the Department staff concurs with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

Pursuant to the City's Construction Site Erosion Control Chapter (Building Code), the subdivider shall cause all gradings, excavations, open cuts, side slopes, and other land surface disturbances to be mulched, seeded, sodded or otherwise protected so that erosion, siltation, sedimentation and washing are prevented. The subdivider shall submit an erosion control plan that specifies measures that will be taken to assure the minimization of erosion problems.
SEC. 14-1-63 PARTITION FENCES.
When the land included in a subdivision plat or certified map abuts upon or is adjacent to land used for farming or grazing purposes, the subdivider shall erect, keep, and maintain partition fences, satisfying the requirements of the Wisconsin Statutes for a legal and sufficient fence, between such land and the adjacent land. A covenant binding the developer, its grantees, heirs, successors, and assigns to erect and maintain such fences, without cost to the adjoining property owners, so long as the land is used for farming or grazing purposes, shall be included upon the face of the Final Plat or certified survey map.
SEC. 14-1-64 EASEMENTS.
(a) Utility Easements, The Common Council, on the recommendation of appropriate departments and agencies serving the City, shall require utility easements for poles, wire, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and head mains or other utility lines. It is the intent of this Chapter to protect all established easements so as to assure proper grade, assure maintenance of the established grade, prohibit construction of permanent fences or retaining walls over underground installation and prevent the planting of trees in the easement area.
(b) Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream:
(1) There shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this Section; or
(2) The watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be assured and the same provided with a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to comply with this Section.
(3) Wherever possible, it is desirable that drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume flow. In all cases, such
water course shall be of a minimum width established at the high-water mark or, in the absence of such specification, not less than thirty (30) feet. If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the easement will be for a major drainage swale the easement shall be of sufficient width to contain a one hundred (100) year frequency storm. If the drainage easement is located in an established floodway or flood fringe district, the entire floodplain area shall be included within the drainage easement.
Title 14 Subdivision Regulations

In all cases where the requirements of this Chapter are different trom the requirements of Chapter 236, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
(b Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate land and improve streets as provided in this Chapter and Section 14-1-53. Streets shall be located with due regard for topographical conditions, natural features, existing and proposed streets, utilities and land uses and public convenience and safety. Streets shall conform to official maps adopted by the Common Council. The subdivision, certified survey parcel or land division shall be so designed as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street or road.
(c) Compliance with Comprehensive Plan. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to any City Comprehensive Development Plan and to this Chapter and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographical conditions, to run-off of storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation at the same width of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
(d) Areas Not Covered by Official Map. In areas not covered by a City Comprehensive Plan, the layout of streets shall conform to the plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas of the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and officially planned streets, topography and natural terrain, streams and lakes and existing tree growth, public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
(e) Street Classifications. Streets shall be classified as indicated below.
(1) Arterial Streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide through traffic for a heavy volume of vehicles. Arterial streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, shopping areas, recreation areas and points beyond the boundaries of the community.

(3) Dead End. Dead-end alleys are prohibited except under very unusual circumstances, and crooked and 'T' alleys shall be discouraged. Where dead-end alleys are unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.
(h) Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for possible continuation wherever topographic and other physical conditions permit. Provision shall be made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct connection with, or be continuous and in line with, existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets not over five hundred (500) feet in length will be approved when necessitated by the topography.
(i) Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic.
(j) Frontage Roads. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial highway, the Plan Commission may require a frontage road, nonaccess reservation along the rear of the property contiguous to such highway or such other treatment as may be necessary to ensure safe, efficient traffic flow and adequate protection of residential properties.
(k) Private Streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall public improvements be approved for any private street; all streets shall be dedicated for public use.
(1) Visibility. Streets shall afford maximum visibility and safety and shall intersect at right angles where practicable. As required by the City Engineer, sufficient vision clearance triangles shall be provided at intersections.

SEC. 15-2-7 CONTROL OF EROSION AND POLLUTANT'S DURING LAND DISTURBANCE AND DEVELOPMENT.
(a) Applicability. This Section applies to the following sites of land development or land disturbing activities:
(1) Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction of houses or commercial, industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys.
(2) Those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of houses or commercial, industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys.

574
NOTE: The above applicability criteria are specifically stated in 1983 Wisconsin Act 416 for inclusion in this Chapter. Utility companies responsible for energy repair work should enter into a "memorandum of agreement" with the Building Inspector clearly stating their responsibilities if their activities may be included under any of the above applicability criteria.
(b) Erosion and Other Pollutant Control Requirements. The following requirements shall be met on all sites described in Subsection (a).
(1) Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, up-slope chambers, hydrocyclones, swirl concentrators, or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of one hundred (100) microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate. If the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than one hundred (100) microns during dewatering operations, then no control is needed before discharge, except as determined by the Building Inspector. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels.
NOTE: There are several ways to meet this particle size performance objective, depending on the pumping rate. As an example, if the pumping rate is very low (1 gal/min), then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe (about 8" in diameter for 1 gal/min) several feet long would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of one hundred (100) micron, and larger, particles. As the pumping rate increases, then the "device" must be enlarged. At a moderate (100 gal/min) pumping rate, a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe, or concrete pipe section, or other small "tank" (about 4-1/2 feet across for a 100 gal/min pumping rate) several feet tall would be adequate. With these pipe sections or small tanks, inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence. With very large pumping rates (10,000 gal/min), sediment basins (about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10,000 gal/min) at least three (3) feet in depth with a simple (but
adequately sized) pipe outlet would be needed. More sophisticated control devices (such as swirl concentrators or hydro-cyclones) could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above, but they would not be required.
(2) Waste and Material Disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
(3) Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
(4) Drain Inlet Protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale, filter fabric, or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards and specifications.
(5) Site Erosion Control. The following criteria apply only to land development or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site:
a. Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described below in Subsection (b)(5)c.3. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 0.5 ft/sec across the disturbed area for the set of one (1) year design storms. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels.
NOTE: Soil and Conservation Service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of channels should be followed.
b. All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
c. Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either of the following:
1. All disturbed ground left inactive for seven (7) or more days shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding (only available prior to September l5th) or by mulching or covering, or other equivalent control measure.
575
2. For sites with more than ten (10) acres disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one (1%) percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three (3) feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three (3) feet. The basin shall be designed to trap sediment greater than fifteen (15) microns in size, based on the set of one (1) year design storms having durations from 0.5 to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water.
3. For sites with less than ten (10) acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.
d. Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of material should not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for more than seven (7) days, they shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than seven (7) days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile. In-street utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than twenty-five (25) feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control if exposed for more than seven (7) days, and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bales or other appropriate filtering barriers.

ANTIDISPLACEMENT, RELOCATION ASSISTANCE, AND
DISPLACEMENT MINIMIZATION PLAN
(a) Federal Act Funding.

(b) Replacement Housing. All replacement housing will be provided within three (3) years after the commencement of the demolition or conversion. Before entering into a contract committing the City of Ladysmith to provide funds for an activity that will directly result in such demolition or conversion, the City of Ladysmith will make public and submit to the Wisconsin Department of Administration the following information in writing:
(1) A description of the proposed assisted activity;
(2) The location on a map and number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be demolished or converted to a use other than as low/moderate income dwelling units as a direct result of the assisted activities;
(3) A time schedule for the commencement and completion of the demolition or conversions;
(4) The location on a map and the number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be provided as replacement dwelling units. If such data are not available at the time of the general submission, the City of Ladysmith will identify the general location on an area map and the approximate number of dwelling units by size and provide information identifying the specific location and number of dwelling units by size as soon as it is available;
(5) The source of funding and a time schedule for the provision of replacement dwelling units;
(6) The basis for concluding that each replacement dwelling unit will remain a low/moderate income dwelling unit for at least ten (10) years from the date of initial occupancy;
(7) Information demonstrating that nay proposed replacement of dwelling units with smaller dwelling units (e.g., a two-bedroom unit with two one-bedroom units) is consistent with the housing needs of low and moderate income households in the jurisdiction.
(c) Exceptions. The City of Ladysmith may request the Wisconsin Department of Administration to recommend that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development approve an exception to required replacement housing if there is an adequate local supply of vacant low/moderate income dwelling units in standard condition. Exceptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
(d) Relocation Assistance. The City of Ladysmith will provide relocation assistance to any lower income person displaced by demolition of any dwelling unit or the lower conversion of a low/moderate income dwelling unit to another use in connection with an assisted activity.
(e) Steps to Minimize Displacement. Consistent with the goals and objectives of activities assisted under the Act, the City of Ladysmith will take the following steps to minimize the displacement of persons from their homes:
(1) No rehabilitation construction activities will be undertaken that will cause permanent displacement as a result of these activities.
(2) Any construction activities that may cause temporary displacement will be coordinated so that disruption of living accommodations is minimized
(3) Demolition of existing structures will occur only under the following conditions:
a. That the structure has been identified as blighted and a hazard to the surrounding community.
b. That the structure has been unoccupied for a minimum of one (1) year.
c. That the cost of rehabilitation of the structure to a reasonable decent, safe and sanitary condition exceeds the fair market value of that structure.
(f) Definitions. Definitions for the purposes of this plan are as follows:
Title 15 Grievances Regarding Access to Public Buildings by Handicapped Persons
584
(1) Low/Moderate Income Dwelling Unit. A unit with a market rent, including utility costs, that does not exceed the applicable fair market rent for existing housing and moderate rehabilitation, as established under the Section 8 existing housing program.
(2) Vacant Occupiable Dwelling Unit. A vacant unit that is in standard condition; or in substandard condition, suitable for rehabilitation; or in dilapidated condition and occupied less than a year from the date of the grantee agreement.
(3) Occupiable Dwelling Unit. A unit that is in standard condition or has been raised to a standard condition from a substandard condition, suitable for rehabilitation.
(4) Standard Occupiable Dwelling Unit. A well built unit with adequate space for persons living there. There are no major defects in the structure and only minor maintenance is required. Such dwelling will have the following characteristics: reliable roofs; sound walls and foundations; adequate and stable floors, walls and ceilings; surfaces and woodwork that are not seriously damaged nor have paint deterioration; sound windows and doors; adequate heating, plumbing, and electrical systems which do not present safety hazards; adequate insulation for local climatic conditions; and is in compliance with local building and housing codes.
(5) Substandard Condition Dwelling Unit, Suitable for Rehabilitation. A dwelling unit which will show a lot of deferred maintenance with damage to structural items. Conditions contributing to substandard dwelling units include but are not limited to sagging, cracked, rotting or leaking roofs, walls, foundations, ceilings, floors, doors, and windows; deteriorated surfaces and woodwork; unreliable heating, plumbing, or electrical systems which present safety hazards or inadequate insulation. The cost of rehabilitating the unit should be determined as economically feasible.
(g) Community Development Block Grant Participation. The City of Ladysmith anticipates participating in the Wisconsin Small Cities Community Development Block Grant Program. Through this participation, single family housing rehabilitation will occur. The consequences of the rehabilitation activities is that the potential of displacement exists. The purpose of the displacement minimization plan is to mitigate the adverse effects of displacement on low to moderate income persons and families, as well as businesses.
(h) Temporary Displacement.
(1) Rehabilitation project activities shall be performed in a manner which will minimize owner inconvenience. Utility shut-offs should occur during standard work hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), where the installation of fixtures can be concluded in a short period of one to two working days. Some activities may require a longer period of time, three to five working days.
(2) Property owners will be required to notify all affected tenants as to the extent, timing and duration of the proposed rehabilitation activities to be undertaken. If temporary displacement of tenants is possible, the property owner must refer the tenants to the City for assistance.
(3) Applicants for rental rehabilitation funds shall be expected to mitigate effects of indirect displacement by attempting to achieve a mutually agreeable displacement policy with tenants. The City of Ladysmith shall ensure that a mutually agreeable displacement plan between the owner and the tenant has been reached prior to the start of the rehabilitation effort.
(4) When temporary displacement if required, the property owner will be required to rebate to the tenant the pro-rata share of rent paid for the period that the unit will be uninhabitable. The tenant will then have the option of making arrangements for temporary housing during this period and keeping the rent rebate, or the tenant may elect to move into a local motel, hotel, or rooming house. Should the cost of the housing unit exceed the pro-rata share of rental rebate, the excess costs would be monitored by the City and the responsibility for the costs shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(5) The property owner will be responsible for providing storage space for the tenant's household goods and furnishings during the rehabilitation work, if necessary.
(i) Permanent Displacement.
Title 15 Grievances Regarding Access to Public Buildings by Handicapped Persons
585
(1) No permanent displacement will occur as a result of the rehabilitation activities. If permanent displacement should occur the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 shall have to be utilized. Such displacement may occur if a combination residential commercial property is rehabilitated by a private entity and is no longer utilized as a residential property.
(2) The City of Ladysmith shall provide information and referral services to tenants who are displaced by a rehabilitation effort.
(3) When temporary displacement is determined to be necessary and the tenant elects to make a permanent move rather than retain tenancy in the rehabilitated unit, the City will compensate the tenant in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Act for expenses incurred as a result of the move.
(4) If the rehabilitation activities result in the loss of residential units, those residential rental units that rent below the fair market rent under the HUD Section 8 Existing Housing Program will be replaced. Low to moderate income tenants will be entitled to replacement housing assistance payments for a five (5) year period. Other tenants will be entitled to assistance payments under the Uniform Relocation Act.
(5) If displacement occurs due to acquisition, demolition, or rehabilitation efforts, the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 shall be utilized. Displaced residents will be eligible for relocation in accordance with the Uniform Act. Uniform Act technical assistance was provided by Community Development Staff. If displacement occurs, the City will request additional technical assistance to ensure that all acquisitions/ displacements are properly conducted.

by Handicapped Persons
15-4-1 Grievance Procedures Regarding Access to Public Buildings
by Handicapped Persons.
SEC. 15-4-1 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING ACCESS TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS
BY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.
(a) Statement of Purpose. The. City of Ladysmith is committed to providing adequate access by handicapped or visually impaired persons to public buildings financed in part by federal revenue sharing. This Section provides for a grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office of Revenue Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55[d][2]) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 V.S.C. 794); Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance
(b) Complaint Procedure.
(1) Complaints should be filed with the City Administrator, who has been designated to coordinate Section 504 Compliance.
(2) A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
(3) A complaint should be filed within thirty (30) days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.)
(4) An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint. The investigation will be conducted by an appropriate person designated by the City Administrator who should review the handicapped Requirements Handbook published by the Federal Programs Advisory Service.
(5) A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the designated person and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than thirty (30) days after its filing.
(6) The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the City relating to the complaints filed.

Title 15 Grievances Regarding Access to Public Buildings by Handicapped Persons
594

INDEX TO CODE
(References are to section numbers)
USE OF INDEX: This index is designed for user ease. To locate information found in the code, formulate a specific question. The key words in that question then become guides for using the index. In the event you do not locate the desired information on your first attempt, the following checklist may help.
(1) Cross references (when needed) are always located at the beginning of entries. Have you overlooked any?
(2) Frequently, initial questions are too general. Reformulating a more specific question may help.
(3) Information on officials can be found two ways. The entry for an official's name contains general duties as well as conditions of his office, such as compensation and tenure. Duties assigned to him by ordinances on specific subjects will be found under those subjects.
(4) Definitions can be located under the "DEFINITIONS" main heading or in specific subject areas through the subheading "Definitions of terms."
