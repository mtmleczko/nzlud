(b)  Records will be available for inspection and copying during all regular office hours.

(d)  A requester shall be permitted to use facilities comparable to those available to City employees to inspect, copy or abstract a record. 
(e)  The legal custodian may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged. 
(f)  A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows: 
1.  The cost of photocopying shall be $0.25 per page. Such cost has been calculated not to exceed the actual, necessary and direct cost of reproduction. 
2.  If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged. 
3.  The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper, such as films, computer printouts and audiotapes or videotapes, shall be charged. 
4.  If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged. 
5.  There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds $50.00, in which case the actual cost shall be determined by the legal custodian and billed to the requester. Cost for locating a record shall be determined by the actual hourly wage (including fringe benefits) of the employee searching for the record, multiplied by the amount of time spent in the search.

(g)  Pursuant to §19.34, Wis. Stats., and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which, the legal custodian from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of records and the costs thereof. Each authority shall also prominently display at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a copy of subsections (4) through (6) of this section. This subsection does not apply to members of the City Council. 
(5)  ACCESS PROCEDURES. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under §19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under subsection (4)(f)6. A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in subsection (6). If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within 5 business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under §19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney. 
(6)  LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS. 
(a)  As provided by §19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt from inspection under this section: 
1.  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by State or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by State law. 
2.  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the State. 
3.  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection. 
4.  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(b)  As provided by §43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section. 
(c)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
2.  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing. 
3.  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a City officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
4.  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
5.  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of City property, investing of City funds or other City business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
6.  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data. 
7.  Communications between legal counsel for the City and any officer, agent or employee of the City, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the City or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under §905.03, Wis. Stats. 
(d)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

8.11 - STORM SEWER ASSESSMENT. (Cr. Ord. #43-80) 
(1)  PURPOSE. The purpose of the section is to establish a general storm sewer assessment policy for the City. All new subdivisions shall be an exception to the policy and shall be governed by the requirements of Chapter 18 of this Municipal Code. 
(2)  PROCEDURE. 
(a)  Cost . When the Council determines that a storm sewer is necessary in order to adequately serve a limited and determined area with proper drainage, the cost of such storm sewer shall be assessed against the properties benefited using the City's police power to levy special assessments in accordance with §66.60, Wis. Stats. All properties shall pay their proportionate share of the total cost of the storm sewer project. 
(b)  Assessment . All properties which are benefited by the installation of such storm sewer shall be assessed. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an assessment being charged against any property lying outside the area where the storm sewer is placed provided a benefit to those lands outside the area is found to exist. 
(3)  METHOD OF ASSESSMENT. The assessment for each parcel of land benefited shall be based on the area of the lot within the drainage area. An assessment rate per acre shall be determined by dividing the assessable total cost of the storm sewer system by the total area of the drainage area. The assessable cost shall be determined by deducting the cost of intersections, which shall include the sewer main, manholes, catch basins and laterals and the difference in pipe cost between 18 inch diameter storm sewer and larger sizes required from the total storm sewer costs. The amount assessed shall not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the storm sewer system. 
(4)  PAYMENT. All properties assessed shall be allowed to pay any assessment charged in cash within 30 days after receipt of the final bill. Thereafter interest at a per annum rate to be determined by the Council shall be charged until the assessment is paid or the assessment may be paid in 5 equal annual installments with interest at the per annum rate as established above on the unpaid balance. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the Council granting an extension of time for such assessment payments beyond the 5-year period if in their opinion they deem it to be in the best interests of the City.

b.  No animal may be declared vicious if death, injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal which, at the time such was sustained was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the animal.

b.  Off Premises of Owner. While off the owner's or caretaker's premises, the vicious animal must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial chain or leash not exceeding 4 feet in length and under the control of a responsible person. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will not cause injury to the animal or interfere with its vision or respiration, but must prevent it from biting any person or animal. 
c.  Warning Signs. All owners or caretakers of vicious animals shall display, in prominent places on their premises, near all entrances to the premises, signs in letters of not less than 2 inches high using the words "Warning-Vicious Animal." A similar sign is required to be posted on the kennel or pen of the animal.

No person may sell or transfer possession of a vicious animal to another person without first notifying the Police Department in writing at least 3 days in advance of the sale or transfer of possession. 
6.  Impoundment and Destruction of Animal Injuring Humans.

Registration shall be accomplished on or before September 1, 2002. Wolf-dog hybrids permitted in the City shall be confined as set forth in this ordinance.

If said animal has not been so removed within 48 hours of the service of the citation, the said animal may be impounded as directed by the City Police Department until the trial on the citation. In that case the owner of any such animal shall pay all expenses incurred due to such impoundment, including but not limited to, the cost of shelter, food, handling and veterinary care. If it is determined by plea or trial that said animal is a wolf-dog hybrid not registered pursuant to §12.03(7B) on or before September 1, 2002, it shall be removed from and not returned to the City. 
(d)  [ Confinement Required .] The owner of any wolf-dog hybrid permitted to be kept in the City, and the owner of any property on which such wolf-dog hybrid is kept, shall see that the animal is at all times confined according to the minimum requirements of this subsection.

An exception may be granted by the Building Inspector if the lot is substandard in area (per the zoning code), in which case the Building Inspector may modify the required square footage of the enclosure; provided, however, that it be of a size adequate to protect the animals confined against weather extremes and still provides for the well-being of the animals. 
2.  The enclosure shall extend to a height of not less than 8 feet and shall be surrounded from ground level to a height of 4 feet by one-quarter inch galvanized mesh screening.

The inspection fee shall be $50.00. The inspector shall file a report with the Common Council to the adequacy of the enclosure to protect the safety of the public and provide for the well being of the animal. The Common Council shall review the report and if the Common Council is satisfied that the owner has provided a secure enclosure that is adequate for the protection of the public and the well being of the animal, it may issue a written exemption from the terms of subsection (e) above. Such exemption shall be valid for the animal's lifetime; provided, however, that a conviction of the owner for allowing the animal to run at large in violation of this section shall void such exemption. In issuing exemptions, the Common Council shall consider the size and observed behavior of the animal and any prior convictions of the owner for allowing any animal to run at large. The Common Council may require modifications to be made to existing enclosures as a condition of issuing an exemption.

Ill. 2006) and other cases, as well as findings from papers, articles, studies and information from other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council's findings include the following: 
1.  That the foregoing cases, studies, reports and other material are reasonably believed to be relevant to the problems that the City of Oconomowoc is seeking to abate and prevent in the future. 
2.  Sexually oriented businesses are associated with a wide variety of harmful secondary effects which include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Illicit drug use, illicit and unsanitary sexual activity including prostitution and other unlawful sex-related offenses, as well as other personal and property crimes and offenses; 
b.  Decreased desirability of and depreciation of property values in surrounding neighborhoods and properties; 
c.  Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and 
d.  The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct. 
3.  Alcohol consumption on the premises of a sexually oriented business exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of such businesses on the community, including illegal drug use and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
4.  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that may be uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. 
5.  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
6.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, including those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
7.  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
8.  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
9.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
10.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses. 
11.  Sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, including increased crime and the downgrading of property values. 
12.  Sexually oriented businesses in which live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the governing body believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City. 
13.  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
14.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
15.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres. 
16.  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this section. 
17.  The findings noted in paragraphs 1. through 16. raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(c)  Determinations . Therefore, the Common Council has determined that sexually oriented businesses should be regulated in order to promote the goal of addressing the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses and that the City has a substantial government interest in regulating such businesses.

(b)  Effective Date . The provisions of subsection (a) above shall become effective on the 1st day of August, 2009. 
13.50 - SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. 
(1)  GENERAL 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the Sewerage System Utility to establish sewer service charges in such amount as to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the following costs: 
1.  operation and maintenance including contributions to a replacement fund, and 
2.  debt service including debt service reserves and coverage requirements. 
(b)  Those aspects of sewerage service charges relating to operation, maintenance and replacement fund shall be in accord with any relevant and applicable requirements imposed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources or by federal law. 
(c)  The Utility may establish sewer service charges including sewer use charges, annual connection charges, septage charges, ready-to-serve charges, sewer availability charges, charges to extraterritorial users and other charges as deemed necessary by the Common Council so as to assure that each user of the sewerage system pays its proportionate share of the cost of the facilities. 
(d)  A review of the user charge system shall be conducted on an annual basis. This review shall include an analysis of the total costs of the system and of wastewater contribution of users and user classes. The sewer service charges shall be computed annually by the Finance Director and shall be furnished to the Common Council in time to provide for the implementation of new charges on January 1 of the following year. (Am. #00-0473) 
(e)  The charges established hereunder may be developed using a utility ratemaking method which would include recovery of operation and maintenance costs plus depreciation and a return on investment. 
(2)  SEWER USE CHARGE. 
(a)  A sewer use charge is hereby imposed upon all users of the sewer system. The sewer use charge will recover the component of total operation, maintenance and capital costs of the sewerage system which relates to sewage flow attributable to users of the system. The sewer use charge shall be based upon the cost of treating flow, BOD and suspended solids at the strength of domestic wastewater. The sewer use charge shall consist of a volumetric charge in terms of dollars per thousand gallons ($/1,000 gals.). The basis for billing sewer use charges shall be metered water usage. For users assigned a residential equivalent connection (REC), as defined in §§13.57 and 13.62, the REC shall be the basis for the sewer use charge. 
(b)  If any user of the sewer system procures any part or all of his/her water from sources other than the Water Utility, the user shall furnish, install and maintain at his or her expense water meters of a type approved by the Water Utility for the purpose of determining the volume of sewage discharged to the sewer system as described in §13.57. At the discretion of the City, a user procuring water from other sources than the Water Utility may be assigned a residential equivalent connection (REC) to be used as a basis for the sewer use charge as determined from §13.62. If in the opinion of the Operations Manager the information in §13.62 does not accurately reflect the user's wastewater discharge to the sewerage system, then the Operations Manager may assign a REC to the user. The user charge for nonmetered users shall be based upon an estimated usage equivalent to the number of assigned REC's multiplied by the average annual residential sewer usage. (Am. #10-O781) 
(c)  The residential water consumption for sprinkling as determined by the Water Utility and any water credit meters for any refrigeration, air conditioning system or industrial cooling water not entering the sewer system shall not be used in computing the sewer use charge. 
(d)  Irrigation Allowance for Residential Users . (Rep. & recr. #00-0473) The metered residential water use shall be adjusted to account for consumptive water use during the summer months of May, June, July, August and September. The volume used as the basis for the sewer service charge for those months shall be the water volume read by the City, with the maximum limitation that the volume in either May, June, July, August or September shall not exceed the average volume used for the preceding January, February and March provided the charges for each of said months are based on a full month's usage. In the event the current user is a customer without service or billing during either of the months of January, February or March, the base volume for the month for which there was no service or billing for comparison purposes shall be 7,000 gallons. 
(e)  Certain industrial and commercial users which generate waste at a strength greater than domestic wastewater, and with BOD and suspended solids loadings at or less than 350 mg/l each, shall be classified as Class B Commercial/Industrial Users. The sewer use charge for Class B users shall be based upon the cost of treating flow, BOD and suspended solids at a strength of 350 mg/l for BOD and 350 mg/l for suspended solids. 
(3)  ANNUAL CONNECTION CHARGE. An annual connection charge is hereby imposed upon each user connected to the sewerage system. The annual connection charge shall recover costs related to wastewater treatment flow not directly attributable to users (infiltration/inflow) and customer costs (including accounting and billing). The annual connection charge shall be levied to each lateral connection to the sewerage system and will consist of a flat fee per connection. 
(4)  SURCHARGES FOR CERTAIN INDUSTRIAL USERS. A surcharge shall be levied on all users of the system, excepting for Class B users, who discharge wastes which have concentrations of BOD or suspended solids greater than domestic wastewater. The surcharge shall apply to any additional loadings over and above that which would be generated on wastes at a strength equal to domestic wastewater. The volume of flow used for computing waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption or the actual volume of waste as determined by a sampling and metering manhole or a discharge monitoring station. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing BOD, and suspended solids. The surcharge in a given period shall be computed on the basis of the following formula: 
Surcharge B = [(B-250)* .00834*Vu] * Bc 
Surcharge S = [(S-270)* .00834*Vu] * Sc 
Surcharge B = Surcharge for BOD 
Surcharge S = Surcharge for suspended solids 
Bc = Costs for treatment of a unit (lb.) of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). 
B = Concentration of BOD (mg/l). 
Sc = Costs for treatment of a unit (lb.) of suspended solids 
S = Concentration of suspended solids (mg/l) 
Vu = Billable flow volume in thousands of gallons. 
(5)  READY-TO-SERVE CHARGE. A ready-to-serve charge shall be imposed on each premises to which sewer service has been made available by the City and a connection to the system for service has not been made. The ready-to-serve charge shall be based upon the charges provided in subsection (3). Any ready-to-serve charge becoming effective during a given year shall be charged on a pro rata basis for that year in which such charge becomes effective. This charge shall begin from date of notice by the City that the facility is ready to connect and be served by the system. As provided by §13.49(2), connection shall be made to the public sewer within 12 months. 
(6)  SEPTAGE CHARGE. 
(a)  Charges shall be imposed for septage treatment and disposal. Charges for septage discharges shall be based on flow, BOD, TSS and such other constituents which affect the cost of treatment and disposal. The volume of flow used for computing the septage charge will be the volume of septage discharged. All persons discharging septage which has concentrations greater than domestic wastewater as defined in §13.48 of this chapter shall be subject to a surcharge. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City for removing BOD, TSS and other pertinent constituents. The surcharge shall be computed in the same manner as described in subsection (4) of this section. 
(b)  The following waste strength parameters shall serve as the basis for computing the surcharge to be applied, unless the septage discharge is sampled and analyzed: 
Septic Tank Holding Tank BOD 5,000 mg/l 350 mg/l TSS 11,000 mg/l 500 mg/l  
(c)  All costs associated with administering the discharge of septage to the WTF, sample collection, laboratory analysis and billing will be paid by the septage hauler. 
(d)  On an annual basis, the Operations Manager shall, in conjunction with determining sewer service charges, determine the septage charge and related fees and submit recommendations to the Common Council. The Council shall establish the charges and fees by resolution. (Am. #10-O781) 
(7)  SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGE. See §13.63 of this chapter. A sewer availability charge shall be collected by the City from all new connections to the sewerage system or existing connections which have a change in operations or activity which results in utilization of additional sewerage system capacity. This charge shall be calculated and collected as provided in §13.63 of this chapter. No sewer availability charge shall be levied to those users who previously shared a common lateral. This charge shall be paid at a time a plumbing or building permit is issued. 
(8)  SPECIAL RATES. It is understood that the approving authority may at any time hereafter set special rates for any large commercial service, industrial use, extraterritorial areas, contract users or any other unique user that does not readily fit into other categories of users. Any user discharging any toxic pollutants, wastewater or other wastes to the sewage system shall pay for the increased operation, maintenance and replacement costs caused by their discharge. 
(9)  EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICES. 
(a)  Municipal sanitary sewer service may be provided to extraterritorial locations on request. Such service may require municipal ownership of the interceptor and collection system, excluding laterals and shall require compliance with City policy pertaining to annexation. 
(b)  Pursuant to §§66.076(8) and 66.069(2)(c), Wis. Stats., sanitary sewer service in the Village of Lac LaBelle or unincorporated areas shall be limited to the boundaries of the sewer service areas of the Ixonia Sanitary District #2, Mary Lane Sanitary District and Blackhawk Sanitary District as established on January 1, 1989. Unless enlarged by subsequent ordinances, the City shall have no obligation to serve beyond the areas so delineated. 
(c)  Except where negotiated and approved by the Common Council, the City shall not be held financially responsible for planning, design or construction costs of the extraterritorial sewer system. 
(d)  Extraterritorial sewer recipients shall pay sewer user charges as established in an intermunicipal agreement (§66.30 Wis. Stats.) 
13.51 - ANNUAL BUDGET AND METHOD OF PAYMENT OF CHARGES. 
(1)  BUDGET TO BE PREPARED. On an annual basis, the City Administrator shall prepare a Sewer System Utility budget. The budgeted expenditures shall be incorporated into the rate review per §13.51(1)(d). The budgeted revenues shall be sufficient to cover projected operation, maintenance and debt service costs of the sewerage utility. 
(2)  SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. (Am. #00-0477(A)) Sewer service charges shall be for the corresponding period of the water bills and shall be payable to the City Treasurer. Statements for such charges and assessments levied and assessed in accordance with this subchapter shall become due and payable within 20 days after the end of each period. A penalty of 1 percent per month shall be added to all bills not paid by the date fixed for final payment. 
(3)  BILLING. The property owner is held responsible for all sewer bills on premises that he or she owns. All sewer bills and notices of any nature relative to the sewer service will be addressed to the owner and/or occupant and delivered to the addressee by bulk mail. 
(4)  FAILURE TO RECEIVE BILL, NO PENALTY EXEMPTION. Every reasonable care will be exercised in the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a sewer bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for payment of sewer charges within the prescribed period nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof. 
(5)  DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS. (Rep. & recr. #96-0378) 
(a)  Authority . The Common Council of the City of Oconomowoc adopts §66.076(7), Wis. Stats., by reference. 
(b)  Procedure . 
1.  The Operations Manager shall inform the City Treasurer before October 15 of each year of all lots or parcels for which sewer charges are still owed for service supplied in the year preceding October 1. (Am. #10-O781) 
2.

(Am. #15-O880; #16-O905; #17-O926) 
2.  Review. The sewer availability charge imposed by this section may be increased annually based upon the prior year's Construction Cost Index. 
(b)  Residential/Nonresidential - 3-Inch Meter or Larger . 
1.  Residential/nonresidential connections with a meter size of 3 inches or greater shall be calculated using the estimated water usage supplied by the owner/developer on the appropriate city form divided by the appropriate annualized gallons applicable (definitions in Chapter 27, §27.04(16)(a), (b), and (c)) to each of the fees in the ordinance to arrive at the number of residential equivalent connections (RECs), and then multiplying the RECs times the appropriate fees in force at the time of calculation. 
a.  The property owner shall submit on forms provided by the City a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for the nonresidential development. 
b.  Based upon the information supplied by the property owner under subsection a., the City shall calculate the number of RECs for that development by dividing the intended water use by the annualized amount as defined in definitions in Chapter 27, §27.04(16)(a), (b), and (c). All REC calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC. An interim fee shall be calculated by multiplying the calculated RECs by the fee schedule in Table 1 above. 
c.  Since the impact fee determined under subsections a. and b. above is based upon estimated intended usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for any 12-month period. At any time between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of the nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to determine the highest actual recorded usage in any 12-month period. 
d.  Based upon the information obtained under subsection c., the City shall recalculate the number of RECs and may recalculate the impact fee. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the original charge, the difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made by the current owner of the property. If reviewed pursuant to subsection (b)1.c., above, the calculations and billing shall be accomplished within 6 months of the end of the third year. 
(c)  Redevelopment and/or Increase in Use . 
1.  Residential/Nonresidential Development - 2-Inch Meter Size or Less. Where redevelopment does not require an increase in the size of the meter, there will be no charge. Should the redevelopment or increase in use of an existing user require an increase in the size of the meter, the charge due would be the difference between the existing meter size and the required meter size as proposed for the development in Table 1. 
2.  Residential/Nonresidential Development - Meter Sizes 3-Inch and Larger. 
a.  The property owner shall submit, on forms provided by the City, a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for the residential/nonresidential redevelopment. Existing meter size equivalent flow for the current meter size in use up to 2 inches of the redevelopment site should then be deducted from the proposed intended usage to arrive at the basis for recalculation. If the current meter is 3 inches or larger, the existing use to be deducted shall be based on annual use history. 
b.  Based upon the information supplied by the property owner under subsection a., the City shall calculate the number of residential equivalent connections for that redevelopment by dividing the intended water use by the annualized amount as defined in definitions in Chapter 27, §27.04(16)(a), (b), and (c). All REC calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC. An interim fee shall be calculated by multiplying the calculated RECs by the fee schedule as in Table 1 above. 
c.  Since the impact fee determined under subsections a. and b. is based upon estimated intended usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for any 12-month period. At any time between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of the nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to determine the highest actual recorded usage in any 12-month period. 
d.  Based upon the information obtained under subsection c., the City shall recalculate the number of RECs and may recalculate the impact fee pursuant to subsection (c)2.b., above. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the original charge, the difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made by the current owner of the property/development. If reviewed pursuant to subsection (b)1.c., above, the calculations and billing shall be accomplished within 6 months of the end of the third year. 
(d)  Unmetered Residential . For unmetered users of the sewerage system, the following table shall be used to determine the residential equivalent connection (REC) or estimated gallons of wastewater discharged to the sewerage system, except as provided in §13.57: 
TABLE 2 
Residential Users REC Condominium 1.00 Single-family home 1.00 Duplex 2.00 Multiple-family (2 bedrooms) 1.00/unit Multiple-family (1 bedroom or less) 0.75/unit Multiple-family (1 and 2 bedrooms) affordable independent senior housing (§42 and similar program qualified) 0.50/unit  
(e)  Unmetered Commercial/Industrial . For unmetered commercial and industrial users of the sewerage system, their wastewater flow shall be determined from the following table unless the Operations Manager determines that the information in the table does not accurately reflect the user's wastewater discharge to the sewerage system, in which case the Operations Manager will assign a wastewater flow to the user. The RECs may be determined by dividing the wastewater flow obtained from the table by the flow of the average residential user. The minimum RECs for any account shall not be less than 1.00 REC. Upon completion of the REC computations, all RECs will be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC.

(4)  COLLECTION OF SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGES. Sewer availability charges calculated and due pursuant to this section shall be paid at the time a plumbing or building permit is issued. 
(5)  DISPOSITION OF SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGES. All charges collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in an appropriate segregated fund. The charges collected pursuant to this section shall be restricted solely and exclusively for financing or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness related to capital improvements of the sewer utility system. Interest earned by the fund shall be credited to the fund and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for the fund. 
13.63 - SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGE ADMINISTRATION. 
(1)  DEFINED. See §§13.48 and 13.50(7) of this chapter. 
(2)  ESTABLISHED. A sewer availability charge is hereby established for connections to the City sewerage system, including extraterritorial areas served. The sewer availability charge shall recover the historic cost existing customers have contributed to the Sewer Utility's infrastructure and loss of interest thereon. The sewer availability charge shall be based upon the user's potential needed capacity in the sewerage system. The schedule of sewer availability charges shall be as set forth below. 
(3)  SCHEDULE OF SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGES. 
(a)  Residential Development . (Am. #99-0441; #99-0443; #99-0457; #00-0487; #01-0517; #02-0546; #03-0582; #04-O614; #05-O645; #06-O680; #07-O714; #08-O734) 
1.  Basic sewer availability charge for each residential equivalent connection ..... $3,429.00 
2.  Credits to be deducted from basic sewer availability charge: 
Extraterritorial user, including annexed and attached property ..... No Credit 
Existing unconnected single-family residence within the City limits as of June 30, 1991 ..... $1,794.00 
Existing vacant lot platted on or before June 30, 1991 ..... $552.00 
(b)  Nonresidential Development . 
1.  The property owner shall submit on forms provided by the City a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for any nonresidential development. 
2.  Based on the information supplied by the property owner, the City shall calculate the number of residential equivalent connections for that development using the method set forth in §13.62 and shall calculate and impose an interim sewer availability charge according to the schedule set forth in §13.63(3)(a). All REC calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC. A minimum fee based upon one REC shall be established for all nonresidential connections. 
3.  Since the charge determined under subpars. 1. and 2. above is based upon estimated intended usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for a 12-month period. At any time between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of the nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to determine the highest actual recorded usage in a 12-month period. 
4.  Based upon the information obtained under subpar. 3., the City shall recalculate the number of Residential Equivalent Connections, and may recalculate the charge pursuant to subsection (3)(b)2. above. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the original charge, the difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made. There will be no refund notwithstanding the result of the recalculation. 
(c)  Connected Properties . Each existing property connected to the Sewerage System that has a change in operations or activity which results in the utilization of additional sewerage system capacity will be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, to determine the imposition of a sewer availability charge. The charge shall be based upon the estimated annual usage for the customer operating on the premises reduced by a credit for sewer system capital charges paid through prior sewer availability or sewer user charges. The following methodology shall be incorporated into a determination of sewer availability charges for properties previously connected to the sewerage system where a change in operations or activity takes place. 
1.  An estimate shall be made of projected future annual usage, in terms of RECs, for the customer as in §13.63(3)(b) above. 
2.  The City shall determine if a previous sewer availability charge has been imposed on the property. If a prior charge has been paid, the number of RECs determined in §13.63(3)(c)1. shall be reduced by the total number of RECs on which the previous charge was based. The net number of incremental RECs shall be the basis for the sewer availability charge computation. 
3.  If the property was developed prior to the inception of the sewer availability charge and no sewer availability charge was paid for the subject property, then a credit shall be given based upon the estimated sewer system capital charges previously paid. The estimated contribution toward system capital cost shall be based upon historical sewer usage. The most recent 2-year period for which the property had operating activity shall serve as the basis for the credit. The average annual usage in terms of RECs during this period shall be deducted from the number of RECs computed according to §13.63(3)(c)1., to yield the net number of incremental RECs subject to the sewer availability charge. 
4.  The net incremental RECs calculated in §13.63(3)(c)2. or 3. shall be multiplied by the charge in §13.63(3)(a)1., to determine the sewer availability charge. 
(4)  COLLECTION OF SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGES. Sewer availability charges calculated and due pursuant to this section shall be paid at the time a plumbing or building permit is issued. 
(5)  DISPOSITION OF SEWER AVAILABILITY CHARGES. All charges collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in an appropriate segregated fund. The charges collected pursuant to this section shall be restricted solely and exclusively for financing or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness related to capital improvements of the Sewer Utility System. Interest earned by the fund shall be credited to the fund and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for the fund. 
(6)  REVIEW. The sewer availability charge imposed by this section shall be adjusted annually for inflation. 
13.65 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES. 
(1)  Any person who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this subchapter or with an order of the City issued pursuant to this subchapter or shall tamper with metering or sampling shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by such violation, including reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation and, upon conviction of any violation of this subchapter, shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $100.00 nor more than $2,500.00 per violation, plus damages. Each day a condition is allowed to exist which is contrary to all or any part of this subchapter shall constitute a new violation. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises delinquent under the provisions of this subchapter shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating charges due and penalties for violations. 
(2)  If any user discharges a waste or wastewater that is inhibiting to the sewer system or wastewater treatment facility or is prohibited as outlined in §13.53, Prohibited Discharges, said user shall pay a penalty of $250.00 per violation. Each day a violation occurs shall constitute a separate violation. Said penalty shall be added to the monthly or quarterly billing statement. Written notice of violation and the intent to assess a penalty shall be forwarded to said user within 5 days of the determination of the violation. (Am. #02-0549) 
(3)  In addition to the court proceedings and penalties described in the foregoing sections of this subchapter, whenever a person violates any provision of this subchapter or fails to comply with any order of the City, the City may order that an action be commenced on behalf of the City in the Circuit Court for Waukesha County for the purpose of obtaining an injunction restraining the person violating this subchapter or failing to comply with the order from making any further discharges into the sewer system of the City. 
(4)  Any licensed disposer discharging to the wastewater treatment facility or to a public sewer found to be violating a provision of this subchapter or of any conditions of the approval for septage disposal may have their approval immediately revoked. This revocation shall be done in writing and state the reason for revoking the septage disposal approval. 
13.69 - CREATION OF COMMUNICATIONS UTILITY. (Cr. #00-0480) 
(1)  Pursuant to Chs. 62 and 66, Wis. Stats., and without limitation, §62.11(5), Wis. Stats., the City hereby exercises its authority to create a municipal communications utility within the City. 
(2)  The communications utility shall be responsible to plan, acquire, construct, extend, improve, maintain, operate, lease, dispose of, regulate, and manage a communications system in order to provide, among other things, telecommunications, data, fiber optic, Internet, cable television, video and information services. 
(3)  The communications utility shall be under the management of the Common Council which, acting as the Board of Public Works, may exercise all powers necessary or desirable to effect its purposes. 
(4)  The City hereby finds that a municipal communications system will provide public benefits by providing for the continued growth and economic development of the community and is, thereby, in the best interests of the community. The City hereby further finds that a municipal communications system is in the public interest as a means of facilitating the provision of telecommunications, data, fiber optic, Internet, cable television, video and information services to the City and its departments, the school district, and the public generally within the City.

In order to protect the public water system from contaminants due to backflow of contaminants through a water service connection, the following controls for cross-connections are adopted. 
(1)  A cross-connection is any physical connection or arrangement between 2 otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the City water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the 2 systems. 
(2)  No person shall establish or maintain any cross-connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the City may enter the supply or distribution system of the City unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the City water utility and by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in accordance with NR 111.25(3), Wis. Adm. Code.

18.03 - PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVIDING. 
(1)  SALE OF LOTS: PRELIMINARY PLAT AND FINAL PLAT REQUIRED. No person proposing to make a subdivision within the territorial limits of these regulations shall enter into any contract for the sale of, or shall offer to sell, the subdivision or any part thereof or shall proceed with any construction work, other than grading, on the proposed subdivision until he/she has obtained from the Commission and Council the approval of the preliminary and final plats of the proposed subdivision. 
(2)  PRELIMINARY CONSULTATION. (Am. #81-71) Before preparing and submitting the preliminary plat to the Commission, the subdivider or his/her engineer shall consult with the City Engineer while the plat is in sketch form to ascertain the locations of proposed highways, preliminary or secondary thoroughfares, parkways, parks, playgrounds and other planned developments. The subdivider shall also consult with the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Plan Commission to ascertain whether the proposed sewered plat is in conformance with Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Plan Commission's Area-wide Water Quality Management Plan. 
(3)  COMPLIANCE WITH DESIGN PRINCIPLES REQUIRED. (Rep. & rrec. 11-1-77) In planning and developing a subdivision, the subdivider or his/her agent shall comply with the general principles of design and with minimum requirements for the layout of subdivisions set forth in this chapter, as well as in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., and with such other regulations as from time to time become applicable. With the intent that the proposed development be consistent and harmonious with the Comprehensive Plan and integrated into the proper and consecutive order of the Development Plan schedule as adopted from time to time by the Plan Commission, every assurance is required by the Plan Commission that the land will be developed in the manner prescribed in the Comprehensive Plan and in accordance with the development schedule established by the Plan Commission. The owner or developer of the land must provide assurances consistent with Plan Commission procedures that these schedules and assurances will be timely met and adhered to. 
(4)  SCHOOL FACILITIES. The owner or subdivider, when seeking approval of a preliminary plat, division of land or planned unit development, shall offer proof as to the name of the school district or districts in which the subdivision is to be located and shall verify that all plans have been submitted to the school district. 
(5)  DEDICATION OF PUBLIC PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC SITES. (Rep. & recr. #96-0373) The requirements of this subsection are established to insure that adequate parks, open spaces and sites for other public uses are properly located and preserved as the City grows and that the cost of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional people brought into the community by land development may be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs created by the development. The requirements shall apply to all lands proposed for all residential development, including those which do not involve an additional land division. 
Any development approval which enables the creation of additional dwelling units shall require compliance with this parkland dedication or fee in lieu of land payment requirement. This would include any land division which creates new lots. It would also include any building permit for any more than one dwelling unit per existing lot (duplex, 2-flat or multifamily building). Single-family homes to be constructed on vacant lots which predate the adoption of the new subdivision ordinance would be the only dwelling units which would be exempt. 
(a)  Dedication and Reservation of Land. 
1.  Dedication of Public Ways. Whenever a tract of land being divided or subdivided or zoned in such a manner (including conditional uses, planned unit developments and zoning map amendments) so as to create or enable additional residential development, embraces all or any part of street, drainageway or other public way which has been designated in the City Comprehensive Master Plan, Park and Open Space Plan or the official City Map, said public way shall be made a part of the plat or survey map and dedicated by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or map. 
2.  Dedication of Parks, Playgrounds, and Open Spaces. (Am. #06-O670) 
a.  The subdivider/developer shall dedicate sufficient land area to provide adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs to be created by and to be provided for the land development, land division or subdivision. This shall include the provision of pedestrian and bikeway linkages necessary to provide access to park, recreation and open space areas as determined by the Plan Commission and Park and Recreation Board. Such linkages shall not be counted toward the park land dedication requirement. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for the intended park and recreation uses and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of a proposed park and recreation area shall include, but not be limited to, size, shape, topography, geography, tree cover, access and location. The determination of land suitability will be at the sole discretion of the Plan Commission acting on the recommendation of the Park and Recreation Board. All lands dedicated under this section shall have at least 100 feet of frontage on a public street. The Plan Commission and Park and Recreation Board may adjust this frontage requirement if better alternatives for access are provided. Of the abutting frontage, all costs of public streets, sidewalks and utilities (normally assessable) shall be paid for by the subdivider or developer. 
b.  At least 1,500 square feet of land shall be dedicated for each proposed residential dwelling unit within the land development, division, subdivision or comprehensive development. At least 600 square feet of land per resident shall be dedicated for each proposed institutional residential development. Where a definite commitment is made to the City by the subdivider/developer with respect to the number of dwelling units to be constructed on any parcel of land which has a zoning classification that permits multifamily use, the dedication shall be based on that number. Where no such commitment exists the dedication shall be based upon the maximum number of dwelling units which the zoning classification of the parcel will permit. 
c.  Where, in the sole discretion of the Parks and Recreation Board there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed development, land division or subdivision, the dedication of land required by subsec. (a)2.a. is not feasible, the dedication of land would not be compatible with the City Master Plan, or the Parks and Recreation Board determines that a cash contribution will better serve the public interest, the Parks and Recreation Board may waive the required land dedication. 
3.  Reservation of Public Sites and Open Spaces. In designing a land division, subdivision or comprehensive development, due consideration shall be given to the reservation of suitable sites of adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainageways and other public purposes. In the location of such, consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands for fine trees, marshes, lakes and ponds, water courses, watersheds and ravines. The subdivider may be required to reserve such school, park, recreation and public use areas for a period not to exceed 2 years for acquisition by the City, or in the case of school areas by the school district, at undeveloped land costs. 
(5A)  RESERVED. (Rpld. #05-O628) 
(5B)  CREDIT FOR PRIVATE PARK AND RECREATION AREAS. (Cr. #96-0373) Where private park and recreation areas are provided in a proposed planned development district and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the development, such areas may be credited toward, but not to exceed 25 percent of, the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes as set forth in §18.03(5)(a)2.a., provided the City Plan Commission, acting upon the recommendation of the Park and Recreation Board, finds it is in the public interest to do so and that the following standards are met: 
(a)  That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be dedicated or maintained by this ordinance and the zoning regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open spaces; and 
(b)  That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by written agreement; and 
(c)  That the use of the private open space is restricted to park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the Common Council; and 
(d)  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land; and 
(e)  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the recommendations of the adopted Park and Open Space Plan. If the proposed private park is in the service area of a park site designated in the Park Plan or a site dedicated and/or developed as a public park, then no credits will be given for private facilities. 
(f)  In making the evaluation of the credit for private recreation facilities, the Plan Commission may retain independent professional services (agreed upon by both parties) to determine the amount of credit, if any, that should be allowed. The fees for such independent evaluations shall be paid by the developer. 
(6)  LAND SUITABILITY. (Rep. & recr. #5-79) 
(a)  Prohibited on Unsuitable Land . No land shall be subdivided for residential use which is determined to be unbuildable by the City Council, after recommendation of the Plan Commission, for any of the following reasons: flooding, fluctuating or seasonal high water table, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or the City. 
(b)  Unbuildable Defined . Unbuildable land is defined as soils that have severe limitations that are difficult to overcome or that preclude their use for residential purposes. The following soil types classified and identified in the report and shown on the operational soil maps of the July 1971 SOIL SURVEY OF MILWAUKEE AND WAUKESHA COUNTIES prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey and the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station, University of Wisconsin are classified as having severe limitations for residential development with public sewer and are, therefore, considered unbuildable: Adrian (Ac), Brookston (BsA), Colwood (Cw), Drummer (Dt), Houghton (HtA, HtB), Marsh (Mf), Montgomery (Mzb), Mussey (Mzk), Navan (Na), Ogden (Oc), Palms (Pa), Pella (Ph, Pm), Pistakee (PrA), Sebewa (Sm), Wallkill (Wa) and Wet Alluvial Land (Ww). Other soils may be determined to be unbuildable for any reason listed in subsection (a) above. 
(c)  Additional Evaluation . Lands containing soils listed in subsection (b) may be included in building lots provided such building lots contain not less than 75 percent in lot area of other soils rated suitable for building construction. The Planning Commission or City Council may require restrictions on individual building lots to be placed upon the face of the subdivision plat to assure residential construction on soils classified as suitable. 
(d)  Findings [Soil Profile] . In order to define the limits of the unbuildable soils, the developer shall submit data prepared by a professional engineer with expertise in soil that will delineate the soil profile to a depth of 6 feet below the natural ground surface. Any presence of groundwater or soil mottling shall be so indicated on the soil profile noting the depth at which it occurs and the extent of such observed groundwater or soil mottling. The Plan Commission may require that additional data be presented before making the findings required under subsection (e) concerning suitability. If the Commission shall arrange for an independent expert, acceptable to both the developer and the Plan Commission, to make further studies or to evaluate the date submitted by the developer, the costs thereof shall be paid by the developer. 
(e)  Findings . In applying the provisions of this section, the Plan Commission shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusions that the land is not suitable for residential use. Such findings shall be submitted to the City Council as a recommendation, and the Council may approve, modify or reject the Plan Commission's findings and recommendations. 
(f)  Modifications . No modification may be granted by the City Council without having first received the findings and recommendations of the Plan Commission as provided in subsection (e). Where, in the judgment of the City Council, it would be inappropriate literally to apply the provisions of this section because of unique circumstances as to the extent of unbuildable soils, the City Council may modify any provision of this section which it deems just and proper. In determining whether such modification is to be granted, consideration shall be given to whether such relief would impair the intent and general purpose of this section. 
(7)  RESERVED. (Cr. #17-78; Rep. #13-O841) 
18.04 - PRELIMINARY PLAT. 
(1)  PREPARATION AND APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL. The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision which shall conform to the requirements set forth in this chapter and in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., and shall file with the City Engineer an application in writing for the approval of the preliminary plat, accompanied by 10 black line or photostatic copies, at least 15 days prior to the meeting of the Commission at which action is desired. 
(2)  REVIEW BY OTHER AGENCIES. The preliminary plat shall be checked by the Commission as to its conformity with the Thoroughfare Plan and with the principles, standard and requirements herein set forth; and copies of the preliminary plat shall be referred for recommendations or other actions as follows: 
(a)  Plats Within City . For plats within the City, to the City Engineer for checking of matters within his/her jurisdiction and for approval by his/her office of improvements proposed to be installed, and to the Superintendent of Utilities for checking of matters within his/her jurisdiction and for approval by his/her office of the improvements proposed to be installed. 
(b)  Plats Outside the City . For plats outside the City, to the county park and planning commission for checking of matters within its jurisdiction, for reference to the State Department of Health and Social Services, when appropriate, and for approval in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the county board of improvements proposed to be installed; to the City Engineer and The Superintendent of Utilities for matters within their jurisdiction; and to the town board of the town in which the subdivision is located. 
(c)  Plats Containing Five or More Parcels . For plats containing 5 or more parcels or building sites of 11/2 acres each or less or where such are created by successive divisions within a period of 5 years, to all proper agencies of the State as are required by law, including the State Highway Division where the subdivision abuts or adjoins a State trunk highway or connecting street and the State Department of Health and Social Services where a subdivision is not served by a public sewer, for review of all or pertinent sections of the proposed subdivision. 
(3)  PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL. 
(a)  Upon receipt of the recommendations or other actions concerning matters covered in subsection (2), the Commission shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat or shall approve it with modifications, noting thereon any changes that will be required. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider with the date of such approval or disapproval endorsed thereon. Similar copies shall be transmitted to the City Engineer and to the Superintendent of Utilities. The approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission shall be considered only an approval of the general layout, with the understanding that the City Engineer or other official having jurisdiction, including the Commission and the Council, may modify any engineering or construction details proposed by the subdivider whenever required for the protection of the public interest and before approval of the final plat. 
(b)  The Commission may refuse to approve a plat submitted by a subdivider which conforms to the minimum development standards of the City for the following reasons: 
1.  The preliminary or final plat is not concerned with the best use of the land for the area. 
2.  It is not the intent of the City to allow subdivisions to be developed in exact accordance with the minimum standards established by the City. 
3.  The proposed or final plat as prepared by the subdivider has not concerned itself with the aesthetic values of the area which the City desires. 
4.  The unavailability of, and/or the inability of the City to provide, adequate services for the area at the time of submission of the plat for consideration and/or noncompliance with Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Plan Commission's Area-Wide Water Quality Management Plan. (Am. #81-71) 
5.  The possible adverse effect that such plat would have upon the property tax base of the City or the school tax base of Joint School District Number Three. 
6.  Any other valuable and reasonable reasons of the Commission. 
18.05 - FINAL PLAT. 
(1)  SURETY BOND. Before the final plat of a subdivision located within the City is approved, the subdivider shall file with the Commission a surety bond in a sum sufficient to cover the costs of completion of all required work as demanded by this chapter, including required streets and utility improvements. Such bond shall be executed by the subdivider as principal, or by all of the subcontractors as principals, and by a corporation authorized to do so under the laws of the State as surety, payable to the City, and shall be conditioned on the faithful performance of all work encompassed in this chapter. In lieu of a bond, the subdivider may deposit with the City a sum of money in cash equal to the amount of the estimated cost of the work as determined by the responsible officials of the City. As an alternate to the bond or cash deposit, the Council may accept a contractual commitment from a federal or State approved lending institution guaranteeing accessibility of money to complete all required work and committing the money to the City upon default of the subdivider or upon failure to timely perform the required work. Such bond, or the cash equivalent or the contract, shall be deposited with the City by submitting the same to the City Clerk and shall be approved by the Council prior to approval of the final plat by the Commission. Such bond, or the cash equivalent or the contract, shall be conditioned that, should the subdivider fail to complete all work required in the subdivision within a reasonable time, the City, at its option, may cause all work to be completed; and the parties executing the bond or the contract shall be firmly bound for the payment of all necessary costs therefor. 
(2)  FILING. The subdivider shall file with the Commission the final plat of the subdivision for final approval as set forth in subsection (3). The final plat of any portion of a larger subdivision, the preliminary plat of which has been approved by the Commission, may be submitted for approval. 
(3)  NUMBER OF COPIES; CERTIFICATE OF TITLE. The subdivider shall file with the Commission 10 black line or blueprints or photostatic copies of the final or record plat, which shall conform to the requirements specified in this chapter and in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. These shall be accompanied by a certification of title showing the ownership of all lands to be dedicated to the public, the title thereof to be free and unencumbered. Filing of the plat with the Commission shall be accompanied by delivery of the copies to the City Engineer. No action on such plat shall be taken by the Commission unless the copies have been deposited with the City Engineer for 15 days and the City Engineer has submitted his/her report to the Commission in accordance with subsection (4). 
(4)  REVIEW BY CITY ENGINEER. A copy of the final plat thus filed shall be transmitted to the City Engineer, who shall check the final plat. The City Engineer shall deliver a copy of the final plat to the Superintendent of Utilities for his/her approval. If found satisfactory, he/she shall deliver the plat to the Commission, together with a two-fold certificate showing that the technical details of the plat itself have been checked and found satisfactory and a statement indicating the necessary work that must be performed by the subdivider prior to the completion of the subdivision, together with a statement of the estimated cost of all such projects for the purpose of establishing the basis of the bond required by this section. 
(5)  REVIEW BY STATE AGENCIES. Where a preliminary plat is subject to review by any State agency, the final plat shall also be submitted to such agency. 
(6)  APPROVAL. Upon nonobjection to the final plat by the State agencies concerned or after 20 days from the date of submission of the plat to such agencies, and after a copy of the final plat together with the foregoing two-fold certificate has been received by the Commission from the City Engineer, and if the final plat is found to conform with the preliminary plat as tentatively approved or as modified by the City officials, the Commission may approve the final plat and enter such approval thereon in writing by its chairman and secretary. 
18.06 - ACCEPTANCE OF PLAT. 
Upon such approval, the Commission shall transmit the final plat, together with all certificates and notations required by the law, to the Council. The Council shall approve, disapprove or partially approve the plat. Acceptance of the plat by the Council shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by the public of the dedication of any street or other proposed public way or space shown on such plat. For a subdivision outside the City, the plat shall be referred to the County officials and the Town Board of the town wherein the subdivision is located for such action as may be necessary to accept the plat. No plat of a subdivision within the City shall be approved by the Council until a reproducible tracing of the recorded plat is transmitted to the City Engineer. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed acceptance by the City of the improvements placed upon such property, the requirements of which are set forth elsewhere in this chapter.

The developer shall perform the planting on the lots within the 50 percent for which building permits have been issued after driveway locations for individual lots or parcels have been established. The developer shall plant or provide one tree for each 50 feet of frontage on all public streets within the subdivision. All plant materials shall conform to the guidelines set forth by the American Standard for Nursery Stock. The minimum tree size, tree species, spacing requirements, and other planting restrictions shall conform to the City of Oconomowoc "Street Tree Planting Policy" dated February 1, 2009, as amended from time to time, and Chapter 8A of the Municipal Code. 
After plan approval and at the developer's option, the developer may plant all required street trees in the locations set forth on the approved plan. 
(c)  Relocation of Street Trees . If trees are to be relocated due to driveway locations, they shall be removed, relocated or replaced by the property owner at the property owner's expense. 
(d)  Alternate Planting Location . If due to driveway locations or the location of other public facilities it is impossible to plant the required street trees within the subdivision, those trees not able to be planted within the subdivision terrace areas shall be planted in a public park or appropriate open space nearest to the subdivision. The trees to be planted elsewhere than in the subdivision shall be planted by the City. 
(e)  Guarantee . The developer shall remain responsible for costs associated with replacing and planting any trees that have died for a period of 2 years after the initial planting. All replacement trees shall be of the equivalent size and species of the trees being replaced. 
(f)  Security . Performance of this street tree planting program shall be secured by a letter of credit or other acceptable financial guarantee filed with the City. The obligation set forth in this section is a continuing obligation; however, it is acknowledged that lots may remain unimproved for years after final plat approval. If the developer desires to be released of further obligations under this section, the developer and the City may negotiate the obligation for further compliance with this section and the plan.

18.09 - MODIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS. 
(1)  GENERALLY. The general principles and design standards and the minimum requirements for the laying out of subdivisions stipulated in §18.11 may be varied by the Commission in the case of a subdivision large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood to be developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by appropriate restrictions which, in the judgment of the Commission, make adequate provisions for all essential community requirements; provided no modification shall be made by the Commission which would conflict with the Thoroughfare Plan or the official plan for schools, parks and other features of the City plan or with the intent and purpose of the general principles of design and with minimum requirements. 
(2)  UNDUE HARDSHIP. In any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by reason of exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with any requirement of these regulations would cause practical difficulty or exceptional or undue hardship, the Commission may relax such requirements to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good and without impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations or the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the community in accordance with the City plan and the zoning regulations. Any modification thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the Commission, setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Commission, justify the modification. 
18.10 - COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING CODE AND OTHER REGULATIONS. 
The provisions of this chapter and the enforcement hereof shall be subject to all other provisions of this Municipal Code, except where such other regulations are in conflict directly herewith. In the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction where there is no local building code, compliance with the City Building Code shall be a condition subsequent to the City's approval of such final plat. 
18.11 - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR LAYOUT. 
In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the following general principles and requirements: 
(1)  GENERAL. The subdivision layout shall conform to the official thoroughfare plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway, thoroughfare or parkway so designated on the Thoroughfare Plan, such part of such public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the locations and at the widths indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan. 
(2)  STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT. 
(a)  The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and of the entire neighborhood. 
(b)  Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. 
(c)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by the topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layouts or for the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets of reasonable length (normally, not over 600 feet) will be approved where necessitated by topography or where, in the opinion of the Commission, they are appropriate to the type of development contemplated. 
(d)  Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. 
(e)  Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided a dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley shall be platted. 
(f)  Alleys shall be platted in business districts. To provide safe access to residential lots fronting on thoroughfares, major streets, parkways and alleys shall be platted in the rear of such lots or service drives shall be provided in front thereof. Alleys shall not be approved in other locations in residential districts unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions. 
(g)  Lands abutting a highway or principal thoroughfare shall be platted with the view to making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways and with a view to minimizing interference with traffic, as well as accident hazards, on such trafficways. This may be accomplished by any of the following means: 
1.  By platting the lots abutting such a trafficway at very generous depths, and by providing vehicular access to them by means of alleys or service drives in the rear or by frontage access roads next to the highway, connected therewith at infrequent intervals. 
2.  By fronting the lots not on the highway but on a minor street paralleling the highway at a distance of a generous lot depth, with private driveways connecting with such minor street. 
3.  By platting a collector street more or less parallel with the highway, 600 to 1,000 feet distant therefrom, from which loop streets or dead-end streets extend toward the highway, the ends of which give access to the lots abutting the highway to the rear. 
Selection in the specific case among the foregoing or other methods for accomplishing the purposes in view must necessarily be made in consideration of topography and other physical conditions, the character of existing and contemplated developments and other pertinent factors that apply in each case. 
(h)  A subdivision abutting a stream or lake shall have roads at least 60 feet wide providing access to the low-water mark so that there will be roads at one-half mile intervals as measured along the stream or lake shore. 
(i)  Blocks shall be of sufficient width to provide for 2 tiers of lots of appropriate depth. 
(j)  The lengths of blocks shall be, in the opinion of the Commission, appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but shall not exceed 1,800 feet where the average size of lots does not exceed 2 acres in area. 
(k)  For any block over 900 feet in length, the Commission may require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than 10 feet wide, be provided near the center and entirely across such block. 
(l)  The number of intersecting streets along highways, thoroughfares and parkways shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, blocks along such trafficways shall not be less than 1,200 feet in length. 
(3)  MINIMUM RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTH OF STREETS, ALLEYS AND EASEMENTS FOR UTILITIES. 
(a)  Street rights-of-way shall be of the following widths: 
1.  Highways, primary thoroughfares and parkways, not less than 100 feet. 
2.  Secondary thoroughfares, not less than 80 feet. 
3.  Local streets or collector streets, 60 feet. 
4.  Minor streets and dead-end streets, 60 feet. All dead-end streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way diameter of 120 feet, unless the Commission approves a "T" or "Y" shaped paved space in place of the required turning circle. 
(b)  Where easements are required for utilities, their width shall be at least 10 feet along rear or side lot lines. 
(4)  MINIMUM STREET SURFACE WIDTHS. 
(a)  Minimum street surface widths of the roadway, and graded and seeded center strips, required to be installed at the subdivider's expense shall be as follows: 
1.  120-foot major thoroughfares, 100-foot highways, primary thoroughfares and parkways: 60 feet. If a divided roadway is required, 26 feet for each roadway and 20 feet for a center strip. 
2.  80-foot secondary thoroughfares: 44 feet. 
3.  60-foot local streets: 36 feet. 
4.  Minor and dead-end streets not over 600 feet long: 34 feet. 
5.  Alleys and service drives: 18 feet. 
(b)  The surface of a turning circle at the end of a dead-end street shall have a minimum outside diameter of 80 feet. A "T" or "Y" shaped surface space, when approved by the Commission in place of a turning circle, shall extend across the width of the street right-of-way, except for sidewalk space, and shall be at least 10 feet wide at the flared portion, rounded by minimum radii of 20 feet. 
(5)  STREET GRADES, CURVES AND SIGHT DISTANCE. 
(a)  The grades of streets shall not exceed the following; except where unusual or exceptional conditions exist, the Commission may modify these regulations: 
1.  Highways and primary thoroughfares, 4 percent. 
2.  Secondary thoroughfares, parkways, local streets, minor streets, service drives and alleys, 7 percent. 
3.  Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, 12 percent unless steps of an acceptable design are to be constructed. 
(b)  All changes in street grades in excess of 1 percent shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in the rate of grade for highways, thoroughfares and parkways and one-half this minimum for all other streets.

(b)  Street curb intersections may be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet. 
(c)  The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle of intersection is less than 60 degrees. 
(7)  LOTS. 
(a)  The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development contemplated. 
(b)  Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A proportion of 2:1 shall normally be considered as appropriate, except in the case of narrow lots. 
(c)  Every lot shall abut on a street. 
(d)  A lot shall comply with all of the minimum requirements of that particular zoning district wherein located, including area, width, and all other zoning requirements. The Commission, under §18.09 of this chapter, may relax certain of these requirements under specific sets of facts. 
(e)  Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided. 
(f)  Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-way line of the street on which the lot faces. 
(g)  Corner lots for residential use shall be platted wider than interior lots in order to permit conformance with the front yard setback on the side street required by the zoning regulations. 
(h)  Residential lots fronting or abutting on highways, thoroughfares and other important trafficways should have extra depth to permit deep setbacks for the building from such trafficways. 
(i)  1.  Lands annexed to the City and developed as residential lots shall be zoned and developed in accordance with the R-1B One-Family Residential District, in accordance with §17.13 of this Municipal Code, which provides for, among other items, minimum lot sizes of 12,000 square feet and individual lot frontages of 100 feet. 
2.  In approving a preliminary or final plat of such lands, however, the Commission may allow certain lots to have less than the required 100-foot frontage, taking into consideration the best land use; provided the mean width of the lot is at least 100 feet and the total lot size is at least 12,000 square feet.

19.01 - AUTHORITY FOR ORDINANCE. 
This ordinance applies to land disturbing and land development activities on lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Oconomowoc and is adopted under the authority granted by §62.234, §92.07(15), §281.33, and Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. The requirements of this ordinance do not preempt more stringent erosion and sediment control storm water management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals, including those authorized under §281.16 and §283.33, Wis. Stats. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code. 
19.02 - FINDINGS OF FACT. 
The Common Council of the City of Oconomowoc finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled soil erosion and storm water runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants; 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads; 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers, drainage ways and other storm drainage systems; 
(6)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and 
(7)  Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment. 
19.03 - PURPOSE AND INTENT. 
(a)  The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish regulatory requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources of the City of Oconomowoc from construction site erosion and post-construction storm water runoff. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; establish erosion control and storm water standards for building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion, control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger property. 
(b)  Through a single storm water permit process, this ordinance is intended to meet the current construction site erosion control and post-construction storm water management regulatory requirements of Subch. III of both NR 151 and NR 216, Wis. Adm. Code on the effective date of this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance prevents the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources from adopting or enforcing more stringent storm water management requirements in future revisions of Wisconsin Administrative Code. 
(c)  Provisions have also been incorporated to coordinate the storm water permit requirements of this ordinance with other City zoning and land division regulations. 
(d)  The Common Council recognizes that the preferred method of addressing post-construction storm water runoff from land development activities is through the preparation and implementation of regional storm water management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds or subwatersheds. Accordingly, provisions have been incorporated into this ordinance to allow for the implementation of a regional storm water management plan in lieu of complying with certain on-site storm water management requirements. 
19.04 - GENERAL ADMINISTRATION.

To meet this requirement, the following performance standards shall apply: 
(1)  All erosion control plans and associated BMPs shall comply with the planning, design, implementation and maintenance requirements of this ordinance and the Technical Standards prepared by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(2)  All erosion control plans shall by design, achieve to the maximum extent practicable, a runoff discharge of no more than 5 tons of sediment per acre per year from sheet and rill erosion during land disturbing activities, as compared with no sediment or erosion controls, until the site is stabilized. 
(3)  Erosion and sediment control BMPs may be used alone or in combination to meet the above noted performance standard. The requirements of this §19.10 are designed to meet this standard. 
(b)  GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EROSION CONTROL. To satisfy the requirements of this section, an erosion control plan shall adhere to the following guiding principles: 
(1)  Propose grading that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, environmental corridors and any applicable regulatory setbacks from these areas. 
(2)  Minimize, through project phasing and construction sequencing, the time the disturbed soil surface is exposed to erosive forces. 
(3)  Minimize soil compaction, the loss of trees and other natural vegetation and the size of the disturbed area at any one time. 
(4)  Locate erosion control BMPs upstream from where runoff leaves the site or enters waters of the State and outside of wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental corridors or isolated natural areas. 
(5)  Emphasize the use of BMPs that prevent soil detachment and transport over those aimed to reduce soil deposition (sedimentation) or repair erosion damage. 
(c)  SPECIFIC EROSION CONTROL PLAN REQUIREMENTS. The following applicable minimum requirements shall be addressed in erosion control plans. The DPW may establish more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements than the minimums set forth in this section if the DPW determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect an environmentally sensitive area or other property, or to address a change made during plan implementation. 
(1)  Access Drives and Tracking . Provide access drive(s) for construction vehicles that minimize tracking of soil off site using BMPs such as stone tracking pads, tire washing or grates. Minimize runoff and sediment from adjacent areas from flowing down or eroding the access drive. 
(2)  Diversion of Upslope Runoff . Divert excess runoff from upslope land, rooftops or other surfaces, if practicable, using BMPs such as earthen diversion berms, and downspout extenders. Prevent erosion of the flow path and the outlet. 
(3)  Inlet Protection . Protect inlets to storm drains, culverts and other storm water conveyance systems from siltation until the site is stabilized. 
(4)  Soil Stockpiles . Locate soil stockpiles away from channelized flow and no closer than 25 feet from roads, ditches, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands or environmental corridors, unless otherwise approved by the DPW. Control sediment from soil stockpiles. Any soil stockpile that remains unworked for more than 30 days shall be stabilized. 
(5)  Cut and Fill Slopes . Minimize the length and steepness of proposed cut and fill slopes and stabilize them as soon as practicable. 
(6)  Channel Flow . During construction, trap sediment in channelized flow before discharge from the site using BMPs such as sediment traps and sediment basins. Complete final grading and stabilize open channels in accordance with DPW standards as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the first ground freeze or snow cover in the fall. 
(7)  Outlet Protection . Protect outlets from erosion during site dewatering and storm water conveyance, including velocity dissipation at pipe outfalls or open channels entering or leaving a storm water management facility. 
(8)  Overland Flow . Trap sediment in overland flow before discharge from the site using BMPs such as silt fence and vegetative filter strips. 
(9)  Site Dewatering . Treat pumped water to remove sediment prior to discharge from the site, using BMPs such as sediment basins and portable sediment tanks. 
(10)  Dust Control . Prevent excessive dust from leaving the construction site though construction phasing and timely stabilization or the use of BMPs such as site watering and mulch-especially with very dry or fine sandy soils. 
(11)  Topsoil Application . Save existing topsoil and reapply a minimum of 4 inches to all disturbed areas for final stabilization, unless otherwise approved by the DPW, such as for temporary seeding or storm water infiltration BMPs. If adequate topsoil does not exist on the site to meet this requirement, it shall be imported or a topsoil substitute such as compost may be used, upon approval by the DPW. 
(12)  Waste Material . Recycle or properly dispose all waste and unused building materials in a timely manner. Control runoff from waste materials until they are removed or reused. 
(13)  Sediment Cleanup . By the end of each workday, clean up all on-site and off-site sediment deposits or tracked soil that originated from the permitted site. Flushing shall not be allowed unless runoff is treated before discharge from the site. 
(14)  Final Site Stabilization . All previous cropland areas where land disturbing activities will not be occurring under the proposed grading plans shall be stabilized within 30 days of permit issuance. Stabilize all other disturbed areas within 7 days of final grading and topsoil application. Large sites shall be treated in stages as final grading is completed in each stage. Any soil erosion that occurs after final grading or the application of stabilization measures must be repaired and the stabilization work redone. 
(15)  Temporary Site Stabilization . Any disturbed site or portion thereof that remains inactive for greater than 7 days shall be stabilized with temporary stabilization measures such as soil treatment, temporary seeding or mulching. For purposes of this subsection, "inactive" means that no site grading, landscaping or utility work is occurring on the site or a portion of the site and that precipitation events are not limiting these activities. Frozen soils do not exclude the site from this requirement. 
(16)  Removal of Practices . Remove all temporary BMPs such as silt fences, ditch checks and sediment traps as soon as all disturbed areas have been stabilized. 
(17)  Site Drainage . Site drainage plans shall comply with the provisions of §19.11(d)(6) below. 
(18)  Storm Water BMP Data . When a storm water permit involves the maintenance of an existing storm water BMP, including the removal of accumulated sediment, the DPW may require additional support data such as before/after surveys, design and construction details, and oversight by a professional engineer licensed in Wisconsin.

(3)  Locate storm water BMPs prior to runoff leaving the site or entering waters of the State, and outside of wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental corridors or isolated natural areas; 
(4)  Minimize soil compaction and maintain pre-development groundwater recharge areas; 
(5)  Minimize impervious surfaces and have them drain to vegetated areas for pollutant filtering and infiltration; 
(6)  Emphasize vegetated swales, warm season and wetland plantings, and low flow velocities for storm water conveyance, treatment and infiltration, especially for transportation related projects; 
Note: Tall, dense, deep-rooted vegetation and low velocities in open channels encourages infiltration and increases their effectiveness for runoff pollutant removal. Check dams may also be included in the swale design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant removal. Soil amendments such as compost can help reduce soil compaction and increase infiltration. 
(7)  Allow for different storm water management strategies for cleaner runoff (i.e., roofs) versus more polluted runoff (i.e., heavily used streets and parking lots); 
(8)  Provide for emergency overflow in all storm water BMP designs; 
(9)  Distribute storm water bioretention and infiltration BMPs throughout the site plan for large land developments. 
(c)  SITE PLAN MAP REQUIREMENTS. A site plan map and supporting data of site conditions at a scale of one inch equals no more than 100 feet (unless otherwise noted) shall delineate or display all the following applicable items: 
(1)  Development title, graphic scale and north arrow; 
(2)  Property location description by public land survey system (1/4 section, section, township, range, county); 
(3)  Location map (smaller scale) showing the site location within a public land survey section or subdivision, oriented the same as subsection (4) below;

(25)  Notes describing source documents, date and measure of accuracy for all applicable mapping features noted above; 
(26)  Other site information that the DPW determines is necessary to administer this ordinance. 
(d)  SPECIFIC STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. All storm water management plans and associated BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements to the maximum extent practicable. All requirements apply to each subwatershed or storm water discharge point independently and cannot be averaged for the site. Runoff draining to a storm water BMP from off-site must be accounted for hydraulically in any BMP design. It is highly recommended that the applicant meet with the DPW prior to preparing a storm water management plan to determine the applicability of these requirements early in the site planning process. 
Note: The "maximum extent practicable" (MEP) standard applies to each of the 7 sections of plan requirements and performance standards described below. 
(1)  Peak Discharge . 
a.  Minimum Requirement . To minimize downstream bank erosion and the failure of downstream conveyance systems, the calculated post-development peak storm water discharge rate shall not exceed the calculated pre-development discharge rates for the one-year, 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year, 24-hour design storms. Modeling requirements for this provision are further described in §19.12 below. 
b.  Release Rate per Acre . The DPW may establish a maximum allowable release rate on a per acre basis that would supersede the requirements of subsection a. above for certain watersheds after the necessary hydrologic modeling is completed and the maximum release rate is approved by the DPW. 
(2)  Total Suspended Solids . 
a.  By design, each storm water management plan shall meet the following post-development total suspended solids reduction targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as compared to no runoff management controls: 
(i)  For new land development and in-fill development, 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids load; 
(ii)  For redevelopment, 40 percent reduction of total suspended solids load from parking areas and roads. 
(3)  Infiltration . 
a.  Shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the performance standards in Table 1 except as provided in subsections d. through h. below.

a  All percentages are based on average annual rainfall. 
b  To avoid downstream flooding and chronic wetness issues from storm water discharges, the post-development infiltration volume for low density residential developments shall not be less than 25 percent of the 2-year, 24-hour storm, in accordance with subsection (7) below. 
b.  Modeling . Refer to §19.12(a) for details on calculating runoff volumes and pre-development conditions. 
c.  Pretreatment . Pretreatment shall be required before infiltrating parking lot and road runoff from commercial, industrial and institutional areas. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with subsection h. below. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separators, sedimentation or bioretention basins, filtration swales or filter strips. All designs shall comply with the technical standards in §19.12(b). 
Note: To achieve the infiltration requirement for the parking lots or roads, "maximum extent practicable" should not be interpreted to require significant topography changes that create an excessive financial burden. To minimize potential groundwater impacts, it is desirable to infiltrate the cleanest runoff. To achieve this, a design may propose greater infiltration of runoff from low pollutant sources such as roofs, and less from higher pollutant source areas such as parking lots. 
d.  Infiltration Prohibitions . Due to potential for groundwater contamination, runoff shall not be infiltrated and will not be credited toward meeting the requirements of this subsection for the following: 
(i)  Runoff from outdoor material storage and loading docks for tier 1 and tier 2 industrial facilities, as identified in NR 216(2) Wis. Adm. Code. Parking lot runoff from tier 1 industrial facilities is prohibited. Parking lot runoff from tier 2 facilities may be infiltrated, but may require pretreatment. 
(ii)  Runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas, not including rooftops and canopies. 
(iii)  Infiltration of runoff within 1,000 feet upgradient or within 100 feet downgradient of karst features. 
(iv)  Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as specified in s. NR 811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, or within 100 feet of a private well as specified in s. NR 812.08(4), Wis. Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development, not including rooftop runoff. 
(v)  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in s. NR 720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur. 
e.  Separation Distances . Infiltration BMPs shall be located so the characteristics of the soil and the separation distance between the bottom of the infiltration BMP and the elevation of the highest groundwater table or the top of bedrock are in accordance with Table 2. 
TABLE 2 
INFILTRATION BMP SEPARATION DISTANCES AND 
SOIL CHARACTERISTICS

f.  Infiltration Exemptions . The infiltration requirements of this subsection may be exempted by the DWP where: 
(i)  The soils at the proposed bottom of an infiltration system have a measured infiltration rate of less than 0.6 inches per hour using a scientifically credible field test method; and 
(ii)  The DPW determines it would be impracticable to modify existing soil conditions based on soil profile evaluations extending 5 feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration system. 
g.  Alternate Runoff Uses . Where storage and reuse of runoff are employed, such as landscape watering, toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, or storage on green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate uses shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section. 
h.  Groundwater Protection . 
(i)  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this subsection shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Ch. NR 140 Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
(ii)  Notwithstanding subsection (i) above, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
(iii)  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the applicable provisions of Ch. NR 815 Wis. Adm. Code relating to injection wells. 
(iv)  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the provisions of any applicable wellhead protection plan for a community water supply under Ch. NR 811 Wis. Adm. Code. 
(4)  Protective Areas . 
a.  Definitions . "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
(i)  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet. 
(ii)  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on the Waukesha County GIS system, 50 feet. If there is a discrepancy between the Waukesha County GIS system and the applicable United States Geological Survey 7 5-minute series topographic map, the more stringent stream identification shall apply. 
(iii)  For lakes, 50 feet. 
(iv)  For wetlands not subject to subsection (v), 50 feet. 
(v)  For highly susceptible wetlands, as determined by the DPW, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds. 
(vi)  Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with Ch. NR 103 Wis. Adm. Code. This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable State and Federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable State and Federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. 
(vii)  For less susceptible wetlands, 10 percent of the average wetland width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet unless otherwise required by another applicable regulation. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass. 
(viii)  In subsections a.(i), (iv) and (v), determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Ch. NR 103 Wis. Adm. Code. 
(ix)  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, 10 feet. 
b.  Requirements . The following requirements shall be met for all land development activity located within a protective area: 
(i)  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area, except for structures as authorized and defined under shoreland and floodland zoning. The erosion control plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the storm water management plan shall contain a written, site specific explanation, and a technical exemption may be applied for under subsection (e) below. 
(ii)  Where land disturbing activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
Note: It is recommended that seeding of non-aggressive vegetative cover be used in the protective areas. Vegetation that is flood and drought tolerant and can provide long-term bank stability because of an extensive root system is preferable. Vegetative cover can be measured using the line transect method described in the University of Wisconsin Extension publication number A3533, titled "Estimating Residue Using the Line Transect Method." 
(iii)  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area, but shall not encroach into wetlands, floodplains or primary or secondary environmental corridors. 
c.  Protective Area Exemptions . The protective area requirements of this subsection may be exempted in accordance with subsection (e) below and do not apply to the following: 
(i)  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts; 
(ii)  Structures constructed in accordance with §59.692(1v), Wis. Stats.; and 
(iii)  Sites where runoff does not enter the surface water, including wetlands, without first being treated by a BMP to meet the total suspended solids requirements under subsection (2) above and peak discharge requirements under subsection (1) above, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability. 
Note: A vegetated protective area to filter runoff pollutants from post-construction sites described in subsection (4)c. above is not necessary since runoff is not entering the surface water at that location. Other practices, necessary to meet the requirements of this section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the runoff enters a surface water of the State. 
(5)  Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas . Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the State contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
Note: A combination of the following BMPs may be used: oil and grease separators, canopies, petroleum spill cleanup materials, or any other structural or non-structural method of preventing or treating petroleum in runoff. 
(6)  Site Drainage . Measures shall be implemented to ensure proper site drainage, prevent property damage and protect public health and safety, including the following minimum requirements: 
a.  Drainage Easement . Perpetual drainage easements or other deed restrictions shall be recorded on the property to preserve major storm water flow paths and permanent storm water BMP locations. Covenants in these areas shall not allow buildings or other structures and shall prevent any grading, filling or other activities that interrupt or obstruct flows in any way. Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in accordance with §19.13. 
b.  Site Grading . Site grading shall ensure positive flows away from all buildings, roads, driveways and septic systems, be coordinated with the general storm water drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties. An analysis of downstream facilities will be required by the City. 
c.  Street Drainage . All street drainage shall be designed to prevent concentrated flows from crossing the traffic lanes. Design flow depths at the road centerline for on-street drainage, shall not exceed 6 inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. 
d.  Bridges and Cross-Culverts . All new or modified bridges and cross-culverts shall comply with applicable design standards and regulations, facilitate fish passage and prevent increased flooding or channel erosion upstream or downstream from the structure. All bridges and cross culverts on collector streets and arterial roadways shall be designed to convey the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. All bridges and cross culverts on local roadways shall be designed to convey the 10-year, 24-hour design storm while providing an overland flow path that does not impact any structures for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. A floodplain analysis is required for all projects impacting a navigable waterway. This analysis must demonstrate no adverse offsite impacts, in accordance with State and Federal regulations and may require larger structures than those specified above. Design flow depths at the road centerline for all crossings shall not exceed 6 inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. All predevelopment runoff storage areas within the flow path upstream of bridges and cross-culverts shall be preserved and designated as drainage easements, unless compensatory storage is provided and accounted for in modeling. As-built documentation shall be submitted in accordance with §19.09 for all new or modified structures that are located within a mapped floodplain or that the DPW determines to be necessary to maintain floodplain modeling for the applicable watershed. 
e.  Subsurface Drainage . To avoid property and other damages from groundwater, all buildings planned for human occupation on a regular basis shall meet all of the following. 
(i)  Basement floor surfaces shall be built a minimum of one foot above the highest groundwater table elevation, as documented in the submitted soil evaluations in accordance with the County's standards. On sloped sites, basements may be allowed partially below the highest groundwater table only on the upslope side if they meet the County's drainage system standards for design, discharge, engineering oversight, and long-term maintenance. For these sites, the one-foot groundwater separation will be enforced at the further down slope point of the basement. 
(ii)  Avoid hydric soils as much as possible. 
(iii)  The DPW shall be notified of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which the DPW may require to be restored or connected to other drainage systems. 
(iv)  No discharge of groundwater from tile lines, sump pumps or other means shall be allowed onto another person's land or any public space without the written approval of the City and the property owner. 
Note: The County has published technical standards to implement the above noted basement/groundwater separation requirements. Refer to a separate document titled "Basement Wetness and Flooding Prevention Standards" on the Waukesha County web site (www.waukeshacounty.gov). 
f.  Open Channels . All open channel drainage systems shall at a minimum be designed to carry the peak flows from a 10-year, 24-hour design storm using planned land use for the entire contributing watershed area. Side slopes are preferred at 4h:1v and shall be no steeper than 3h:1v and the longitudinal slope shall be no flatter than one percent unless otherwise approved by the DPW for unique site conditions. Water surface elevations for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm shall be calculated for all existing and proposed open channels. 
g.  Storm Sewers . All storm sewers shall be designed in accordance with applicable community technical standards and specifications. 
h.  Changes to Storm Water Discharges . For sites where the City determines the post-development storm water discharge flow paths will be significantly different than pre-development conditions, or where proposed storm water discharges may otherwise have a significant negative impact on downstream property owner(s), the City may require the applicant to submit written authorization, record a drainage easement, or complete other legal arrangements with the affected property owner(s) prior to permit issuance. 
i.  Structure Protection and Safety . Flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm under planned land use conditions may exceed the design capacity of conveyance systems, but shall not come in contact with any buildings. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular basis, the following additional requirements shall apply: 
(i)  The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface shall be a minimum of 2 feet above the maximum water surface elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, including flows through any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot; and 
(ii)  The structure shall be setback at least 50 feet from any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot, including any internally drained area with a significant contributing watershed and/or limited runoff storage capacity, as determined by the DPW. Setback distance shall be measured from the closest edge of water at the elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. The DPW may exempt existing structures and structures with no basement from this requirement if the DPW determines other site risks are minimal based on soil and site conditions. 
(7)  Additional Requirements . The DPW may establish more stringent requirements than the minimums set forth in this section, such as addressing thermal impacts of storm water, downstream flooding, a total maximum daily load (TMDL) standard for a watershed, other applicable State or Federal laws, an order of any court of competent jurisdiction, or chronic wetness conditions, if the DPW determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect: 
a.  Rosenow Creek, a cold water stream; 
b.  An environmentally sensitive area; 
c.  A downstream property; 
d.  Public health or safety. 
(e)  TECHNICAL EXEMPTIONS. 
(1)  Exemption Criteria . Following the provisions of this subsection, the DPW may exempt a site or a portion of a site from meeting certain technical requirements of this section if the DPW determines that exemption criteria under subsection (d) above or one or more of the following applies: 
a.  Off-Site BMP(s) . The requirement has been satisfied through the use of off-site BMP(s). Off-site BMPs could be installed beyond the boundaries of the property covered by the application as part of a regional storm water management plan or through other legal arrangements. However, to be eligible for this exemption, the off-site BMP(s) must treat runoff from the site covered by the application. 
b.  No Significant Off-Site Impacts . The proposed land disturbing or land development activity is less than one acre in size and the DPW has determined the activity will have no significant impact on another property or an environmentally sensitive area due to internal drainage or other site conditions that limit the potential impacts of runoff from the proposed activity. 
Note: Only ordinance requirements that address impacts would be eligible for this exemption. Examples of requirements that may still apply to a newly constructed building include drainage easements, setbacks, basement/groundwater separation, and other site drainage or flood prevention standards. 
c.  Site Conditions . It is impracticable to meet the requirement due to site conditions such as slopes, soils, proximity to existing structures or desirable trees, limited site dimensions, surrounding land uses, the potential for groundwater contamination, public health or safety problems, or other factors beyond the control of the applicant. No site shall be entitled to an exemption under this paragraph due solely to the size of the proposed land development activity in relation to the parcel size. However, the DPW shall provide special consideration in granting exemptions under this paragraph for the following sites: 
(i)  Redevelopment sites. 
(ii)  In-fill development areas less than 5 acres. 
(iii)  Highway projects where limited public right-of-way land is available for the installation of storm water BMPs. 
(iv)  Land developments with less than 10 percent of the proposed disturbed area planned to be connected impervious surfaces and the total cumulative area of all impervious areas is less than one acre using the final build-out condition. 
(2)  Application for Exemption . An exemption under subsection (1) above may only be granted by the DPW upon the applicant submitting the following items to the DPW, which shall constitute a completed application: 
a.  A written request describing the provisions of this subsection for which an exception is being requested and an explanation of why; 
b.  A site plan in accordance with subsection (c) above, including the delineation of the area and size (in acres) to which the exemption would apply and any other storm water BMPs required to meet this ordinance or as recommended in a regional storm water management plan; 
c.  The necessary technical documentation to demonstrate that the site meets one or more of the criteria for which an exemption is being applied, including documentation of the applicable provisions of any regional storm water management plan that may be involved; 
d.  For off-site BMP(s) under subsection (1)a. above: 
(i)  Documentation that the necessary BMP(s) have been properly installed, including as-built plans, construction certification and design summaries in accordance with §19.09(d); 
(ii)  A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement in accordance with §19.13, and any other easements or legal arrangement that may be involved to ensure the long-term maintenance of the off-site BMP(s); 
(iii)  Documentation of payment of any applicable fees that may be required by the City or other unit of government (such as the County, DOT, or special storm water plan district) charged with implementing a regional storm water management plan. 
e.  Other materials that the DPW determines to be necessary to make a determination under this subsection or to comply with this ordinance. 
(3)  Review Procedure . The DPW shall review all exemption application materials submitted under subsection (2) above to determine compliance with this section and notify the applicant of a decision within 60 working days of the submittal date, in accordance with the procedures under §19.08(f) above. The City Engineer shall approve all exemptions under subsection (1)c. above. 
(4)  Exemption Fee . For those sites that are exempted under (1)a.-c. above, and are not publicly funded, the applicant shall contribute funds to the DPW to be used exclusively for storm water BMP implementation or stream restoration expenses within the City. The amount of the payment shall be based on the average costs for the typical BMP(s) that would have been required on-site to comply with the requirements of this section had an exemption not been granted. The DPW shall publish a fee schedule for this purpose, to be updated as needed to reflect current BMP costs. 
(5)  Appeal . If the applicant does not agree with any determination of the DPW under this subsection, the applicant may appeal the decision pursuant to the procedures in §19.15(c). 
(f)  FINAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS. Final storm water management plans shall contain the following applicable items: 
(1)  Drafting date and contact information for the project engineer, with all other mapping elements and scale consistent with the site plan map; 
(2)  Location of existing and proposed storm water discharge points; 
(3)  Delineation and labeling of all proposed impervious areas and accompanying area computations; 
(4)  Final design drawings of all proposed storm water BMPs with unique references to support documentation, prepared in accordance with minimum City standards and of sufficient clarity for those responsible for site grading, including:

(7)  Location, dimensions and surfacing material or soils data of proposed access lanes and delineation of easements needed to allow future maintenance of all storm water BMPs in accordance with §19.13(b) below. The minimum width of any access easement shall be 15 feet; 
(8)  Location of soil borings and soil profile evaluations with surface elevations, seasonal high water elevations and unique references to supplemental data sheets, as needed to determine feasibility of any proposed storm water BMP and to comply with applicable technical standards; 
(9)  Detailed construction notes explaining all necessary procedures to be followed to properly implement the plan, including planting and landscaping specifications, timing and sequencing of construction and any temporary measures needed to protect BMPs during the construction phase; 
Note: Some BMPs, such as infiltration and bioretention practices, are susceptible to sedimentation and may need to be protected during construction or planned for construction later in the project sequence. 
(10)  A detailed storm water BMP construction inspection plan, outlining the critical elements in the plan that need to be surveyed or inspected by a representative appointed by the City Engineer, and the timing and notification requirements involved. 
Note: Examples of critical elements for a construction inspection plan include, but are not limited to checking subgrade elevations or the placement of footings, pipes or other structures prior to covering, soil testing, material inspections and final grade checks before seeding. Any inspection conducted by the representative appointed by the City Engineer does not waive the permit holder's responsibility for construction oversight and verification. 
(11)  A final storm water BMP maintenance agreement in accordance with §19.13; 
(12)  Support documentation summarized in accordance with City standards, including but not limited to: 
a.  A narrative summary of the storm water management plan, briefly explaining any unique information that led to the selection of BMPs, how the proposed plan meets the guiding principles under subsection (b) above, and the specific storm water planning requirements under subsection (d) above.

19A.01 - PURPOSE. 
The resources of several lakes have defined the City since early settlement. While the City has developed around and outward from the lakes, protection of the quality resources remains a top priority. Land uses within the original central city and surrounding areas along the lakes were developed to take advantage of the economic opportunities that resulted from their location near the resources and providing goods and services to the surrounding community. Changes in resource management and economics in and around the central city have necessitated an evaluation of the historic development pattern. Opportunities have been identified that will sustain the economic vitality of the central city and surrounding areas combined with increased protection of the resources. Development standards set in place to protect the resources applicable to new development would restrict the sustainable use of the previously built development, as much of the older parts of the City were divided into parcels and buildings constructed prior to the establishment of any local land use controls. To place the same standards on an area with over a century of history that applies to new development is not in the best interest of the general public. This chapter of the Municipal Code is created to allow redevelopment of parcels within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable waters within the city limits and to enhance the required standards to mitigate any impacts that may occur by way of the redevelopment in order to maintain and increase the useful resources of the lakes. 
19A.02 - APPLICABILITY. 
The standards within this chapter shall apply to all shoreland within the City of Oconomowoc. Shoreland is defined as all land within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable waters. 
19A.03 - DEFINITIONS. 
(1)  BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. "Best management practices," or "BMPs," means structural or nonstructural measures, practices, techniques or devices employed to avoid or minimize soil, sediment or pollutants carried in runoff to waters of the state. 
(2)  LAND DISTURBANCE. "Land disturbance" means any manmade alteration of the land surface resulting in a change in the topography or existing vegetative or nonvegetative soil cover that may result in runoff and lead to an increase in soil erosion and movement of sediment into waters of the state. Land disturbance includes clearing and grubbing, demolition, excavating, pit trench dewatering, filling and grading activities. 
(3)  REDEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to real estate including additions to, relocation of, or construction of buildings of other structures. 
19A.04 - APPROVAL PROCEDURE. 
The party proposing to redevelop within the shoreland area is hereby required to file a plan outlining the BMPs proposed to meet the shoreland water quality standards of this ordinance. The plan shall be filed with the City Engineer/Department of Public Works. Approval of the plan shall be granted by either the City Engineer or a representative of the Department of Public Works. 
19A.05 - WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. 
Any redevelopment in shoreland areas may be permitted, subject to the following shoreland water quality standards. The shoreland area of the City to which this ordinance applies is divided into 3 areas as set forth in the "Shoreland Water Quality Improvement Technical Memorandum" dated August 4, 2008, and on file in the office of the City Clerk, and any future amendments thereto, which memorandum is incorporated herein by reference. 
(1)  AREAS 1 AND 2. Within Areas 1 and 2, any redevelopment site or combination of sites if so planned for redevelopment concurrently, shall be designed to provide a minimum 50 percent reduction in sediment when compared to the existing developed conditions. The best management practices (BMPs) or combination of practices to accomplish the minimum 50 percent reduction shall be selected to achieve the best efficiency within the particular redevelopment site or sites, as alternative practices are identified in the "Shoreland Water Quality Improvement Technical Memorandum." The BMPs shall be designed and the plans stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Wisconsin, and shall be approved by the City Engineer. The approval of the design and implementation of the BMPs shall be required along with the approval of the site plan, architectural plans, or any other plans of the redevelopment site by the Common Council and Plan Commission as may be required by any other section of the Municipal Code. 
This water quality standard involves only the quality of surface water run-off. The regulation of the quantity of surface water run-off shall of conform to Chapter 19 of the Municipal Code-Stormwater Management and Erosion Control Ordinance, if applicable. 
This water quality standard shall apply only to the portion of the site or sites where redevelopment land disturbance as defined herein is planned. Any portion of a site or sites that remain unchanged from prior development shall not be required to be included in the calculation of the water quality standard. 
The City may (a) further regulate the continued maintenance of BMPs to ensure proper working order at all times, (b) require reimbursement for the design and/or construction of BMPs that serves more than one property, (c) coordinate cost share of BMPs that serves more than one property, or (d) set fees for regular City inspection of BMPs via the use of a developer's agreement or any other legal instrument allowed by Municipal Code or the statutes of the State of Wisconsin including, but not limited to, §66.0627, Wis. Stats. 
(2)  AREA 3. Within Area 3, any redevelopment site or combination of sites if so planned for redevelopment concurrently shall be designed to provide a minimum 40 percent reduction in sediment when compared to the existing developed condition. The BMPs or combination of BMPs to accomplish the minimum 40 percent reduction shall be selected to achieve the best efficiency within the particular redevelopment site or sites, as alternative practices are identified in the "Shoreland Water Quality Improvement Technical Memorandum." The BMPs shall be designed and the plans stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Wisconsin and shall be approved by the City Engineer. The approval of the design and implementation of the BMPs shall be required along with the approval of the site plan, architectural plans or any other plans of the redevelopment site by the Common Council and Plan Commission as may be required by any other section of the Municipal Code. 
This water quality standard involves only the quality of surface water run-off. The regulation of the quantity of surface water run-off shall conform to Chapter 19 of the Municipal Code-Stormwater Management and Erosion Control Ordinance, if applicable. 
This water quality standard shall apply only to the portion of the site or sites where redevelopment land disturbance as defined herein is planned. Any portion of a site or sites that remain unchanged from prior development shall not be required to be included in the calculation of the water quality standard. 
The City may (a) further regulate the continued maintenance of BMPs to ensure proper working order at all times, (b) require reimbursement for the design and/or construction of BMPs that serves more than one property, (c) coordinate cost share of BMPs that serves more than one property, or (d) set fees for regular City inspection of BMPs via the use of a developer's agreement or any other legal instrument allowed by Municipal Code or the statutes of the State of Wisconsin including, but not limited to, §66.0627, Wis. Stats.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 

20.11 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. 
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§61.35 and 62.23, [Wis. Stats.], for villages and cities; and the requirements in §87.30, [Wis.] Stats. 
20.12 - FINDING OF FACT. 
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers in the City of Oconomowoc would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
20.13 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
20.14 - TITLE. 
This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. 
20.15 - GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
(1)  AREAS TO BE REGULATED. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(2)  OFFICIAL MAPS AND REVISIONS. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see §20.80, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Planner/Zoning Administrator, City of Oconomowoc, WI. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(a)  Official Maps: (Rep. & recr. #14-O869) Based on the FIS: 
1.  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0038G; 55133C0039G; 55133C0131G; 55133C0132G; 55133C0133G; 55133C0134G; 55133C0151G; 55133C0152G; 55133C0153G; 55133C0154G; 55133C0161H all panels being dated November 5, 2014 with the corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated November 5, 2014, Volume number 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C, and 55133CV003C; Approved by the DNR and FEMA. 
2.  Waukesha County Flood Storage District Maps, Panels 1 and 7 of 12, dated November 5, 2014; Approved by the DNR. 
(b)  Official Maps: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development. 
(3)  ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN ZONING DISTRICTS. The regional floodplain areas are divided into 4 districts as follows: 
(a)  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(b)  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
(c)  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO Zones on the FIRM. 
(d)  The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(4)  LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in sub[section] (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §20.80, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to §20.73(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to §20.80, Amendments. 
(a)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(b)  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(5)  REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least 2 feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to §20.80, Amendments. 
(6)  COMPLIANCE. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, State, and Federal regulations. 
(7)  MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if §13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when §30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies. 
(8)  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. 
(a)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §§59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; §62.23 for cities; §61.35 for villages; or §87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(9)  INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(10)  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the City of Oconomowoc or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
(11)  SEVERABILITY. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(12)  ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES. The Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

(Am. #15-O881; #16-O904; #17-O925) 
(b)  The Water Facilities Impact Fee and the North Interceptor Impact Fee may be increased annually based upon the prior year's average interest rate for the Wisconsin Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP) rate. (Am. #15-O881) 
(2)  RESIDENTIAL/NONRESIDENTIAL - 3-INCH METER OR LARGER. 
(a)  Residential/nonresidential connections with a meter size of 3-inch or greater shall be calculated using the estimated water usage supplied by the owner/developer on the appropriate city form divided by the appropriate annualized gallons applicable (definitions §27.04(16)(a), (b) and (c)) to each of the fees in the ordinance to arrive at the number of RECs, and then multiplying the RECs times the appropriate fees in force at the time of calculation. 
1.  The property owner shall submit, on forms provided by the City, a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for a nonresidential development. 
2.  Based upon the information supplied by the property owner under subsection 1., the City shall calculate the number of RECs for that development by dividing the intended water use by the annualized amount as defined in definitions §27.04(16)(a), (b) or (c). All REC calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC. An interim fee shall be calculated by multiplying the calculated RECs by the fee schedule as in Table 1 above. 
3.  Since the impact fee determined under subsections 1. and 2., above, is based upon estimated intended usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for any 12-month period. At anytime between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of the nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to determine a highest actual recorded usage in any 12-month period. 
4.  Based upon the information obtained under subsection 3., above, the City shall recalculate the number of RECs and may recalculate the impact fee pursuant to subsection 2., above. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the original charge, the difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made by the current owner of the property.

(b)  Residential/Nonresidential Development - Meter Sizes 3-Inch and Larger . 
1.  The property owner shall submit, on forms provided by the City, a good faith estimation of the intended water and sewer usage for the residential/nonresidential redevelopment. Existing meter size equivalent flow for the current meter size in use up to 2 inches of the redevelopment site should then be deducted from the proposed intended usage to arrive at the basis for recalculation. If the current meter is 3 inches or larger, the existing use to be deducted shall be based on annual use history. 
2.  Based upon the information supplied by the property owner under subsection 1., the City shall calculate the number of RECs for that redevelopment by dividing the intended water use by the annualized amount as defined in definitions §27.04(16)(a), (b) or (c). All REC calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.5 REC. An interim fee shall be calculated by multiplying the calculated RECs by the fee schedule as in Table 1 above. 
3.  Since the impact fee determined under subsections 1. and 2., above, is based upon estimated intended usage, the City shall have the right to recalculate the charge based upon actual usage for any 12-month period. At any time between the first and third anniversary dates of establishment of a nonresidential account, the City may review the account history to determine the highest actual recorded usage in any 12-month period. 
4.  Based upon the information obtained under subsection 3., the City shall recalculate the number of RECs and may recalculate the impact fee pursuant to subsection 2., above. If the recalculated charge exceeds that of the original charge, the difference between the recalculated charge and the amount paid for the original charge shall become due and payable at the time the adjustment is made by the current owner of the property/development.

28.01 General Provisions 28.02 Application 28.03 Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission 28.04 Severability of Provision 28.05 Violations and Penalties  

28.01 - GENERAL PROVISIONS . (Cr. #03-0567) 
(1)  FINDINGS AND NECESSITY. The City of Oconomowoc and the Town of Summit find that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within the City and the Town is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the area, its citizens and businesses, and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer system operations of the area by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary sewer system. In addition, surface water runoff may create erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences with water damage, and create environmental damage to the lakes, streams and other water bodies within and adjacent to the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District. Surface water runoff, if not controlled, will impact not only on the aforementioned lakes and streams and other water bodies, but will also degrade the groundwater within the District and in areas adjacent thereto. The cost of operating and maintaining the Pabst Farms joint stormwater management system and financing the necessary repairs, replacements, improvements, and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the impact on and services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the City and the Town hereby exercise their respective authorities to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services. 
(2)  AUTHORITY. This ordinance is adopted under the authority granted by Chs. 60, 62 and 66, Wis. Stats., including, but not limited to, the following sections: §60.627, §62.11(5), §62.16, §62.175, §62.18, §66.0627, §66.0809, §66.0811, and §66.0821. 
(3)  ESTABLISHMENT. 
(a)  There is hereby established the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater Utility. The operation of the stormwater utility shall be under the supervision of the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission. 
(b)  The City and the Town have contracted to enact this ordinance as a uniform method of regulation of surface water management throughout the District. The municipalities will enact the ordinance as a regulatory ordinance applicable to the area of each municipality that falls within the legally defined District. 
(4)  COMMISSION AUTHORITY. The Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission, through the Stormwater Utility, may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance such facilities as are deemed by the Commission to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system and storm and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation by enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, water courses, retaining walls and ponds, and such other facilities as will support a stormwater management system. 
(5)  INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT ADOPTED BY REFERENCE. 
(a)  The Intergovernmental Agreement entered into by the Town and the City attached hereto as Exhibit A (hereinafter the "Intergovernmental Agreement"), and all future modifications and amendments thereto, are hereby adopted by reference as though set forth in full in this ordinance. 
(b)  Those property owners to whom this ordinance applies are required to comply with the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement. A violation of or failure to comply with any provision of said Agreement shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance No. 03-0567. 
28.02 - APPLICATION . (Cr. #03-0567)

(2)  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND FACILITIES REQUIRED. No owner of property within the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District shall proceed with any development or redevelopment, or with the final division of property for residential purposes by means of platting or certified survey map, unless said property owner has submitted to and has received approval of a site-specific stormwater management plan by the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission. Property owners developing, redeveloping or dividing property shall also comply with the District regulations as defined in the Intergovernmental Agreement. 
(3)  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. No property owner shall undertake a land development, redevelopment or final residential property division activity subject to the requirements of this ordinance without first receiving a permit from the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission. 
(4)  APPLICATION AND FEE. Permit applications shall be made on a form provided by the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission. The application must be accompanied by the site-specific stormwater management plan required under the provisions of this ordinance and District regulations and a nonrefundable permit administration fee in an amount as from time to time established by the Commission. 
(5)  PERMIT COMPLIANCE. No construction as defined in the Intergovernmental Agreement shall be undertaken prior to the issuance of a permit by the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission, and all construction must be performed according to the approved site-specific stormwater management plan. 
28.03 - PABST FARMS JOINT STORMWATER DISTRICT COMMISSION . (Cr. #03-0567) 
(1)  CREATION OF THE COMMISSION. The parties have established a Commission, known as the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission, by the Intergovernmental Agreement. 
(2)  COMPOSITION. The composition of the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission, the authority of the Commission, and the method of operation by the Commission shall be as set forth in the Intergovernmental Agreement. 
28.04 - SEVERABILITY OF PROVISION . (Cr. #03-0567) 
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by reason of any decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of any other section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase, or portion thereof. 
28.05 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES . (Cr. #03-0567)

Each day a condition is allowed to exist which is contrary to all or any part of this ordinance, including the Intergovernmental Agreement adopted by reference herein, shall constitute a separate violation. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises delinquent under the provisions of this ordinance shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating charges due and penalties for violations. 
(2)  In addition to the court proceedings and penalties described in the foregoing subsection of this ordinance, whenever a person violates any provision of said ordinance or fails to comply with any order of the City, Town, or the Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District Commission, the City, Town or Commission may order that an action be commenced on behalf of the City, Town or Commission in the County Court for Waukesha County for the purpose of obtaining an injunction restraining the person violating this ordinance or failing to comply with the order, from further violating this ordinance, or any rule or regulation of the Commission.

(c) When any highway or public ground acquired or held for highway purposes is discontinued, the land where the highway or public ground is located shall belong to the owner or owners of the adjoining lands and shall be construed to be the same zoning district as the lots. If the highway or public ground is located between the lands of different owners, it shall be attached to the lots to which it originally belonged if that can be ascertained. If the lots to which the land originally belonged cannot be ascertained, the land shall be equally divided between the owners of the lands on each side of the highway or public ground.
(d) Where any uncertainty exists as to the exact location of zoning district boundary lines, the Zoning Board of Appeals, upon written application, shall determine the location of such boundary lines.
Section 17.104 Residential Districts
(1) General purposes of all residential zoning districts: The residential zoning districts are intended to:
(a) Provide appropriately located areas for residential development that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and with standards for public health, safety, and general welfare;
(b) Ensure adequate light, air, and privacy for all dwelling units with respect to density;
(c) Minimize traffic congestion and overloading of public services and utilities;
(d) Protect residential neighborhoods from incompatible uses that create excessive noise, illumination, unsightliness, odor, and smoke; and
(e) Create a mixture of residential uses and preserve edges and transitions between districts.
(2) Rural Residential (RR): The RR zone is intended for development of housing at a target density of 1.0 dwelling units per gross acre. Detached single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
(3) Suburban Residential (SR): The SR zone is intended for development of housing at a target density of 3.0 dwelling units per gross acre. Detached single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
(4) Traditional Residential (TR): The TR zone is intended for development of housing at a target density of 6.0 dwelling units per gross acre. Detached single-family housing will be the predominant housing type in this zone.
(5) Multi-Unit (Low) Residential (RML): The RML zone is intended for development of housing at a target density of 8.0 dwelling units per gross acre. Small lot single-family housing, duplexes, attached dwellings and multi-dwelling residences will be permitted housing types, subject to the density limitations of the zone
(6) Multi-Unit (High) Residential (RMH): The RMH zone is intended for development at a target density of 12.0 dwelling units per gross acre. Multi-unit residential buildings will be the predominant housing type in this zone. RMH zoning is generally applied near heavily traveled roadways and adjacent to commercial districts.

Page 9
Updated 7/15/20
(7) Isthmus Residential Multi (IRM): The IRM zone is intended for development at a target density of 10.0 dwelling units per gross acre. The IRM zone is applied in the isthmus between Fowler Lake and Lac la Belle.
(8) Isthmus Residential Single (IRS): The IRS zone is intended for development at a target density of 5.0 dwelling units per gross acre. IRS zone is applied in the isthmus between Fowler and Lac la Belle, and north of the North Lake Road bridge.
Section 17.105 Non-Residential and Other Districts
(1) General purposes of all non-residential and other districts: The non-residential and other zoning districts are intended to:
(a) Provide appropriately located areas consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for retail, service, office, and industrial uses;
(b) Strengthen the Citys economic base and provide employment opportunities close to home for residents of the City and surrounding communities;
(c) Provide parks, open space, and other public facilities that serve the needs of the community; and
(d) Minimize any negative impact of nonresidential development on adjacent residential districts.
(2) General Commercial (GC): The GC zone is established to provide for shopping, service and office facilities adjacent to heavily traveled roadways. This district is intended to meet the convenience shopping and service needs of City residents and attract people from surrounding communities.
(3) Mixed-Use Commercial (MC): The MC zone is established to promote a concentration of mixed uses including retail, service, office, and residential uses. The location, mix and configuration of land uses are designed to encourage convenient alternatives to the automobile, safe and attractive streetscape, and a more livable community.
(4) Business Park (BP): The BP zone is intended for a broad range of office, light industrial uses and other complimentary uses that promote high quality new development. The purpose of this district is to permit a variety of uses that will provide professional employment within the City while at the same time providing personal and professional services to the employees working within this zoning district.
(5) Industrial (I): The I zone is intended for industrial uses that are generally not compatible with residential development because of their operational characteristics. This district is also intended for uses that may require outdoor areas to conduct business activities or for product storage or display. The purpose of this district is to permit the normal operations of any industry that can meet and maintain compliance with established State and Federal performance standards.
(6) Urban Reserve (UR): (Amended Ordinance No. 16-O887  adopted 2/2/16) The district is intended to provide a transition between surrounding Town agricultural/rural residential areas on large parcels of land at a low rate of population density. This district also serves as a holding zone for recently attached
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 10
Updated 7/15/20
or annexed properties to the City until the property is rezoned to a different zoning district. The City will not issue building permits for new single-family residential dwelling units on parcels over 10 acres in size within the UR, Urban Reserve Zoning District, unless the property owner prepares an overall site development plan for the property and strategically places the dwelling on a future lot per the site development plan. The site development plan shall include the conceptual layout of future lots, streets, access points, utility lines and significant environmental features. Sewer and water supply shall be extended to serve the proposed dwelling and the location thereof shall be based on the future lot layout. All City fees regarding public infrastructure needed to serve the proposed dwelling, including any outstanding special assessments or capital cost recovery charges, are required to be paid by the owner at time of permit. All easements requested by the City shall be granted at no cost by the property owner prior to release of building permit. No more than one dwelling will be allowed on each UR zoned parcel, until the property is rezoned and developed in accordance with the Citys Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
(7) Institutional/Public (IP): The IP Zone is intended to serve larger institutional facilities such as churches, campus, school sites and associated playgrounds, hospitals, sewer and water treatment facilities, and cemeteries. The district is for uses such as governmental services, education facilities, public parks, open space, and similar activities.
Section 17.106 Table of Allowed Uses
The Table below lists the uses allowed within all zoning districts. All uses are defined within this Zoning Ordinance. Approval of a use listed within this Table, and compliance with the applicable specific standards for use types, authorize that use only. Development or use of a property for any other use not specifically allowed in this Table and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited.
(1) Explanation of table abbreviations:
(a) Permitted By-Right Uses: P in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district subject to all other applicable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance including the specific standards for use types.
(b) Conditional Uses: C in a cell indicates that, in the respective zoning district, the use is allowed only if reviewed and approved with conditions in accordance with the procedures and applicable regulations of this Ordinance.
(c) Prohibited Uses: A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district.
(2) Table Organization: The Table of Allowed Uses classifies land uses and activities into general use categories and specific use types based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. This classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. This classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories and
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 11
Updated 7/15/20
specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories. The use categories are intended merely as an indexing tool and are not regulatory.
(3) Classification of new and unlisted uses: The City recognizes that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated in the Zoning Ordinance may seek to locate in the City. When application is made for a use type that is not specifically listed in the Table of Allowed Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall make a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use in the following manner:
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall provide an interpretation as to the zoning district into which such use should be placed. In making such interpretation, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage and amount, and nature thereof, enclosed or open storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material, and vibration likely to be generated, and the general requirements for public utilities such as water, sanitary sewer and electrical.
(b) Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use.
(c) Appeals of the Zoning Administrators decision shall be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals following the procedures of this Ordinance.

Section 17.115 Municipal Well Recharge Area (MW) Overlay Zoning District
The City recognizes that consequences of certain land use activities, whether intentional or accidental, can seriously impair groundwater quality. The purpose of the Municipal Well Recharge Area Overlay District (MW) is to protect municipal groundwater resources from certain land use activities by imposing appropriate restrictions upon lands located within the approximate groundwater recharge area of the Citys municipal wells. The restrictions imposed herein are in addition to those of the underlying zoning districts or any other provisions of the zoning Chapter.
(1) MW Overlay Zones: The Municipal Well Recharge Area Overlay District is indicated by MW on the Well Recharge Area Map. The MW zone is identified as the primary source of water for the municipal well aquifer and as the area most likely to transmit groundwater contaminants to the municipal wells. Each required municipal well shall have a MW zone defined by a Wellhead Protection Plan (WHPP). The MW zone to be protected shall encompass the recharge area equivalent to a five (5) year time of travel or 1,200 feet at a minimum.
(2) Map: The locations and boundaries of the Recharge Area Overlay Zoning District established by this Chapter are set forth on the adopted Well Recharge Area Map.
(3) MW Land Use Regulations: The following land use regulations are in addition to the land use regulations established by the basic Zoning District(s) provided by the remainder of this Chapter:
(4) Separation Distance Requirements: Potential sources of contamination shall be physically separated from municipal wells subject to the MW Recharge Overlay Districts. The separation distances as specified in Chapter NR section 811of the Wisconsin Administrative Code shall be maintained.

SUBCHAPTER 17-2: Performance Standards
Section 17.200 Intensity and Bulk Requirements
All primary and accessory structures are subject to the dimensional, bulk and performance standards set forth within this Section. These general standards may be further limited or modified by other applicable sections of this Zoning Ordinance.
Section 17.201 Measurements and Exceptions
(1) Density:
(a) Residential Densities: The City regulates residential development primarily by density rather than minimum lot size. Density is calculated based on gross acres. Within the density limits of each residential district, a variety of housing types and lot sizes are permitted. This approach allows more sites to be developed with flexibility.
(b) Dwelling Units Allowed: The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards of this Zoning Ordinance shall be met. The maximum density established for a Zoning District is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor valid justification for varying or modifying other dimensional or development standards.
(2) Setbacks:
(a) A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements for the Zoning District in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this Zoning Ordinance or unless a variance, special exception, or other modification has been granted. Setbacks shall be measured from the property line.
(b) Setbacks shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from 30-inches above grade upward; provided, however, that fences, non-structural walls, trellises, poles, posts, ornaments, furniture, and other customary yard accessories may be permitted in any setback subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility.
(3) Projections into Required Setbacks, General  The following structures may project into required front, side, or rear setbacks as specified in this Section:
(a) Paved Terraces: Paved terraces may project into any required setback, provided that no structures placed there shall violate other requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and are at least five (5) feet from the lot line.
(b) Unroofed Landings, Decks, Stairs and Balconies: Unroofed landing, decks, and stairs may project into required setbacks, provided that no portion other than a handrail shall extend higher than 30-inches above the finished grade level. Unroofed landings, decks, and stairs greater than 30-inches may project into the required side or rear yard provided these projections are at least five (5) feet from the property line. Unroofed balconies may project into a required side or rear yard provided these projections are at least five (5) feet from the property line.

(i) Charging Stations: Electric vehicle charging stations may be located within required front or side setbacks, and shall not be located closer than five (5) feet to any property line.
(4) Projections into Required Shoreland Setbacks: The following may project into required shoreland setbacks as specified by this Section provided the intrusion is constructed and maintained in a manner that avoids or minimizes adverse impacts to the shoreline:
(a) Pedestrian walkways, provided the amount of impervious surface is the minimum reasonably necessary to provide access to the shoreline.
(b) Facilities for public access to the water and public water-enjoyment recreational uses.
(c) Utilities which are located underground and are accessory to shoreline use.
(d) Bio-retention swales, rain gardens, and other similar bio-retention systems that allow filtration of water through vegetation.

(c) Projections into setbacks shall not be included in averaging.
(d) Setback reductions approved by variance or special exception shall not be included.
(e) If a block face is at least seventy-five (75%) built, a vacant lot on the block face shall not be included.
(6) Double-Frontage Lots: In the case of double-frontage lots, front yard setbacks shall be provided on all street frontages. Accessory structure construction is permitted on the non-driveway street frontage provided front/street yard setbacks are met.
(7) Building Height:
(a) Height Requirements: No building shall be erected or altered that will exceed the height limit for the respective Zoning District.
(b) Height Exceptions for Appurtenances: The height limitations contained in this Zoning Code do not apply to cupolas, flagpoles, spires, church belfries, chimneys, solar energy equipment, antennas, heating and ventilation equipment, stairwell towers or similar appurtenances, provided, however, the following:

Screening for rooftop mechanical equipment shall incorporate similar architectural features of
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 40
Updated 7/15/20
the building and/or constructed of a material and color compatible with other elements of the building. Exterior mechanical equipment, such as ductwork, shall not be located on primary building facades, unless approved by the City.
Section 17.207 Commercial and Mixed-Use Design Standards
This section is intended to promote high-quality commercial and mixed-use building design, encourage visual variety in non-residential areas of the City, foster a more pedestrian scale and attractive street fronts, project a positive image to encourage economic development in the City, and protect property values of both the subject property and surrounding areas. Development of any structure that will contain a commercial use shall comply with the general standards of this Section.
(1) Sitting: The sitting of the building shall:
(a) Reflect, rather than obscure natural topography.
(b) Enable significant or important trees to be preserved as determined by the City Planner.
(c) Be compatible with the original structure, when the structure is an addition to an existing structure.
(2) Building Orientation: Local climatic conditions shall be considered when orienting buildings. For example, north-facing facades are especially susceptible to winter snow and ice accumulation, and entries may require special treatment. Snow piling zones along street shall be considered in arranging building elements on the site. Adequate solar access shall be considered when planning outdoor spaces, with shade and relief from glare provided by landscaping and overhead structures.
(3) Street Corners: Buildings located on street corners shall recognize the importance of their location by:
(a) Concentrating tallest portions of the building at the intersection where they may frame the corner;
(b) Employing architectural features, such as angled façades, prominent entrances, a stepped parapet wall, or other unique building features at the corner; or
(c) Employing a similar technique as approved by the Zoning Administrator.
(4) Pedestrian Environment:
(a) Site design shall locate pedestrian routes connecting residential, recreational, and commercial uses to minimize contact with normal vehicular traffic. This can be achieved by designing crossings at traffic stop points, and/or by announcing crossings with signage, pavement changes, and landscape features.
(b) Pedestrian use can be increased by the addition of amenities such as benches, drinking fountains, planters, trash receptacles, path lighting, and bicycle racks.
(c) When existing sidewalks, curbs, gutters, or other public improvements have deteriorated, the development shall be required to replace and/or repair the public amenities.
(d) When sidewalks exist or are proposed, new development should be sited and designed to encourage pedestrian activity.
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 41
Updated 7/15/20
(5) Building Massing and Form: Unless otherwise provided in this Zoning Ordinance, building form may vary widely, as long as certain features of building form are considered:
(a) Within the development, variability in size and shape of buildings shall occur.
(b) Incorporating pedestrian-scale features at the ground level will help encourage pedestrian use. Examples include articulated entries and window canopies, arcades, recessed entries, changes in color, material, or texture.
(c) Façade modulation shall be utilized to reduce the apparent bulk of a large building, where applicable.
(d) Large, unbroken expanses and long, continuous rooflines shall be avoided.
(6) Building Materials:
(a) A wide range of exterior building materials is acceptable, including but not limited to wood, brick and stone. Materials appearing to derive from local natural settings are encouraged.
(b) Metal-sided buildings are prohibited, except concealed fasteners, pre-finished metal, and architectural metal panels. Metal roofing is acceptable. Metal wainscot treatments not exceeding four (4) feet in height are acceptable.
(7) Architectural Style: The architectural character of new buildings or additions shall complement the architectural character of adjacent existing buildings.
(8) Four-Sided Design: All building façades shall be designed with a similar level of design detail. Blank walls void of architectural detailing shall not be permitted. Exceptions may be granted in those areas of the building envelope that the applicant can demonstrate are not visible from adjacent development, public rights-of-way, trails, lakes, etc.
(9) Entrance Visibility: Entrances shall be clearly delineated and visible from the street.
(a) Buildings should be designed with delineated and unobstructed entries accessible from adjacent streets, as opposed to entries accessible only from parking lots.
(b) When entries cannot be located adjacent to the street, delineated and unobstructed pathways using building and landscape elements should enhance building entries.

Section 17.208 Downtown Design Overlay District (Ord. No. 17-O929)
(Adopted January 16, 2018) The Downtown Design Overlay District is created to foster excellence in the design of the built environment in the Downtown. Architectural design of projects within the District should fit comfortably within the existing fabric of the City and stand the test of time by remaining functional and ageless over a period of many years. Design standards shall address the quality of architecture, urban design, and public space to ensure the success of the project and for the benefit of the community. The main value and purpose of the Downtown Design Overlay District is to provide clarity and focus on the design of Downtown projects, consistent with the purposes stated herein. New development should be sympathetic to Oconomowocs Downtown Design purposes and goals. Although a development may be larger or taller than that seen historically or incorporate contemporary design elements and materials, it should also reflect the design context, appropriate massing and traditions of its character of the blocks and streets on which it is located.
The purposes and goals of the Downtown Design Overlay District are intended to provide context and guidance for the Architectural Commission in their consideration of discussing and recommending conditions to ensure an attractive, vibrant and sustainable downtown area on a project-by-project basis.
17.208 (2) Application of the Downtown Design Standards:
The Downtown Design Overlay District has been further subdivided into nine (9) separate areas as depicted on the two different Downtown Design Overlay District Maps:
? East St. Paul Street Area
? North Pleasant Street Area
? East Wisconsin Avenue Area
? West Wisconsin Avenue Area
? West Worthington Street Area
? East Concord Road Area
? Walnut Street Area
? West Lapham Street Area

Ordinance and Architectural Building Review Process. Change of property use, change of property ownership, façade amendments, remodeling, minor additions (less than 5000 SF) and general maintenance of the existing buildings are projects not applicable to these standards. These regulations are intended to preserve and enhance the unique character and identity of Downtown Oconomowoc and ensure that future infill and redevelopment is consistent with City Plans. A high-quality appearance will be achieved through requirements for context-sensitive site layouts, architectural detailing, contextual massing, façade articulation, and other features designed to provide a more distinct character and pedestrian scale. Development of any applicable structure that is located within the Downtown Design Overlay District shall comply with the standards of this Section.
Projects will be reviewed by the Architectural Commission, whose members shall approve or deny the proposed design in relation to the established Design Standards. Such review is mandatory as part of the Citys normal architectural review process and compliance with the Architectural Commissions findings is also mandatory.
17.208 (3) General Site Design Standards:
(a) Urban Pattern & Form  All new construction and / or additions, must preserve the historic integrity of the Downtown area by complementing other instances of similar development which are consistent with the historic theme.
(b) Ground Floor Uses  The incorporation of retail shops and/or restaurants is encouraged at the street level to promote a more active environment for pedestrians and to support residential and office uses located within the same building or nearby. This configuration of uses is particularly encouraged along Wisconsin Avenue and Main Street, where a high level of activity and visibility is desirable.
(c) Curb Cut Openings  Along Wisconsin Avenue or Main Street, no new net gain in curb cuts are allowed for any new development. The City will allow existing curb cuts to be closed, relocated or reconfigured.
(d) Open Space  Each development shall include a minimum of 10% of public or private open space on the property. Open space can include public and private courtyards, plazas, patios, terraces, alleys, community gardens, rain gardens, green roofs and bio-swales. Open spaces should have an urban quality and character that enliven the street and enhance the pedestrian experience. Private property open space should be sized relative to the intended use and level of anticipated adjacent pedestrian activity. Open spaces shall be designed to maximize activity and usability for a diverse population of different abilities.
(e) Parking  All new residential shall be required to install a minimum of (1) on-site parking stall for each (1) bedroom or efficiency units and (2) on-site parking stalls for each (2) bedroom or greater units. Guest parking shall be an additional 0.25 stall per residential unit. Surface parking is encouraged behind buildings. Surface parking is discouraged between the building and primary street frontage. Design standards for properties and development located on Fowler Lake and Lac La Belle will be reviewed by the Plan Commission and Architectural Commission on a case-by-case basis.
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 45
Updated 7/15/20
(f) Pedestrian Connections  Pedestrian connections include sidewalks, alleys and arcades that provide pedestrian access within, through and among properties. Such connections provide access to buildings, courtyards, plazas and other site elements, and all projects should consider such connections.
(g) Primary Entrances  Primary entrances shall be orientated to the primary street frontage.
17.208 (4) General Building Design Standards:
(a) Four-Sided Architecture  All new construction shall have four-sided architecture. If the proposed building has common walls with adjacent buildings, only the exposed building walls are required to contain four-sided architecture. This is defined as having the same level of detail and materials used on all four sides of the buildings. In unique circumstances, the Citys Architectural Commission may waive the requirement if the site allows for less detail on one or more sides of the building.
(b) Building Massing & Articulation  The perceived mass and scale of downtown development shall be reduced at the ground level to achieve a pedestrian scale. This shall be accomplished by incorporating a series of human scale design elements that are consistent with the developments architectural character. Appropriate design elements for every development shall incorporate, but are not limited to, at least four (4) of the following:
1. Variations in roof form and parapet heights;
2. Pronounced recesses and projections;
3. Wall plane off-sets;
4. Off-sets to accommodate outdoor gathering spaces;
5. Distinct changes in texture and color of wall surfaces;
6. Ground-level arcades and second or third floor galleries / balconies;
7. Protected and recessed entries; and
8. Vertical accents or focal points.
(c) Building Setback  There shall be a 0 lot line setback unless noted.
(d) Building Stepback  Step taller buildings away from adjacent lower-scale buildings. All buildings taller than 30 shall incorporate a stepback of a minimum of 5 at the 30 or lower building height level. Buildings with an overall height of 50 or greater shall incorporate a minimum of one 5 stepback in the first 30 and a second 10 stepback thereafter.
(e) Transparency  A high level of ground floor transparency is encouraged throughout the Downtown. Dark, frosted or tinted glass in ground floor windows facing the street or an open space are prohibited, unless specific proposed uses justify inclusion of these features. Unless waived by the Architectural Commission, a minimum percentage of the total area of each ground-floor shall consist of transparency areas.
(f) Street Edge  Unique building elements and architectural details used at the street level are encouraged so as to create a direct impact on the quality of the pedestrian experience resulting in an active and interesting street front.
(g) Vision Corners  Vision corners shall be preserved at all street intersections. No buildings or significant structures are allowed with the triangle space of 15 x 15, measured along the property lines of the two street frontages.
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 46
Updated 7/15/20
(h) Entries  Entries shall be located to enhance the street level experience and help give a sense of human scale. Entries shall be clearly defined, accessible, and located to express visual interest along a street front.
(i) Windows  Buildings should be designed to incorporate ground floor storefront windows wherever possible. Windows shall be taller than they are wide.
(j) Canopies / Awnings  First floor canopies shall be designed as integral elements of the building façade. Material, configuration, dimension, and location of awnings shall be appropriate for the building. A canopy may extend up to 12 beyond the building to which it is affixed; however, is shall not extend closer than 1 to the vertical plane formed by the curb line. Canopies may extend into the public right-of-way and shall have a minimum clearance height of 8 from the pavement or sidewalk grade.
(k) Materials  Primary building materials shall be durable and project an image of permanence typical of the Downtown traditional masonry storefronts. Appropriate materials include, but are not limited to:
? Brick, stone, or other masonry products;
? Steel (may be used for accents only);
? Cast Concrete;
? Split face concrete masonry (not to exceed 40% of the exterior wall area);
? Composite siding; or
? Comparable material approved by the Architectural Commission.
? No veneer man-made stone, or vinyl materials will be allowed.
? No metal siding as the dominant form of building material.
(l) Mechanicals / Operational Systems  These elements must be screened with architectural screening materials or incorporate into the overall building design
(m) Sustainability  Design should encourage use of energy saving materials and construction practices, provide for sustainability when selecting structural and façade materials and designing functional building elements and incorporate building elements that allow for natural environmental control such as, operable windows for natural ventilation, wind locks at high volume entries, rain gardens, roof top gardens, sun shading and interior solar screens above south facing windows. Developers are also encouraged to utilize high efficiency lighting, appliances, and fixtures as well as selecting low-emitting materials.
(n) Garbage / Dumpsters / Enclosures  The development is responsible for its own garbage / recycling. It is strongly encouraged to have garbage / recycling located in underground parking areas. If the dumpsters are stored on the exterior of the building, enclosures are required and shall be made of the same architectural materials as the main building and be appropriately incorporated into the overall site design.
(o) Architectural Significant Feature  Buildings shall contain architectural significant features at specific areas as shown on the Overlay Map. These features are defined as an eye-catching focal point element, unique to the building design. They are located in dominate view sheds and enhance the appearance of the building close-up and from afar. Examples include significant differences in design, massing, building heights, materials, roof pitches or other similar qualities. The elements are subject to the Architectural Commission approval.

(3) Schedule C: Uses that reference Schedule C have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking and loading standard. Upon receiving an application for a use subject to Schedule C standards, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specific for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Zoning Administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from users or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
(4) Maximum Number of Spaces Permitted: For any use categorized as Commercial or Industrial in the Off Street Parking Requirements table, off-street parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount that is more than 125 percent of the minimum requirements established in this Ordinance. Exceptions to this requirement includes:
(a) If application of the maximum parking standard would result in less than six (6) parking spaces, the development shall be allowed six (6) parking spaces.
(b) For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the following types of parking spaces shall not count against the maximum parking requirements, but shall count toward the minimum requirement:
1. Accessible parking
2. Vanpool and carpool parking
3. Structured parking, underground parking, and parking within, above, or beneath the building(s) it serves.
(c) Exceptions to the maximum parking requirements may be allowed in situations that meet all of the following criteria as determined by the Zoning Administrator:
1. The proposed development has unique or unusual characteristics such as high sales volume per floor area or low parking turnover, which create a
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 65
Updated 7/15/20
parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and which typically does not apply to comparable uses.
2. The parking demand cannot be accommodated by on-street parking, shared parking with nearby uses, or by increasing the supply of spaces that are exempt from the maximum ratio.
3. The request is the minimum necessary variation from the standards.
4. If located in a mixed-use development, the uses in the proposed development and the site design are highly supportive of the mixed-use concept and support high levels of existing or planned transit and pedestrian activity.
5. Phased construction of parking areas that exceed the maximum parking requirements is encouraged to ensure the maximum amount of parking necessary is constructed.
(5) Computation of Parking and Loading Requirements:
(a) Fractions: When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
(b) Multiple Uses: Lots containing more than one (1) use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
(c) Area Measurements: Unless otherwise specified, all square footage-based parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area of the use in question. Structured parking within a building shall not be counted in such measurement.
(d) Computation of Off-Street Parking: Required off-street loading space shall not be included as off-street parking space computation of required off-street parking space.
(e) Parking for Unlisted Uses: Parking requirements for uses not specifically listed within this Section shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator based on the requirements for the closest comparable use, as well as on the particular parking demand and trip generation characteristics of the proposed use. The Zoning Administrator may alternatively require the submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.
(6) Parking Area Layout and Design:
(a) Stall Dimensions
1. Parking stall and aisle dimensions shall be measured from the middle of the stall stripe of a parking stall to the middle of the adjacent stall stripe.
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 66
Updated 7/15/20
Aisles for two-way flows shall be a minimum of 24 feet, except when no spaces are backing onto the aisle, in which case the width shall be 20 feet.
2. Accessible parking shall comply with the requirements of the International Building Code.
3. The following standards may be used as guidelines for the design of indoor and outdoor parking stalls. Deviations from these standards may be approved by the Zoning Administrator on a case-by-case basis:

Page 67
Updated 7/15/20
vehicles must maintain continuous circulation patterns, with no dead-ends, and safe access to public streets.
(e) Lighting and Maintenance: All parking area lighting shall comply with the Citys lighting requirements and provide adequate lighting for safety if night use is intended. Parking lots should provide adequate security and should limit visual clutter, parking lot signs, and equipment.
(f) Loading Areas: The City requires all new and substantially remodeled commercial and industrial developments to provide adequate loading zones. The loading zones must be illustrated on the site plan submitted for approval. Loading areas shall not impede major roads, highways, intersections, or other paths of travel. These zones must be located away from areas where there is heavy pedestrian travel unless such areas cannot be avoided.
(g) Paved Surface Setback: On a case-by-case basis, the Zoning Administrator may waive the minimum paved surface setback.
(7) Parking Alternatives: The Zoning Administrator may approve alternatives to providing the number off-street parking spaces in accordance with the following standards:
(a) Shared Parking: The Zoning Administrator may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with all of the following standards:
1. Location: Every shared parking space shall be located no farther than an appropriate distance as determined by the Zoning Administrator from the entrance to each building for which the shared parking is provided.
2. Zoning Classification: Shared parking areas shall be located on a site with the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the primary uses served.
3. Shared Parking Study: Those proposing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a shared parking analysis to the City that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, location of required parking, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. The application shall also demonstrate that any parking reduction requested as part of the shared parking study will not result in the spillover of parking onto other properties.
4. Agreement for Shared Parking: The parties involved in the joint use of off-street parking facilities shall submit a written agreement in a form to be recorded for such joint use, approved by the City Attorney. The agreement shall provide for the maintenance of jointly used facilities. The Zoning Administrator may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an agreement. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 68
Updated 7/15/20
of a building permit for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
(b) Off-Site Parking: The Zoning Administrator may approve the location of required off-street parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the following standards:
1. Location: No off-site parking space may be located more than an appropriate distance as determined by the Zoning Administrator from an entrance to the use being served. Off-site parking spaces shall be connected to the use by acceptable pedestrian facilities.

2. Control of Site: Required parking spaces for residential uses must be located on the site of the use or within a tract owned in common by all the owners of the properties that will use the tract.
3. Ineligible Activities: Required parking spaces for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site.
4. Agreement for Off-Site Parking: In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal land use served, a written agreement between the recorded owners shall be required, approved by the City Attorney. The agreement shall guarantee the use of the off-site parking area for a minimum period as determined by the City. The Zoning Administrator may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an agreement. A copy of the agreement between the owners of record shall be submitted to the County for recordation in a form acceptable by the City Attorney. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
(c) District Parking: Minimum required off-street parking spaces may be waived by the Zoning Administrator or reduced for properties within the boundaries of a public parking area that provides district-wide parking facilities, based on the projected parking demand to be addressed by the district-wide facility.
(d) Stacked, Tandem, and Valet Parking: Stacked, tandem, or valet parking for nonresidential uses is allowed if an attendant is present to move vehicles. In addition, a guarantee acceptable to the City shall be filed with the City ensuring that a valet parking attendant shall always be on duty when the parking lot is in

Page 69
Updated 7/15/20
operation. For residential uses, tandem or stacked vehicle parking may be allowed.
(e) Structured Parking:
1. Maximum Parking Waiver: Where 50 percent or more of the parking accessory to a use is in structured parking, there shall be no maximum cap on the number of parking spaces.
2. Density Bonus for Structured Parking in the Mixed-Use District: A density bonus shall be granted for underground parking structures in the mixed-use district. The bonus shall be granted at a ratio of 0.1 du/gross acre of additional bonus density for each structured parking space.
(8) Adjustments to Required Parking: The purpose of this section is to allow adjustments to the minimum number of parking spaces required to avoid constructing unneeded and excessive off-street parking facilities. Reducing the amount of excess off-street parking facilities is intended to provide for more cost efficient site development, to eliminate constructing more impervious surface than necessary, to minimize stormwater runoff, to avoid construction of unnecessarily large stormwater management facilities, and to provide more landscape areas and open space on sites. The total requirement for off-street parking may be reduced as part of the development approval by the Plan Commission as outlined below:
(a) All uses are eligible for a 20 percent parking reduction if the applicant can prove the reduced parking will not negatively impact the health, safety and welfare of persons utilizing the development and the surrounding neighborhood.
(b) The applicant shall submit a study providing an accurate reflection of parking demand for the development. Included in this study shall be alternatives including shared parking, bicycle parking, and pedestrian connections to the development.
(9) Interior Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements: The purpose of interior parking lot landscaping is to improve the appearance of parking lots, provide shade, and improve stormwater infiltration. All parking lots with twenty (20) or more parking spaces shall be landscaped in accordance with the following interior parking lot standards:
(a) A minimum of five percent (5%) of the asphalt or concrete area of the parking lot shall be devoted to interior planting islands or peninsulas. The planting islands shall contain a minimum of one hundred sixty (160) square feet and be a minimum of nine (9) feet in width.

Section 17.601 Purpose, Objectives and Jurisdiction.
(1) Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this ordinance is to regulate noncommercial, commercial and event signage with a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. The Common Council, by enacting this ordinance, recognizes the City has a significant and substantial governmental interest in promoting public safety and aesthetic values through the regulation of signs displayed within the City of Oconomowoc. Sign regulations, including but not limited to those which control the type, design, size, location and safe construction, are hereby established to further the goals of safety and aesthetics and achieve more specifically, the following objectives:
(a) To enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without difficulty or confusion;
(b) To protect property values, public investment and overall neighborhood character by promoting an attractive, harmonious and aesthetically-pleasing environment and preventing conditions which have undesirable impacts on surrounding properties;
(c) To promote the development of attractive and harmonious residential districts, viable commercial districts and to identify industrial and other uses;
(d) To protect the public and promote safety, including but not limited to traffic and pedestrian safety; and to minimize effects of signs which may distract or obstruct visibility of official traffic signals and other safety or informational devices; and

Section 17.804 Planned Development District Procedures
(1) Purpose
(a) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of Planned Developments, and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards.
(b) Planned Developments are intended to allow exemptions and modifications for redevelopment areas within the community, and for mixed use developments. Furthermore, planned developments are intended to forward both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the City by controlling the site design and appearance, the mix of uses, and the density and intensity of development. The planned development shall require a demonstrably higher level of site design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required.
(c) If allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this Chapter, planned developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan, landscape plan and architectural plan, and on a case-by-case basis. In order to prevent said undesirable impacts, all Planned Developments are required to follow certain procedural requirements applicable only to Planned Developments, in addition to the general requirements of this chapter and the underlying zoning district.
(d) The Planned Development District may also be used to accommodate the development or redevelopment of parcels consistent with the design principals of traditional neighborhoods and conservation subdivisions. Traditional neighborhood design means the compact, mixed-use neighborhood where residential, commercial, and civic buildings are within close proximity to each other. A conservation subdivision means a housing development in a setting that is characterized by compact lots and common open spaces and where natural features of land are maintained to the general extent possible. Such proposed developments may be considered for approval at locations determined by the City which would include appropriate conditions. The model Ordinance for traditional neighborhood development published by the University of Wisconsin Extension shall serve as a nonexclusive guide to assist in defining various aspects of this form of urban design along with such other sources of guidance that the Plan Commission and Common Council may choose to consult.
(2) Development Standards for Planned Developments:

Applicant's request. The Common Council may approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may approve the proposed conditional use with modifications (per the recommendations of the Plan Commission, Zoning Administrator, the applicant, other City staff, authorized outside experts, general public, or its own members) or may deny approval of the proposed conditional use. Any action to amend the provisions of the proposed conditional use requires a majority vote of the Common Council. The decision of the Common Council shall be made upon substantial evidence based upon the standards of this Code, per Wisconsin Statutes Section 62.23(7)(de). The Common Council's approval of the proposed conditional use shall be considered the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed conditional use.
(9) Effect of Denial: No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
(10) Review for Compliance: The City may conduct an investigation to ensure that the permittee is maintaining the use as applied for, in compliance with all conditions, and has not converted or modified the use. Failure to operate in accordance with the conditions of the conditional use permit shall be the subject of an enforcement action and civil penalties and/or grounds for setting the matter for public hearing to consider revocation of the permit. The election of civil penalties shall in no way act as a waiver of the revocation of the permit. The City may also pursue any other option permitted by law to require compliance with the conditions of the permit.
(11) Revocation of Conditional Use Permits:
(a) The Plan Commission, upon the direction of the City Council, shall hold a public hearing to consider the revocation of a conditional use permit granted in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
(b) Written notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of such public hearing shall be served on the owner of the property for which the permit was granted by registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing. Additional notice shall be given in the manner prescribed in this Chapter governing notices of conditional use permits.
(c) A conditional use permit may be revoked if, from the facts presented at the public hearing or by investigation, the Plan Commission finds any one (1) or more of the following grounds:
1. That the permit approval was obtained by fraud;
2. That the permit granted is being or has been exercised contrary to the conditions of such permit or in violation of any applicable licenses, permits, regulations, laws, or ordinances; and

Updated 7/15/20
3. That the use for which the permit approval was granted is being or has been exercised as to be detrimental to the public health or safety or so as to constitute a nuisance.
(f) The Plan Commission shall provide a recommendation to the Common Council after the affirmative votes of a majority of the membership of the Plan Commission, such membership being based upon membership present and voting. The Plan Commission shall forward its findings to the Common Council
(g) The Common Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Plan Commission, shall consider the revocation of a conditional use permit. The Common Council may affirm or modify the recommendation of the Plan Commission. Each decision by the Common Council to revoke a conditional use permit shall be by the affirmative votes of a majority of the Common Council. The Common Council shall mail a notice of its decision to the owner of the property involved. The Common Council may, after a public hearing has been held in the manner prescribed in this Section, affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the Plan Commission.
(12) Time Limits on the Development of Conditional Use: The start of construction of all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval by City Council and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. Prior to such a revocation, the Applicant may request an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by Plan Commission and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by Plan Commission).
(13) Discontinuing an Approved Conditional Use: All conditional uses which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this period.
(14) Change of Ownership: All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property. Modification, alteration, or expansion of any conditional use in violation as approved without approval by Plan Commission, shall be grounds for revocation of said conditional use approval.

Section 17.808 Variances
(1) Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which enable the City to hear and decide requests for variations from the terms of this Chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this Chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
(2) Definitions of Variance Type:
(a) Area Variance  In this subdivision, an area variance means a modification to a dimensional, physical, or locational requirement such as a setback, frontage, height, bulk, or density restriction for a structure that is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals under this paragraph.

CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 121
Updated 7/15/20
property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with the zoning ordinance unnecessarily burdensome.
(b) Use Variance  A property owner bears the burden of proving unnecessary hardship, as that term is used in this subdivision, for a use variance by demonstrating that strict compliance with the zoning ordinance would leave the property owner with no reasonable use of the property in the absence of a variance.
(c) In all circumstances, a property owner bears the burden of proving that the unnecessary hardship is based on conditions unique to the property, rather than considerations personal to the property owner, and that the unnecessary hardship was not created by the property owner.

2. Would granting the proposed variance be a substantial detriment to the
CITY OF OCONOMOWOC ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 122
Updated 7/15/20
public interest?
3. Would granting of the proposed variance result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public property, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare?
4. Have factors which present the reason for the proposed variance been created by the act of the applicant or previous property owner or their agent?
5. Would compliance with the Ordinance unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would conformity with the Ordinance create an unnecessary burden on the property owner?
(b) The Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the Zoning Board of Appeals for the Board's review and action. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
(7) Review and Determination by Zoning Board of Appeals

(b) The Zoning Board of Appeals must determine the standard that applies for the grant of the variance.
(c) The Zoning Board of Appeals must require the property owner bear the burden of proof.
(d) Any variance granted must be due to conditions unique to the property rather than considerations personal to the property owner.
(e) The variance cannot be granted if the hardship was created by the property owner.

Notice of the requested variance and the public hearing shall conform to the requirements of Wisconsin Statutes.

Granting of a variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed variance. Except as follows, any work authorized by a variance granted under this subdivision must be commenced by the issuance of a building permit within one year of the date of the variance being granted, and such work must be completed prior to the expiration of such building permit, or the variance automatically expires and is null and void.
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals may allow a larger time to commence and/or complete work, by specifying such extended time in writing at the time that the variance is granted.
