PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Mukwonago, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, revised through April 4, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village board through January 3, 1995. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David G. Poucher, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Shawn Reilly, Village Attorney, and Mr. Bernard W. Kahl, Village Clerk/Treasurer, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

(e)  Fees for location and copying. A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows: 
(1)  The cost of photocopying shall be calculated and paid as required and specified in the most current village board resolution. Such cost has been calculated not to exceed the actual, necessary and direct cost of reproduction.

Sec. 2-198. - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under W.S.A., § 19.37. Except as provided in this section, no request may be refused because the person making it is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under section 2-197(f)(6). A request may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request, in whole or in part, and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the village attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2-199. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the denial of such oral request. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under W.S.A., § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Code 1966, § 19.09)

(1)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law; 
(2)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or its exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state;

(4)  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret.

(c)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the village attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
(2)  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing. 
(3)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any village officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a village officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
(4)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
(5)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of village property, investing of village funds, or other village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
(6)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data. 
(7)  Communications between legal counsel for the village and any officer, agent or employee of the village, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under W.S.A., § 905.03. 
(d)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the village attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the village attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgement of the custodian and the village attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

c.  The applicant shall show that the proposed establishment will have a greater economic impact upon the community than simply the addition of another tavern, liquor store, convenience store or restaurant; and 
d.  The applicant shall show that the proposed establishment will benefit the community by substantially improving the tax base (i.e. the establishment will extensively rehabilitate a blighted or deteriorated building, will construct a new building on vacant land, will benefit the community by conferring some other tangible and substantial improvement for the area).

Such notice shall direct the person causing, permitting, or maintaining such nuisance or the owner or occupant of the premises to abate or remove such nuisance within 24 hours and shall state that unless such nuisance is so abated, the village police department zoning inspector will cause the nuisance to be abated and will charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be. 
(2)  Abatement by village police zoning inspector. If the nuisance caused is not abated within the time provided, or if the owner, occupant or person causing the nuisance cannot be found, the police department zoning inspector shall issue a citation for the violation of this section and then shall cause the abatement or removal of such public nuisances. 
(c)  Abatement by court or village police zoning inspector. If the police department zoning inspector determines that a public nuisance exists on private premises, but that such nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, he/she shall file a written report, inclusive of all photographs, sent notices and related materials relative to the public nuisance investigative actions at the police department to be kept on file. The village police inspector shall then have two options: 
(1)  The police department zoning inspector shall then issue a citation and then shall cause the abatement or removal of such public nuisance. Upon abating the nuisance, the charge for the cost thereof shall be the responsibility of the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting, or maintaining, the nuisance, as the case may be. The cost shall be billed through the village clerk's office. This action shall be taken pursuant to section 34-29(b)(2). 
(2)  Forward a written report to the village president who shall cause an action to abate such nuisance be commenced in the name of the village in the county or county circuit court in accordance with the provisions of W.S.A., ch. 823.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Section IV of Ord. No. 816, adopted Jan. 6, 2009, amended and recreated Div. 4 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Div. 4 was comprised of §§ 34-101-34-114, pertained to stormwater runoff, and derived from Ord. No. 670, adopted Sept. 19, 2000. 

Sec. 34-100. - Authority for ordinance. 
    This section is adopted by the village board of the Village of Mukwonago under the authority granted by W.S.A., §§ 61.354, 92.07(15), 281.33 and Ch. 236. The requirements of this section do not pre-empt more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(a)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals, including those authorized under W.S.A., §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(b)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated under rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under NR151.004 Wis. Adm. Code. 
(Ord. No. 816, § IV, 1-6-09; Ord. No. 914, § I, 5-17-16; Ord. No. 928, § I, 4-18-17) 
Sec. 34-101. - Findings. 
    The Village of Mukwonago Board finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled soil erosion and stormwater runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants; 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads; 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers, drainageways and other storm drainage systems; 
(6)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and 
(7)  Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health-threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment. 
(Ord. No. 816, § IV, 1-6-09) 
Sec. 34-102. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish regulatory requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources of the Village of Mukwonago from construction site erosion and post-construction stormwater runoff. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; establish erosion control and stormwater standards for building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger property. 
(b)  Through a single stormwater permit process, this ordinance is intended to meet the current construction site erosion control and post-construction stormwater management regulatory requirements of Subchapter III of both NR 151 and NR 216, Wis. Adm. Code, on the effective date of this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance prevents the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources from adopting or enforcing more stringent stormwater management requirements in future revisions of the Wisconsin Administrative Code. 
(c)  Provisions have also been incorporated to coordinate the stormwater permit requirements of this ordinance with other village zoning and land division regulations. 
(d)  The village board recognizes that the preferred method of addressing post-construction stormwater runoff from land development activities is through the preparation and implementation of regional stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds or subwatersheds. Accordingly, provisions have been incorporated into this ordinance to allow for the implementation of a regional stormwater management plan in lieu of complying with certain on-site stormwater management requirements. Where such stormwater management plans have not been developed or approved by the village board, it is the intent of the village board that the generic stormwater management standards set forth in this ordinance be applied unless otherwise recommended by the village engineer. 
(Ord. No. 816, § IV, 1-6-09) 
Sec. 34-103. - General administration. 
    The Village of Mukwonago Engineer, village administrator, and zoning administrator are designated to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. The village engineer, village administrator, and village zoning administrator shall also make recommendations, where appropriate, to the Village of Mukwonago Board relative to matters related to erosion and sediment control and stormwater management.

    This ordinance applies to land disturbing activities within the boundaries of the Village of Mukwonago, Wisconsin and within its extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction under W.S.A., ch. 236. 
(Ord. No. 816, § IV, 1-6-09) 
Sec. 34-105. - Definitions. 
    Applicable review authorities means the village planning commission, the village board, the village zoning administrator, and the village engineer, depending on the type of project and its location. 
    Applicant means any person or entity holding fee title to the property or their representative. The applicant shall become the "permit holder" once a permit is issued.

(Ord. No. 816, § IV, 1-6-09; Ord. No. 914, § IV, 5-17-16; Ord. No. 928, § IV, 4-18-17) 
Sec. 34-109. - Erosion control plan requirements. 
(a)  General erosion control plan requirements and performance standards. An erosion control plan shall describe how the permit holder and other responsible party will minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, soil erosion and the transport of sediment from land disturbing activities to waters of the state or other property. To meet this requirement, the following performance standards shall apply: 
(1)  All erosion control plans and associated BMPs shall comply with the planning, design, implementation and maintenance requirements of this division and the technical standards prepared by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(2)  All erosion control plans shall by design, achieve to the maximum extent practicable, a runoff discharge of no more than five tons of sediment per acre per year from sheet and rill erosion during land disturbing activities as compared with no sediment or erosion controls, until the site is stabilized. 
(3)  Erosion and sediment control BMPs may be used alone or in combination to meet the above noted performance standard. The requirements of this section are designed to meet the standard. 
(b)  Guiding principles for erosion control. To satisfy the requirements of this section, an erosion control plan shall, to the maximum extent practicable, adhere to the following guiding principles: 
(1)  Propose grading that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains; environmental corridors and any applicable regulatory setbacks from these areas; 
(2)  Minimize, through project phasing and construction sequencing, the time the disturbed soil surface is exposed to erosive forces. 
(3)  Minimize soil compaction, the loss of trees and other natural vegetation and the size of the disturbed area at any one time; 
(4)  Locate erosion control BMPs upstream from where runoff leaves the site or enters waters of the state and outside of wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental corridors or isolated natural areas. 
(5)  Emphasize the use of BMPs that prevent soil detachment and transport over those aimed to reduce soil deposition (sedimentation) or repair erosion damage. 
(c)  Specific erosion control plan requirements. The following applicable minimum requirements shall be addressed in erosion control plans to the maximum extent practicable. The village may establish more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements than the minimums set forth in this section if the village determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect an environmentally sensitive area or other property, or to address a change made during plan implementation. 
(1)  Access drives and tracking. Provide access drive(s) for construction vehicles that minimize tracking of soil off site using BMPs such as stone tracking pads, tire washing or grates. Minimize runoff and sediment from adjacent areas from flowing down or eroding the access drive. Direct site drainage away from access drives. 
(2)  Diversion of upslope runoff. Divert excess runoff from upslope land, rooftops or other surfaces, if practicable, using BMPs such as earthen diversion berms, silt fence and downspout extenders. Prevent erosion of the flow path and the outlet. 
(3)  Inlet protection. Protect inlets to storm drains, culverts and other storm water conveyance systems from siltation until the site is stabilized. 
(4)  Soil stockpiles. Locate soil stockpiles away from channelized flow and no closer than 25 feet from roads, ditches, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands or environmental corridors, unless otherwise approved by the village. Control sediment from soil stockpiles. Any soil stockpile that remains for more than 30 days shall be stabilized. 
(5)  Cut and fill slopes. Minimize the length and steepness of proposed cut and fill slopes and stabilize them as soon as practicable. 
(6)  Channel flow. Trap sediment in channelized flow before discharge from the site using BMPS such as sediment traps and sediment basins. Stabilize open channels in accordance with village standards and as soon as practicable. 
(7)  Outlet protection. Protect outlets from erosion during site dewatering and storm water conveyance, including velocity dissipation at pipe outfalls or open channels entering or leaving a storm water management facility. 
(8)  Overland flow. Trap sediment in overland flow before discharge from the site using BMPs such as silt fence and vegetative filter strips. 
(9)  Site dewatering. Treat pumped water to remove sediment prior to discharge from the site, using BMPs such as sediment basins and portable sediment tanks. 
(10)  Dust control. Prevent excessive dust from leaving the construction site though construction phasing and timely stabilization or the use of BMPs such as site watering and mulch - especially with very dry or fine soils. 
(11)  Topsoil application. Save existing topsoil and reapply a minimum of four inches to all disturbed areas for final stabilization, unless otherwise approved by the village, such as for temporary seeding or storm water infiltration BMPs. If adequate topsoil does not exist on the site to meet this requirement, it shall be imported or a topsoil substitute such as compost may be used, upon approval by the village. 
(12)  Waste material. Recycle or properly dispose all waste and unused building materials in a timely manner. Control runoff from waste materials until they are removed or reused. 
(13)  Sediment cleanup. By the end of each workday, clean up all off-site sediment deposits or tracked soil that originated from the permitted site. Flushing shall not be allowed unless runoff is treated before discharge from the site. 
(14)  Final site stabilization. All previous cropland areas where land disturbing activities will not be occurring under the proposed grading plans, shall be stabilized within 30 days of permit issuance. Stabilize all other disturbed areas within seven days of final grading and topsoil application. Large sites shall be treated in stages as final grading is completed in each stage. Any soil erosion that occurs after final grading or the application of stabilization measures must be repaired and the stabilization work redone. 
(15)  Temporary site stabilization. Any disturbed site that remains inactive for greater than seven days shall be stabilized with temporary stabilization measures such as soil treatment, temporary seeding or mulching. For purposes of this subsection, "inactive" means that no site grading, landscaping or utility work is occurring on the site or that portion of the site and that precipitation events are not limiting these activities. Frozen soils do not exclude the site from this requirement. 
(16)  Removal of practices. Remove all temporary BMPs such as silt fences, ditch checks and sediment traps as soon as all disturbed areas have been stabilized. Do not remove BMPs until disturbed areas have been stabilized. 
(17)  Site drainage. Site drainage plans shall comply with the provisions of section 34-110(d)(6) below. 
(18)  Stormwater BMP data. When a stormwater permit involves a maintenance of an existing stormwater BMP, including the removal of accumulated sediment, the village may require additional support data such as before/after surveys, design and construction details and oversight by a professional engineer licensed in Wisconsin. 
(d)  Preliminary erosion control plan contents. Preliminary erosion and sediment control plans shall contain the following items: 
(1)  A site map in accordance with section 34-110(c) below;

All storm water management plans and associated BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements to the maximum extent practicable. It is highly recommended that the applicant meet with the village engineer prior to preparing a storm water management plan to determine the applicability of these requirements early in the site planning process. 
(1)  Peak discharge. 
a.  Minimum requirement. To minimize downstream bank erosion and the failure of downstream conveyance systems, the calculated post-development peak storm water discharge rates shall be reduced as depicted in the table below. Modeling requirements for this provision are further described in section 34-111 below. 
Post Development Peak Discharge = Pre-Development Peak Discharge Recurrence interval storm 100 10 10 2 2 2 1 1  
b.  Release rate per acre. The village engineer may establish a maximum allowable release rate on a per acre basis that would supersede the requirements of subsection a. above for certain watersheds after the necessary hydrologic modeling is completed. 
c.  Peak discharge exemptions . Certain sites or portions of sites may be exempted from the peak discharge requirements of this subsection in accordance with subsection (e) below. 
(2)  Total suspended solids. 
a.  By design, each storm water management plan shall meet the following post-development total suspended solids reduction targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as compared to no runoff management controls: 
1.  For new land development and in-fill development, 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids load; 
2.  For redevelopment, 40 percent reduction of total suspended solids load from parking areas and roads; 
(3)  Infiltration. 
a.  BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the performance standards in Table 1, except as provided in subsection d. through h. below. 
TABLE 1 
Percent Connected Impervious Surface Description/Example Land Uses Post-Development Infiltration Volume a Maximum Effective Infiltration Area Up to 40% Description: Low imperviousness 
Example land uses: low density residential, parks, cemeteries. 90% of 
pre-development b 1% of site >40% up to 80% Description: Medium imperviousness 
Example land uses: medium and high density residential, multi-family residential, industrial, institutional, office park 75% of 
pre-development 2% of site >80% Description: High imperviousness 
Example of land uses: commercial strip malls, shopping centers, commercial downtowns 60% of 
pre-developments 2% of site  
a. All percentages are based on average annual rainfall. 
b. To avoid downstream flooding and chronic wetness issues from storm water discharges, the post-development infiltration volume for low density residential developments shall not be less than 25% of the 2-year, 24-hour storm, in accordance with subsection (7) below. 
b.  Modeling. Refer to section 34-111(a) for details on calculating runoff volumes and pre-development conditions. 
c.  Pretreatment. Pretreatment shall be required before infiltrating parking lot and road runoff from commercial, industrial and institutional areas. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with subsection h. below. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separators, sedimentation or bioretention basins, filtration swales or filter strips. All designs shall comply with the technical standards in section 34-111(b). 
Note: To achieve the infiltration requirement for the parking lots or roads, "maximum extent practicable" should not be interpreted to require significant topography changes that create an excessive financial burden. To minimize potential groundwater impacts, it is desirable to infiltrate the cleanest runoff. To achieve this, a design may propose greater infiltration of runoff from low pollutant sources such as roofs, and less from higher pollutant source areas such as parking lots. 
d.  Infiltration prohibitions. Due to potential for groundwater contamination, runoff shall not be infiltrated and will not be credited toward meeting the requirements of this subsection for the following: 
1.  Runoff from outdoor material storage and loading docks for tier 1 and tier 2 industrial facilities, as identified in NR216(2), Wis. Admin. Code. Parking lot runoff from tier 1 industrial facilities is prohibited. Parking lot runoff from tier 2 facilities may be infiltrated but may require pretreatment. 
2.  Runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas, not including rooftops and canopies. 
3.  Infiltration of runoff within 1,000 feet upgradient or within 100 feet downgradient of karst features. 
4.  Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as specified in NR811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, or within 100 feet of a private well as specified in NR812.08(4), Wis. Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development, not including rooftop runoff. 
5.  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in NR720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur. 
e.  Separation distances. Infiltration BMPs shall be located so the characteristics of the soil and the separation distance between the bottom of the infiltration BMP and the elevation of the highest groundwater table or the top of bedrock are in accordance with Table 2. 
TABLE 2 
Source Area Groundwater or Bedrock Separation Distance Soil Characteristics Industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roads 5 feet or more Filtering layer Residential arterial roads 5 feet or more Filtering layer Roofs draining to subsurface infiltration practices 1 foot or more Native or engineered soil with particles finer than coarse sand. Roofs draining to surface infiltration practices. Not applicable Not applicable All other impervious source areas 3 feet or more Filtering layer  
f.  Infiltration exemptions. The infiltration requirements of this subsection may be exempted by the village where: 
1.  The soils at the proposed bottom of an infiltration system have a measured infiltration rate of less than 0.6 inches per hour using a scientifically credible field test method; and 
2.  The village determines that it would impracticable to modify existing soil conditions based on soil profile evaluations extending five feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration system. 
Note: USDA soil textures of sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay are generally considerable unsuitable for infiltration and would require replacement or modification. 
g.  Alternate runoff uses. Where storage and reuse of runoff are employed, such as, landscape watering, toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation or storage on green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate uses shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section. 
h.  Groundwater protection. 
1.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this subsection shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Chapter NR109, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Notwithstanding (1) above, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
3.  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter NR815, Wis. Admin. Code relating to injection wells. 
4.  All storm water BMPs shall comply with the provisions of any applicable wellhead protection plan for a community water supply under Chapter NR811, Wis. Admin. Code. 
(4)  Protective areas. 
a.  Definitions. "Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
1.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet. 
2.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified by Waukesha or Walworth County, 50 feet. If there is a discrepancy between the County maps and the applicable United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, the more stringent stream identification shall apply. 
3.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
4.  For wetlands not subject to 5., 50 feet. 
5.  For highly susceptible wetlands, as determined by the village, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral shrub swamps. 
6.  Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with Chapter NR103, Wis. Admin. Code. This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. 
7.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet, unless otherwise required by another applicable regulation. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass. 
8.  In subsection a.1., 4. and 5., determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Chapter NR103, Wis. Admin. Code. 
9.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
b.  Requirements. The following requirements shall be met for all land development activity located within a protective area: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area, except for structures as authorized and defined under shoreland and floodland zoning. The erosion control plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the storm water management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation and a technical exemption may be applied for under subsection (e) below. 
2.  Where land disturbing activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area, but shall not encroach into wetlands, floodplains or primary or secondary environmental corridors. 
c.  Protective area exemptions. The protective area requirements of this subsection may be exempted in accordance with subsection (e) below and do not apply to the following: 
1.  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts; 
2.  Structures constructed in accordance with W.S.A., § 61.351; and 
3.  Sites where runoff does not enter the surface water, including wetlands without first being treated by BMP to meet the total suspended solids requirements under subsection 2., above and peak discharge requirements under subsection 1. above, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability. 
(5)  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
(6)  Site drainage. Measures shall be implemented to ensure proper site drainage, prevent property damage and protect public health and safety, including the following minimum requirements: 
a.  Drainage easement. Perpetual drainage easements or other deed restrictions shall be recorded on the property to preserve major storm water flow paths and permanent storm water BMP locations. Covenants in these areas shall not allow buildings or other structures and shall prevent any grading, filling or other activities that interrupt or obstruct flows in any way. Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in accordance with section 34-112. 
b.  Site grading. Site grading shall ensure positive flows away from all buildings, roads, driveways and septic systems, be coordinated with the general storm water drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties. 
c.  Street drainage. All street drainage shall be designed to prevent concentrated flows from crossing the traffic lanes to the maximum extent practicable. Design flow depths at the road centerline for on-street drainage, shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24 hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. 
d.  Bridges and cross-culverts. All new or modified bridges and cross-culverts shall comply with applicable design standards and regulations, facilitate fish passage and prevent increased flooding or channel erosion upstream or downstream from the structure. All bridges and cross culverts on collector and arterial roadways shall be designed to convey the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. All bridges and cross culverts on local roadways shall be designed to convey the ten-year, 24-hour design storm, while providing an overland flow path that does not impact any structures for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. A floodplain analysis shall be required for all developments impacting a navigable waterway. This analysis must demonstrate no adverse offsite impacts, in accordance with state and federal regulations and may require larger structures than those specified above. Design flow depths at the road centerline for all crossings shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. All predevelopment runoff storage areas within the flow path upstream of bridges and cross-culverts shall be preserved and designated as drainage easements, unless compensatory storage is provided and accounted for in modeling. As-built documentation shall be submitted in accordance with section 34-108 for all new or modified structures that are located within a mapped floodplain or that the village engineer determines to be necessary to maintain floodplain modeling for the applicable watershed. 
e.  Subsurface drainage. To avoid property and other damage from groundwater, all buildings planned for human occupation on a regular basis shall meet all of the following: 
1.  Basement floor surfaces shall be built one foot above the highest groundwater table elevation, as documented in the submitted soil evaluations in accordance with village standards. On sloped sites, basements may be allowed partially below the highest groundwater table only on the upslope side if they meet village drainage system requirements for design discharge and engineering oversight and long term maintenance. For these sites, the one foot groundwater separation will be enforced at the further downslope part of the basement. 
2.  Avoid hydric soils as much as possible. 
3.  The village engineer shall be notified of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which the village engineer may require to be restored or connected to other drainage systems. 
4.  No discharge of groundwater from tile lines, sump pumps or other means shall be allowed onto another person's land or any public space without the written approval of the village and the property owner. 
f.  Open channels. All open channel drainage systems shall at a minimum be designed to carry the peak flows from a 100-year, 24-hour design storm using planned land use for the entire contributing watershed area. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3h:1v unless otherwise approved by the village engineer for unique site conditions. Water surface elevations for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm shall be calculated for all existing and proposed open channels. 
g.  Storm sewers. All storm sewers shall be designed to convey the ten-year, 24-hour design storm while providing an overland flow path that does not impact any structures for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. 
h.  Changes to stormwater discharges. The sites where the village determines the post-development stormwater discharge flow paths will be significantly different that pre-development conditions, or where proposed stormwater discharges may otherwise have a significant negative impact on adjacent property owners, the village may require the applicant to obtain written authorization from impacted property owners, record a drainage easement to allow for the flow to cross those impacted properties and/or a hold harmless agreement, holding the village harmless from claims by negatively impacted property owners. 
i.  Structure protection and safety. Flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm under planned land use conditions may exceed the design capacity of conveyance systems, but shall not come in contact with any buildings. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular basis, the following additional requirements shall apply: 
1.  The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface shall be a minimum of two feet above the maximum water elevation produced by the 100-year, 24 hour design storm, including flows through any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot, and also following the procedures for internally drained areas outlined by Waukesha County; and 
2.  The structure shall be setback at least 50 feet from any storm water BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot, including any internally drained area with a significant contributing watershed and/or limited runoff storage capacity as determined by the village. Setback distance shall be measured from the closest edge of water at the elevation produced by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. The village may exempt existing structures and structures with no basement from this requirement if the village determines other site risks are minimal based on soil and site conditions. 
(7)  Additional requirements. The village may establish more stringent requirements than the minimums set forth in this section, such as addressing thermal impacts of storm water, downstream flooding, total maximum daily load (TMDL) standard for a watershed, other applicable state or federal laws, an order of any court of competent jurisdiction or chronic wetness conditions, if the village determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect a cold water stream, outstanding water resource or exceptional water resource, environmentally sensitive areas, downstream property or public health or safety. 
(e)  Technical exemptions. 
(1)  Exemption criteria. Following the provisions of this subsection, the village engineer may recommend to the village board to exempt a site or a portion of a site from meeting certain technical requirements of this section if the village engineer determines that exception criteria under subsection (d) above or one or more of the following applies: 
a.  Off-site BMP(s). The requirement has been satisfied through the use of off-site BMP(s). Off-site BMPs could be installed beyond the boundaries of the property covered by the application as part of a regional storm water management plan or through other legal arrangements. However, to be eligible for this exemption, the off-site BMP(s) must treat runoff from the site covered by the application; 
b.  No significant offsite impacts. The proposed land disturbing or land development activity is less than one acre in size and the village has determined the activity will have no significant impact on another property or on an environmentally sensitive area due to internal drainage or other site conditions that limit the potential impacts of runoff from the proposed activity; or 
c.  Site conditions. It is impracticable to meet the requirement due to site conditions such as slopes, soils, proximity to existing structures or desirable trees, limited site dimensions, surrounding land uses, the potential for groundwater contamination, public health or safety problems, or other factors beyond the control of the applicant. No site shall be entitled to an exemption under this paragraph due solely to the size of the proposed land development activity in relation to the parcel size. However, the village engineer shall provide special consideration in granting exemptions under this paragraph for the following sites: 
1.  Redevelopment sites. 
2.  In-fill development areas less than one acre. 
3.  Highway projects where limited public right-of-way land is available for the installation of storm water BMPs. 
4.  Land developments with less than ten percent of the proposed disturbed area planned to be connected impervious surfaces and the total cumulative area of all impervious areas is less than one acre using the final build-out condition. 
(2)  Application for exemption. An exemption under subsection (1) above may only be granted by the village board upon the applicant submitting the following items to the village engineer, which shall constitute a completed application: 
a.  A written request describing the provisions of this subsection for which an exception is being requested and an explanation of why;

ARTICLE III. - URBAN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION I. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 34-127. - Introduction. 
    The village's urban forestry management plan is administered by the village board in conjunction with the urban forestry commission serving in an advisory capacity. It is the responsibility of the public works director, the UFC, the village forester and village staff to provide for a sustainable urban forest in the community. Village staff, sometimes in conjunction with contracted professional services, is charged with the maintenance and preservation of public trees in the village. 
THE URBAN FORESTRY MISSION STATEMENT 
    The urban forestry commission (hereby known as UFC) shall serve as an advisory commission to the village board in the administration of the village's urban forestry program. This plan shall be carried out by the village forester, staff and/or village designee. The UFC shall also advise policy by referral from the plan commission and the village board. 
    The UFC shall advise on a policy for the development of an urban forestry program. This policy will guide the care, pruning, and removal of trees along all village streets and public spaces. It shall also review an annual planting plan to be carried out by village labor and/or volunteers as overseen by said forester. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-128. - Tree planting policy. 
(a)  The village forester shall prepare an annual preliminary planting plan to be submitted to the UFC for review. This plan, indicating budgeting for the tree program, may be modified by budget deliberations. 
(1)  The planting plan shall state where large or small trees are appropriate. Small trees shall be used where overhead utilities exist, with their mature height compatible to clearance requirements, large trees shall be used elsewhere unless unusual or special circumstances dictate otherwise. All varieties of trees used shall be from the approved street tree list (Appendix A). 
(2)  New trees planted on private property by the landowners must be a minimum of five feet behind the village right-of-way. 
(3)  Trees shall be properly spaced as to the species of tree and in accordance to the clearance specifications in section 34-129(c). 
(4)  Holes should be three times the diameter of the root ball, or spread of roots in case of bare root trees or container trees. This should provide trees with enough worked earth for their root systems to be established. All banks of the hole shall be loosened by shovel and trees should be planted at their original soil level at the root collar. 
(5)  All newly planted trees shall be woodchip mulched and protected with at minimum 12 inch plastic boots the same day of planting or as soon as possible. These guards are to remain in place until the tree is at least three inches at the base. 
(6)  New trees shall be watered as part of the planting regimen the day they are planted and then regularly for the first two years after planting utilizing techniques such as hose, water spikes, watering bags, etc. The goal is to ensure that newly planted trees receive the equivalent of one inch of rainfall per week. 
(b)  Improved streets in new subdivisions. The developer shall plant, at the developer's expense, one tree of an approved species of at least two and one-half inches in diameter measured four feet from its base for each 50 feet of frontage on all streets proposed to be dedicated or already dedicated adjacent to the property. The trees shall be planted in the existing or planned curb lawn area unless the village board authorizes the trees to be planted in an alternative location. 
(c)  Reconstructed and widened streets. When trees are removed in preparation for reconstruction or widening of any established street, new trees will be planted provided that there is adequate space in the terrace to reasonably support tree growth. 
(d)  Existing improved streets. No tree shall be planted within five feet of the right-of-way on any village street reconstructed without sidewalk. 
(e)  Unimproved streets. No trees shall be planted in the right-of-way area where no curb or sidewalk exists unless approved by the village forester in conjunction with the UFC. 
(f)  Approval for street trees. Approved trees may be planted by the property owner in the terrace after returning a completed tree planting permit to the village forester. The permit is free and used to insure that the location is acceptable for the type of tree that a property owner would like to plant (two inch minimum diameter measured four feet above the ground). 
(g)  Existing terrace trees damaged. The cost of the replacement of dead or severely damaged trees will be borne by the individual who caused the destruction. If the tree dies for any other reason, the cost removal will be paid by the village. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-129. - Tree planting standards. 
(a)  Condition. All plant material shall be healthy nursery stock. 
(b)  Diameter of tree trunk. All trees planted along public streets must be of sufficient size to absorb the abuse and conditions common to street trees. Unless otherwise permitted by the village forester, the minimum size will be six feet high and two inches in diameter for residents and two and one-half inches in diameter for developers. The diameter size of the tree is established by measuring four feet above its base. 
(c)  Location. Generally, all street trees shall be planted midway between the sidewalk and curb, following all guidelines listed below. 
(1)  Twenty-five feet from an intersection of two streets measure on the property line. 
(2)  Twenty feet from a signal or power pole. 
(3)  Ten feet from a driveway approach. 
(4)  Fifteen feet from a fire hydrant. 
(5)  Ten feet from gas, water valves and sewer lateral. 
(d)  Parkway width. No trees will be planted where the grassy terrace between the sidewalk and curb is less than five feet wide. 
(e)  Planting depth. The planting depth is determined by root collar. All new plantings should be placed so that the root collar is even with the soil surface or one to two inches above the surface. 
(f)  Spacing. Depending on growth characteristics of species, trees will be planted 35 to 50 feet apart unless otherwise approved by the village forester and UFC. 
(g)  Transplanted trees. When planting bare root trees, care must be taken to prevent unnecessary injury to roots. All damaged roots should be pruned. 
(h)  Tree selection. 
(1)  Select the right tree for the right place: 
a.  Carefully review all aspects of the site. 
1.  Closely review the soils ability of moisture to drain through the soil. 
2.  How much physical space is available above ground and below ground? 
3.  Don't plant a tree that will grow to a height of more than 30 feet under power lines. 
4.  Consider environmental factors such as exposure to the sun and road salt. 
b.  Choose a tree species which matches, or is adaptable, to the growing conditions you have found during the site analysis. 
(2)  Select a healthy tree from a reputable nursery. 
a.  Avoid plants that have damaged twigs, branches, roots or trunk. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-130. - Tree planting procedures. 
(a)  To plant the trees properly: 
(1)  Prepare the site by digging a hole at least three times the diameter, and at least the depth of the root ball, or the full extent of the root system of bare root trees. Leave a pedestal in the center of the hole to rest the root system on. This should provide trees with enough worked earth for its root system to be established. All banks of the hole shall be loosened by shovel and trees should be planted at their original soil level at the root collar. 
(2)  Find the root collar and plant the tree even or one to two inches high. It is recommended to remove burlap and/or wire prior to planting. 
(3)  Use good quality soil as backfill. Discard any rocks and debris from the soil before backfilling. 
(4)  Water the soil with a garden hose. Do not pack the soil down manually; water will do this naturally. Fill in voids with more soil after watering. New trees shall be watered as part of the planting process the day they are planted and then regularly for the first two years after planting, utilizing techniques such as hose, water spikes, watering bags, etc. The goal is to ensure that newly planted trees receive the equivalent of 1 inch of rainfall per week. 
(5)  Create a two- to four-inch deep mulch bed using wood chips. The mulch should not touch the trunk directly to prevent mold and bacteria from forming. Apply heavier at edges to create a "saucer" effect. All newly planted trees shall be wood chip mulched and protected with at minimum 12 inch plastic boots. 
(6)  Staking: If you must stake, use a wide belt-like material when supporting the tree to avoid injuring the bark, trees need to move in the wind, so allow some "play" in the support system to allow the trunk to sway without being uprooted. 
(7)  Prune any broken, dead or dying limbs without damaging the branch collar at the time of planting. Routine pruning should be started one year after planting. Do not use pruning paint or wound dressing on the pruning cuts. 
(8)  Wait until one year after planting to fertilize. 
(b)  Additional Care. Pruning, mulching and fertilizing should be provided as needed. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-131. - Maintenance and care of newly planted trees. 
(a)  Fertilizing. Fertilization of planted trees in the first year is not recommended. Typically a tree can be fertilized once it has become established, usually two or three years after planting. Only healthy established trees are to be fertilized. Fertilizing an established tree when growth is slow and vigor is low, which is indicated by off-color leaves or needles and by abnormal loss of foliage, will place the stressed tree even deeper into stress. Stressed trees should be watered and otherwise left undisturbed until they recover. Fertilizer should be applied in the early spring before leaves appear. A general purpose fertilizer containing nitrogen and potash is recommended. 
(b)  Mulching. A layer of wood chip mulch around the base of the tree will help conserve the soil moisture and help protect the tree and reduce competition from grass for nutrients. The mulch should note piled around the trunk as the heat generated may damage the bark. The mulch should be approximately four inches thick at the perimeter, creating a "saucer" effect towards the trunk. Newly planted trees shall be wood chip mulched and protected with at minimum eight inch plastic boots. 
(c)  Tree pruning. No pruning should occur at the time of planting, Pruning at this time will reduce the amount of stored energy that the tree contains and could cause added stress to the tree. During the second year a pruning schedule can begin. 
(d)  Tree staking. When staking, use wide bands of nylon strap or inner-tubes to support the tree. Make sure that the tree has a small amount of room to move. 
(e)  Watering. Newly planted trees require one inch (ten gallons) of water per week during the growing season to maintain health. The property owner shall provide adequate moisture to trees. The village should use local media to promote watering during dry periods. New trees shall be watered as part of the planting process the day they are planted and then regularly for the first two years after planting, utilizing techniques such as hose, water spikes, watering bags, etc. The goal is to ensure that newly planted trees receive the equivalent of 1 inch of rainfall per week. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-132. - Street trees recommended. 
(a)  Acceptable street tree list (Appendix A). 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-133. - Tree maintenance above public right-of-way. 
    In the Village of Mukwonago a rotational pruning schedule will be put into operation. With this pruning system public trees are thoroughly pruned for low hanging branches, dead wood, and clearance of branches overhanging public buildings. 
(a)  Criteria for the selective removal of plant parts. 
(1)  Trimming and sanitation. Trees standing in and upon any public street or place, or upon any lot or land adjacent thereto, shall be pruned and trimmed so the lowest branches projecting over the public street or alley will provide a clearance of not less than 14 feet and a clearance of not less than ten feet over any other public place and so that no dead, broken or otherwise hazardous branches shall be likely to fall and do injury to the public. Any tree not trimmed as provided in this section shall be deemed hazardous. The minimum clearance may be may be adjusted in unusual circumstances on a tree by tree basis with authority of the village forester and/or a certified arborist under the direction of the village forester. Village staff or designee will trim the trees in the public right-of-way. Any tree on private property shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Upon notification from the village forester, the property owner shall have ten days to comply with this order. After ten days with no action taken on the matter, village staff or designee will perform the work and the property owner shall be billed for the services as a special charge for current services, pursuant to W.S.A., § 66.0627. 
(2)  Light clearance. Remove the minimum amount of branches to allow for an adequate street lighting pattern on pavement. 
(3)  Storm damage repair. Preserve as much of the trees possible, and train new growth for the future. 
(4)  Building clearance. Remove interfering branches to a maximum of six feet clearance of a problem area. 
(5)  Transplanted trees. Pruning of live tissue should be avoided at time of transplanting and should be left for the following year. The exception: removing dead or broken branches, this should be done when planting. 
(6)  Intersection visibility. Utility and traffic clearance guidelines, in addition, no new tree shall be planted within 25 feet of the inside intersection of the roads closest to the tree site. (Generally where the sidewalks meet at the property corner.) 
(b)  Pruning specifications. 
(1)  All cuts should be made sufficiently close to the branch collar so that wood growth can readily start under normal conditions. 
(2)  Safety considerations are followed at all times during the operation and may include blocking off of street with barricades. 
(3)  Topping of trees is prohibited. If trees must be reduced in size the drop crotch pruning method shall be used. 
(4)  Climbing spurs must not be used during pruning operations. 
(5)  All wires are to be considered as "hot" or "live": any branches that arc within ten feet of an energized line should not be pruned. Call the appropriate utility for assistance, if necessary. Any branches that accidentally fall against or hang on wires must be removed by the appropriate utility. 
(c)  Pruning operations. 
(1)  Section pruning. 
a.  The village is divided into sections. These trees will be pruned in rotation in accordance with previously mentioned criteria and specifications. 
b.  Vehicle and pedestrian traffic must be fully warned of potential danger in work areas. 
c.  Trees found to be in unsafe condition are to be reported immediately to the village forester. 
d.  Private citizens are to be treated with respect and courtesy at all times regardless of conditions or conflicts. 
e.  At the end of each working day, all debris shall be picked up before leaving work area. 
f.  No equipment shall be left at the work site overnight. 
g.  Report all unusual situations or conditions to the village forester. 
(d)  Spot pruning. 
(1)  Pruning for special purpose. Safety, light clearance, traffic clearance, building clearance, house moving, and construction. These are special assignments and should be handled as such. 
(e)  Storm calls-Priority trimming. 
(1)  Only authorized personnel will be used 911 storm calls. 
(2)  No work will be performed on the site where electrical wires are down, damaged, or broken. 
(3)  The appropriate utility company must be called if any wires are damaged or broken. 
(4)  If damage has occurred to private property, report it to the proper authorities before leaving the scene. 
(5)  All branches and debris should be neatly piled so that there is no interference with the sidewalk, driveway, or gutter. 
(6)  Contact with property owners shall be made before work assignment. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-134. - Street tree removal policy. 
(a)  Reason for removal. Trees located in the terrace (the area between sidewalk and curb or between street lanes), parks, and other public property are removed when they are dead, dying, dangerous, injurious to public improvements, or condemned because of Dutch Elm disease and other diseases. The cost of removal will then be assumed by the village including the cost of stump removal. 
(b)  The village forester will determine removal of undesirable tree species. The property owner has the right to appeal removal decisions to the village forester and UFC. 
(c)  Location. 
(1)  Check location and description of tree on work order before starting removal. 
(2)  Check surrounding area for wires and other possible problems. 
(d)  Clean up. 
(1)  Work site cleanup shall be the same as the pruning operations. 
(2)  Wood from the work site shall be transported to the village garage or removed by the contractor if the abutting property owner does not want the wood. 
(Ord. No. 885, § I(Att.), 10-21-14) 
Sec. 34-135. - Tree protection policy. 
    In construction areas the cost of tree protection is paid by the contractor. Remediation must be performed to the satisfaction of the village forester. If village crews perform the work they shall be responsible to the village forester. 
(a)  Depositing material near trees.

Trees which are to be protected should be clearly indicated on the drawings for the street reconstruction project. It should also be noted that it may not be possible to save all terrace trees when significant widening and/or regrading is required to meet the goals of the project. The species, size, location and health of an existing terrace tree will be the determining factors as to whether or not a tree should be protected. Where terrace trees cannot be protected, suitable replacement terrace trees should be included in the project scope. The village forester and director of public works should be involved in this process. 
(2)  The project specifications should include a summary of the tree protection provisions that are expected and required during the construction phase of the project. A penalty for non-compliance by the contractor shall be considered.

a.  Describe the nuisance and recommended procedures for its abatement; 
b.  State that the owner shall abate the nuisance, at the owner's expense, within 14 days of the date of the notice unless, within ten days of the date of the notice, the property owner requests a hearing before the director of public works to show that such nuisance does not exist or does not endanger the health of other trees, life or property in the village; and 
c.  Establish a time and place for a hearing before the director of public works, not less than 14 days after service of such notice, on the abatement action to be taken. 
(3)  If the director of public works determines that a public nuisance exists following a hearing under this section, the property owner shall abate the nuisance as directed within ten days after such hearing. The forester may extend the time allowed the property owner for abatement work for not more than ten additional days. 
(4)  If abatement does not occur in the time allotted, the forester shall proceed to abate the nuisance by means of a court order with the assistance of the village attorney.

(2)  In order to facilitate the work and minimize the inconvenience to the public of any spraying operation conducted under this chapter, the forester shall give advance public notice of such operation by public media, public service announcements or other effective means and shall post appropriate warning notices in the areas and along the streets where trees are to be sprayed at least 24 hours in advance of spraying. When any residue or concentrate from municipal spraying operations is likely to be deposited on any public street, the forester shall also notify the chief of police, who shall take all necessary steps to make and enforce temporary parking and traffic regulations on such streets as conditions require. Temporary "no parking" notices shall be posted in each block of any affected street at least 24 hours in advance of spraying operations.

ARTICLE VI. - SEX OFFENDERS[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 913, § I, adopted June 21, 2016, repealed the former art. VI., §§ 54-132-54-140, and enacted a new art. VI as set out herein. The former art. VI pertained to residency restrictions for sexual offenders and derived from Ord. No. 881, § I, adopted Sept. 16, 2014. 

Sec. 54-132. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  The Wisconsin legislature has provided for the punishment, treatment and supervision of persons convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children, including their release into the community. Indeed, W.S.A., ch. 980, provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons. The purpose of this article is to protect the public, to reduce the likelihood that convicted sex offenders will engage in such conduct in the future. 
    The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is high, and when convicted sex offenders re-enter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. See Smith v. Doe, 538 US 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed. 2d 164 (2003) and McKune v. Lile, 536 US 24, 34, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), citing United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sex Offenses and Offenders, 27 (1997) U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (1997). 
    The village board has reviewed research on sex offenders, including the findings of a number of states across the United States, including, but not limited to, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Iowa and California as they pertain to laws adopted and which relate to imposing restrictions on sex offenders with respect to residency; and in addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit Decision on Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700, 716 (8th Cir. 2005) providing, in part, "the record does not support a conclusion that the Iowa General Assembly and the governor acted based merely on negative attitudes toward or fear of, or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group (citations omitted). Sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism and the parties presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense. Even experts in the field could not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend, whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among those who "cross over" to offend against a younger child, or the degree to which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk of re-offense against children. One expert in the district court opined that it is just "common sense" that limiting the frequency of contact between sex offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of an offense (citations omitted). The policymakers of Iowa are entitled to employ such "common sense" and we are not persuaded that the means selected to pursue the state's legitimate interest are without rational basis". 
    The board finds the negative consequences of failing to regulate the movement of sex offenders is a hazard to children and the community. Thus, the village has a duty and need to regulate where sex offenders reside and loiter within the village once they are reintegrated into the community. This chapter [article] is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of the children in the village from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. It is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the village's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing residence; and by regulating certain activities that may be used by sexual offenders to prey on children. 
(b)  The village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools, day-care centers and other places children frequent. The village finds and declares that in addition to schools and day-care centers, children congregate or play at public parks. 
    The board notes that W.S.A., § 61.34 authorizes the village board to enact legislation for the health, safety and welfare of the public. In addition, W.S.A., § 61.34(5) notes that the powers, rights and privileges accorded villages under said chapter are to be liberally construed in order to promote the general welfare, peace, good order and prosperity of the village. 
(c)  This article will not apply to sexually violent persons, as defined in W.S.A., § 980.01(7), because these persons are controlled under the regulations of W.S.A., ch. 980.

Visitors shall comply with any directions given to achieve this end. 
(2)  Nonexclusive use. No person shall use any portion of the picnic areas or of any of the buildings or structures therein for the purpose of holding picnics to the exclusion of other persons, nor shall any person use such area and facilities for an unreasonable time if the facilities are crowded, except that exclusive use of the building may be permitted upon prior approval of the village board. 
(3)  Fires and cleanup. No person shall leave a picnic area before the fire is completely extinguished and before all trash in the nature of boxes, papers, cans, bottles, garbage and other refuse is placed in the disposal receptacles, where provided.

Nothing in this section, however, is intended to permit the erection or maintenance of a sign which compromises the public safety, health and welfare or which is in conflict with the village's comprehensive plan or relevant portions thereof, or is in conflict with the master sign plan on record for a multi-tenant property in accordance with section 64-22(d)(21) or section 64-23(d)(20). Nothing in this section shall prevent an owner from requesting that the master sign plan on record be amended. 
(b)  Eligibility determination and limits . The plan commission shall review requests for special exceptions and shall only grant a special exception when the applicant demonstrates that unusual site factors preclude the construction of a sign in accordance with this chapter 64. If granted, the plan commission may place limitations, restrictions and conditions upon the approval. Special exceptions may be granted only to the following specified limits: 
(1)  The allowance of sign height and or sign size to exceed maximum standards that accommodates visibility needs with a limitation of any special exception shall not exceed 20 percent of maximum sign height or 20 percent of maximum area allowed for all signs. 
(2)  The allowance of one freestanding structure sign on any property abutting the Interstate 43 right-of-way equal to or over 2.01 acres in size when the amount and location of wall signs and freestanding signs allowed on the property are not able to be visible from the lanes of traffic on I-43 because of special factors of sign location, building location, topography, and similar factors. Please see section 64-19(g)(5) for additional standards. The plan commission may set limits on the height and size of the structure sign pursuant to the extent of site conditions that allows sign visibility. 
(3)  The allowance of additional freestanding monument signs on large properties over ten acres in size with multiple right-of-way access points and an excessive right-of-way to property size ratio not typical in the village. 
(4)  The allowance of multiple wall signs for a tenant within a multi-tenant building on a property over 3.0 acres within the village center, or over 2.0 acres within the village proper area, when the size and conditions of the tenant having a large building frontage or multiple entrances is similar to that of a single tenant building that is allowed multiple wall signs. 
(5)  The allowance of a reduction of up to 50 percent of the required freestanding sign setback from a property line measured to the furthest projection of the sign, but not within three feet of any lane of traffic. In the case of a sign setback from a state highway, the special exception shall be approved only after receipt of written approval from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. 
(6)  The allowance of a property owner to request to be placed in the next largest sign size category per acres of property, when the size of the property is within ten percent of the next largest sign size category, and the property is within an area or adjacent to properties within the next largest sign category. 
(7)  The allowance of a sign to project over a public right-of-way when the sign is attached to an existing building that is abutting or near a public right-of-way, but not over a lane of traffic. If the sign projects over a state or county highway, written approval for the projection from the proper state or county authority is needed prior to special exception approval. If approved, the property owner and the sign owner, if different from property owner, shall sign a license agreement that indemnifies the village, and the county or state if necessary, of any and all liability and maintenance responsibility resulting from the location of the sign. The license agreement shall be approved by the village board prior to any permit issuance. 
(8)  The allowance of a reader board to be included with a wall sign system, projecting sign or roof sign if the property does not have the opportunity to locate a freestanding sign. The plan commission may limit the size and type of reader board. 
(c)  Procedure. The following shall be the procedure for a special exception application: 
(1)  Any applicant who desires a Special Exception from any provision as listed in section 64-34(b) shall request a public hearing before the plan commission. The applicant shall submit a written request for a hearing to the village clerk with the appropriate fee as posted in the office of the village clerk and all necessary information as requested by the village clerk. The request shall be scheduled for hearing with Class 2 notice within timeframes for scheduling a hearing as established by the village clerk and Wisconsin Statutes for a Class 2 notice. 
(2)  If the plan commission finds the special exception should be granted, the plan commission shall specifically list in writing the finding of facts to justify the granting of the special exception. The decision shall be forwarded to the zoning administrator and building inspector with directions to issue a permit in accordance with the decision; subject to the application for sign permit conforming to all other applicable regulations and standards of this chapter 64 for issuance of a permit. 
(3)  If the plan commission finds that a special exception shall not be approved, the plan commission shall specifically list in writing the finding of facts for denial of the special exception, with the village clerk forwarding the decision with the finding of facts to the applicant within ten village business days of the decision. 
(4)  The decision of the plan commission shall be final.

Upon completion of the work or improvement for which a special assessment is levied and upon certification by the village manager or designee that such work or improvement has been completed, the village clerk-treasurer shall bill the property owner by invoice for the full amount of the assessment. Such invoice shall notify the owner that he or she may elect within 30 days of the date of the invoice to pay such amount in full without interest or to pay by installments with interest as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Cash payment. Payment of the assessment shall be made to the village clerk-treasurer on or before the expiration of 30 days from the date of the assessment notice, without interest. If the amount is not paid within 30 days, and the taxpayer does not notify the village, the full amount of the assessment shall be placed on the tax roll in ten equal installments, one-tenth each year, plus interest on the unpaid balance. 
(c)  Installment payment. If the property owner should so elect, payment of the full assessment may be made in installments according to the installment plan set out in the special assessment report adopted by the village board. On the installment plan, the full principal amount of the assessment shall be paid in equal annual installments, plus the interest on the unpaid balance. The first installment shall be due and payable at the same date that real estate taxes are due and payable for the current year. The first installment shall include the interest commencing with the date shown on the assessment notice.

(2)  Reimbursement. As additional customers outside of the property for which the total cost of extension has been collected are connected to a water main, sanitary sewer main or storm sewer main originally paid for by the applicant's contributions, the village will require, as a condition of service that each additional customer pay to the village an amount equal to the special assessment he or she would have paid at the time of the installation. Such amounts will be retained by the village and distributed periodically, when sufficient in amount to warrant distribution, to the then current owners of the property which was subject to the original customer contribution on a pro rata basis. As an alternative to the distribution method specified in the preceding sentence, the owner of the property subject to the original customer contribution may, by agreement with the village at the time of the original customer contribution, designate the persons to whom the distribution will be made, subject to the terms specified by the village in the agreement. No reimbursement under this subsection shall be collected or paid to contributing customers after ten years from the installation of the extension provided for in subsection (f)(1) of this section, nor shall any reimbursement be made in excess of the amount contributed. 
(3)  Alternative. As a complete alternative to the procedure set forth above, the village may proceed under W.S.A., § 66.0821(2)(a)(2). 
(g)  Deferring certain assessments; deferred special assessments. Pursuant to W.S.A., § 66.0715(2), the due date of any special assessment levied against property abutting on or benefited by a public improvement may be deferred on such terms and in such manner as prescribed by the village board while no use of the improvement is made in connection with the property. The special assessments shall become due and payable in full within 30 days of completion of any improvements upon the property which cause the property to make use of the improvement for which the special assessment was levied, or upon the sale and transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. The special assessment shall be subject to interest as prescribed by the village board and the interest shall accrue from the date of the assessment notice. The special assessment and interest shall be a lien against the property. 
(h)  Permits. Prior to the issuance of any building or plumbing permit, the village zoning administrator or designee shall refer the application for a permit to the village clerk-treasurer to determine if a special assessment, customer contribution or a deferred assessment is outstanding against the parcel involved.

In the event the statement rendered to the property owner or the time given for the property owner to pay is too late in the current year for the charge, when it becomes delinquent, to be extended on that year's tax roll, then the delinquent charge shall be extended to the following year's tax roll. 
(c)  Escrow or reserve accounts for certain projects. When large or complex projects, subdivisions and/or projects requiring a development agreement are submitted to the village for its review and approval the developer and/or property owner shall establish an escrow or reserve account, the "account," with the village clerk. The account will be debited for payment of professional services required by the village during the review and construction of such projects. The village clerk shall distribute monthly statements to the developer or property owner who established the account. The amounts in the account shall be determined by the village administrator, in consultation with the village planner and/or engineer, for no less than $2,000.00 or more than $5,000.00 during the concept and design review and approval phase. During the construction phase the account shall be no less than $5,000.00 and no more than $10,000.00. The account shall be replenished to the specified and required level within 20 days when the balance is reduced to $1,000.00 or less. If the account is not replenished in a timely manner, the village clerk shall notify village professionals of said nonpayment and they shall cease providing any professional services on that account unless and until advised otherwise by the village clerk. Funds remaining in the account will be returned to the developer and/or property owner in a timely manner after the project is complete.

(2)  Application. All application shall be in writing upon forms which the director of public works or designated representative shall provide and shall include the name of the owner and the description of the property on which the work is to be done, along with such pertinent information as the director of public works or designated representative may require and shall state that the property owner and the applicant will be bound by and subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Issuance, term, suspension and revocation. When the director of public works or designated representative is satisfied that the work proposed by the applicant can be done in conformity with this chapter and after the appropriate fees have been paid to the village, the director of public works or designated representative shall issue the permit. Such permit shall be good for the continuous performance of the work named thereon. A permit shall automatically expire when work ceases for a period of 60 days without good and reasonable cause for same and shall automatically expire on completion of the work for which it was issued, provided the director of public works or designated representative may, upon notice, suspend or revoke such permit for violation of the provisions of this chapter. Applications for work within the right-of-way will be reviewed to confirm that placement of any proposed utilities meet the following standards: 
a.  Above ground utilities shall not be located within the driveway vision triangle. Vision triangle is defined as a triangle formed by connecting a point at 15 feet along the edge of the roadway pavement and 15 feet along the driveway pavement as measured from the intersection of the driveway pavement and the roadway pavement. No obstructions shall be permitted in this area above the height of three feet. 
b.  Above ground utilities and all associated supports and/or foundations shall be a minimum of four feet from the back of curb in urban cross sections and 12 feet from the edge of road pavement in rural cross sections unless the location is pre-approved by the director of public works. 
c.  Any private utility and all associated supports and/or foundations shall be a minimum of ten feet horizontal distance from a public utility, or if the public utility is located underground a minimum horizontal distance equal to the depth of the public utility below adjacent surface, whichever horizontal distance is greater. 
d.  The above ground utility shall not materially impede the flow of storm water within the ditch line or at outlet/inlet structures as determined in the reasonable discretion of the director of public works. 
e.  Applicant shall provide a hold harmless agreement to protect the Village against any damage that results from the collapse of the above ground utility and the granting of this permit. 
f.  If the height of the above ground utility is greater than the adjacent zoning district setbacks or the distance to the nearest permanent habitable structure, the applicant shall submit an Engineer's Certificate. The certificate shall show that the above ground utility is located/constructed such that the fall zone is less than the adjacent zoning district setbacks or the distance to the nearest permanent habitable structure. 
g.  All private utility infrastructure located within the right-of-way shall be removed upon abandonment of the equipment. 
(b)  Insurance and bond. 
(1)  Insurance. The person doing the work contemplated by this section shall save the village harmless from any claim or demand for damages and shall file a certificate of insurance with the director of public works giving evidence of liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000.00 bodily injury and property damage aggregate, naming the village and its employees as additional insured on a primary and noncontributory basis. Such insurance shall not be canceled or reduced without the insurer giving 30 days' prior written notice to the director of public works. Cancellation or reduction of insurance shall automatically suspend the permit, and no further work shall be done under such permit until a new certificate of insurance complying herewith is filed with the director of public works. 
(2)  Bond. Except for public utilities, a financial guaranty in the amount of $5,000.00 in the form of cash or a letter of credit shall be deposited or filed with the engineering services division prior to the issuance of the permit required in subsection (a)(3) above. The financial guaranty may be used to complete restoration to the satisfaction of the director of public works or designated representative. The financial guaranty shall not relieve the applicant of responsibility for all costs to restore the excavated area to the satisfaction of the director of public works or designated representative. 
a.  Permits with impervious surface disruption. After the three-year maintenance period ends, the village will conduct a final inspection. The applicant shall make all necessary repairs. After repairs are made and approved, the village will issue final acceptance and the surety shall be terminated and released. 
b.  Permits with pervious surface disruption only. After the one-year maintenance period ends, the village will conduct a final inspection. The applicant shall make all necessary repairs. After repairs are made and approved, the village will issue final acceptance and the surety shall be terminated and released. 
(c)  Fees. 
(1)  Minimum fee. A minimum fee as set by the fee schedule of the village shall be charged for each permit issued by the director of public works or designated representative for the issuance of an excavation permit in a village right-of-way. 
(2)  Inspection fee for utility work. In addition, a current schedule of inspection fees as set by the fee schedule of the village and as amended from time to time shall be kept on file in the village clerk's office and shall be paid by the applicant prior to issuance of the permit. 
(3)  Inspection. At the discretion of the director of public works or designated representative, a village inspector may be required to be present continuously during major portions of the excavation and/or repair. The applicant shall be responsible to pay for the actual cost of such inspections. Should this require the inspector to be on site beyond their normal working hours, the permit holder will be billed for the cost of the overtime. 
(d)  Regulation for filling cuts or excavations. 
(1)  General regulations. Excavated materials shall be hauled away and properly disposed of by the contractor. All excavations made in paved areas in the public right-of-way, not excluding gravel shoulders, shall be backfilled with a well-graded gravel material free of excessive fines and compacted in six-inch layers with mechanical compaction equipment. Alternatively, an approved slurry mix may be required. The excavation shall be filled with acceptable material up to the bottom of the surrounding pavement. The pavement shall be replaced in kind in such manner as to leave no offset with the surrounding pavement. 
(2)  All repairs to excavations in permanently improved streets shall be made by saw cuts around the perimeter of the excavation. No jagged edges or irregularities are allowed upon permanent repair. 
(3)  All excavations in areas of right-of-way which are not paved, excluding gravel shoulders, shall be backfilled with natural material compacted in 12-inch layers with mechanical compaction equipment. The natural material shall be placed to within four inches of the finished grade, and the area shall then be filled with four inches of the approved topsoil. The topsoil shall be raked to match the surrounding ground elevations, fertilized, seeded and covered with a suitable material to prevent erosion. Sod may be used in lieu of seeding; however, the sod must be placed flush with the surrounding growth. 
(4)  Excavations made in paved areas, including gravel shoulders, between October 15 and May 15 must be topped with temporary asphalt mix. The temporary patch must be replaced with permanent pavement as soon as practical or as directed by the village engineer or designated representative. 
(5)  When an excavation is expected to be open for longer than 96 hours, the village engineer or designated representative may require that the excavation be covered with a steel plate adequate to carry traffic. 
(6)  Defective pavement replacement. 
a.  If the pavement replacement settles or cracks within three years of the date of the permit and if failure of the replacement is due to improper backfill or compaction, the pavement and backfill in the excavation area shall be removed and replaced at the expense of the party taking out the excavation permit. Until the defective pavement is replaced or repaired to the satisfaction of the village engineer or designated representative, no further permits will be issued by the Village for that party. 
b.  Should it be determined by the director of public works or designated representative that the temporary pavement is not being properly maintained, the village will cause the work to be done and deduct the cost from the financial guaranty on deposit. 
(7)  Return of financial guaranty. After permanent repairs have been made, the party holding the excavation permit may request a refund of any remaining portion of the financial guaranty. An inspection will be made and, if the repair is found acceptable and there is no expectation of settling, the financial guaranty will be returned minus any charges that have occurred. In the event that the village has incurred costs related to the excavation exceeding the financial guaranty on deposit, the permit holder will be billed for the overage. Return of the financial guaranty does not relieve the permit holder of responsibility for the excavation repair for the three years stated in (6) of this subsection. 
(e)  Traffic control. 
(1)  It is the responsibility of the permit holder to provide and maintain all signage as required by the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(2)  The road shall not be closed without express written permission. 
(3)  It is the responsibility of the permit holder in cases of road obstruction to notify all appropriate agencies, including but not limited to: village departments of public works, utilities, fire and police; state and county jurisdiction representatives if needed, school bus companies; and the like. Said notification will take place at least 24 hours prior to commencing work. 
(f)  Emergencies. In the case of emergency, excavations may be made but all appropriate safety procedures must be used. A permit must be applied for as soon as practicable. 
(g)  Penalties. Failure to obtain a permit to commence work, except in the case of an emergency, will result in a fine of $500.00 per occurrence. Each day the excavation is not permanently restored, as determined by the director of public works or designated representative, shall constitute a separate occurrence. Penalties will not continue to accrue once a permit has been obtained and its conditions complied with.

(e)  Enforcement. 
(1)  The village may exchange audit and other information with the department of revenue and may do any of the following: 
a.  Whenever the village has probable cause to believe that the correct amount of room tax has not been assessed or that the tax return is not correct, inspect and audit the financial records of any person or entity subject to the room tax to determine whether or not the correct amount of room tax is assessed and whether or not any room tax return is correct.

c.  The grantee must extend and make cable television service available to any isolated resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard 175-foot drop line. 
(2)  Early extension. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The grantee shall then extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to the grantee. The amount paid by subscribers for early extensions shall be nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be treated as consideration for early extension. 
(3)  New development under grounding. In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give the grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development, and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the grantee's expense. The grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within five working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five-day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by the grantee. Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to the grantee by the village of a preliminary plat request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee prior to approval of the preliminary plat request. 
(c)  Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, or residents provided that five percent of those gross revenues are paid to the village as franchise fees under section 79-47. 
(1)  The grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the village than as required above, in which case the grantee's policy will be incorporated into the franchise agreement, and will be binding on the grantee. 
(2)  The violation of this section shall be considered a breach of the terms of this article for which the provisions of either section 79-57 or 79-66 shall apply, as determined by the village. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 20, 12-4-01)

(6)  RF leakage shall be checked at reception locations for emergency radio services to prove no interference signal combinations are possible. Stray radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation radio sites to prove no interference to airborne navigational reception in the normal flight patterns. FCC rules and regulations shall govern. 
(7)  The grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power for headend and transport system for a minimum of two hours. 
(8)  In all areas of the village where the cables, wires, and other like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires, or other like facilities underground. When public utilities relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the cable operator must concurrently do so. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 21, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-42. - Use of streets. 
(a)  Interference with persons and improvements. The grantee's system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets and public ways, or interfere with any improvements the village may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property. 
(b)  Restoration to prior condition. In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the village, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley disturbed, in as good condition as before the work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such work set by the village. 
(c)  Erection, removal and common uses of poles. 
(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the village with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the village determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(2)  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the village are available for use by the grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the village may require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and reasonable. 
(3)  In the absence of any governing federal or state statute, where the village or a public utility serving the village desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the village may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the village shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the village determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations. 
(d)  Relocation of the facilities. If at any time during the period of this franchise the village shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the village, shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense unless the utilities are compensated, in which case the grantee shall be similarly compensated. 
(e)  Cooperation with building movers. The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(f)  Tree trimming. The grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion (either above, at or below ground level) of any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the village. The village shall have the right to do the trimming requested by the grantee at the cost of the grantee. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the grantee, the grantee shall be responsible, shall defend and hold village harmless for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 22, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-43. - Operational standards. 
(a)  The grantee shall put, keep and maintain all parts of the system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period. 
(b)  Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within the franchise territory, the grantee shall, within 30 days, furnish the requested service to such person within terms of the line extension policy. A request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of this subsection if no trunk line installation capable of servicing that person's block has as yet been installed. 
(c)  The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum system use. 
(d)  The grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere with television reception of subscribers or persons not served by the grantee, nor shall the system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner the operation of the various utilities serving the residents within the confines of the village nor shall other utilities interfere with the grantee's system. 
(e)  The grantee shall have knowledgeable, qualified grantee representatives available to respond to customer telephone inquiries 24 hours per day and seven days per week. 
(f)  Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time, including wait time and the time required to transfer the call, shall not exceed 30 seconds. This standard shall be met no less than 90 percent of the time as measured on an annual basis. 
(g)  Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent of the total time that the office is open for business. 
(h)  Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. A standard installation is one that is within 175 feet of the existing system. 
(i)  Excluding those situations which are beyond its control, the grantee will respond to any service interruption promptly and in no event later than 24 hours from the time of initial notification. All other regular service requests will be responded to within 36 hours during the normal work week for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be: "morning;" or "afternoon;" not to exceed a four-hour "window" during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee will schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can be scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the customer. 
(j)  Customer service centers and bill payment locations will be open for walk-in customer transactions a minimum of eight hours a day Monday through Friday, unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the location or customers served. The grantee and village by mutual consent will establish supplemental hours on weekdays and weekends if it would fit the needs of the community. 
(k)  Subscriber credit for outages. Upon service interruption and/or outages of subscriber's cable service, the following shall apply: 
(1)  For service interruptions and/or outages of over four hours and up to seven days, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber's request, a credit of 1/30 of one month's fees for affected services for each 24-hour period service is interrupted for four or more hours for any single subscriber, with the exception of subscribers disconnected because of nonpayment or excessive signal leakage. 
(2)  For service interruptions and/or outages of seven days or more in one month, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber's request, a full month's credit for affected services for all affected subscribers. 
(l)  The grantee will provide written information in each of the following areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the request of the customer:

(2)  Prices and service options. 
(3)  Installation and service policies. 
(4)  How to use the telecommunications services. 
(m)  Bills will be clear, concise and understandable, with all cable services itemized. 
(n)  Credits will be issued promptly, but no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the resolution of the request and the return of the equipment by the grantee if service has been terminated. 
(o)  Customers will be notified a minimum of 30 days in advance of any rate or channel change, provided that the change is within the control of the grantee. 
(p)  The grantee shall maintain and operate its network in accordance with the rules and regulations as are incorporated herein or may be promulgated by the Federal Communication Commissions, the United States Congress, or the State of Wisconsin. 
(q)  The grantee shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this article. Should the village find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, grantee shall be required to implement a plan for resolution. Failure to make such improvements within three months of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties contained in section 79-66 are applicable. 
(r)  The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which will indicate the nature of each service complaint received in the last 24 months, the date and time it was received, the disposition of said complaint, and the time and date thereof. This log shall be made available for periodic inspection by the village. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 23, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-44. - Continuity of service mandatory. 
(a)  It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. 
(b)  If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the system, the grantee shall cooperate with the village, new franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services until it no longer operates the system. 
(c)  If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the village or without just cause, the village may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the village or a permanent operator is selected. If the village is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall reimburse the village for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the village that are the result of the grantee's failure to perform. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 24, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-45. - Complaint procedure. 
(a)  The village clerk is designated as having primary responsibility for the continuing administration of the franchise and implementation of complaint procedures. 
(b)  During the terms of this franchise, and any renewal thereof, the grantee shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local, toll-free telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipmental functions and similar matters. The grantee will use its good faith efforts to arrange for one or more payment locations in a central location where customers can pay bills or conduct other business activities. 
(c)  As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed. 
(d)  When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the village, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the village shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the following information: 
(1)  The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests; 
(2)  What system component was tested; 
(3)  The equipment used and procedures employed in testing; 
(4)  The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; 
(5)  Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required. 
    The village may require that tests be supervised, by an independent professional engineer or equivalent of the village's choice. The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the village such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove that the grantee failed to meet the technical standard, the grantee shall bear the cost of the test. If the test should prove that the grantee met the technical standards, the village shall bear the cost of the test. 
    The village's right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 25, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-46. - Grantee rules and regulations. 
    The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this franchise, and to assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 26, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-47. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  For the reason that the streets of the village to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the village are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the village at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the grantee to the streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the village an amount equal to five percent of the grantee's gross annual revenue from the operations of the grantee within the confines of the village or contract area. If the statutory five percent limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the franchise fee may be subject to renegotiation. 
(b)  This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the village by the grantee. 
(c)  The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable annually on a calendar year basis to the village and the grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts as previously defined within 45 days after the end of the year as established between the village and the grantee. 
(d)  The village shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within 24 months following the close of each of the grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the village as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the village which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
(e)  If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the legal maximum rate charged by the U.S. Internal Revenue service for late tax payments and the grantee shall reimburse the village for any additional expenses and costs incurred by the village by reason of the delinquent payment(s). 
(Ord. No. 682, § 27, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-48. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, this franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the village. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the village and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the Village of Mukwonago. The village shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within 120 days following receipt of written notice and the necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public unless the requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village shall not unreasonably withhold such consent to the proposed transfer. 
(b)  Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, the grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the village may inquire into the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the village in such inquiry. 
(c)  The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this franchise. 
(d)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village will not approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(e)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to this franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 28, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-49. - Availability of books and records. 
(a)  The grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times, and the village shall have the right to inspect, where reasonably necessary to the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the cable television system, at any time during normal business hours; provided where volume and convenience necessitate, the grantee may require inspection to take place on the grantee's premises. 
(b)  The following records and/or reports are to be made available to the village upon request, but no more frequently than on an annual basis unless mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the village: 
(1)  A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by the grantee to the village; 
(2)  Periodic preventive maintenance reports; 
(3)  Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies; 
(4)  Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or complaints periodically; 
(5)  Periodic construction update reports, including where appropriate the submission of as-built maps. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 29, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-50. - Other petitions and applications. 
    Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports either submitted by the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting cable television operations authorized pursuant to the franchise or received from such agencies shall be provided to the village upon request.

Sec. 79-52. - Removal of cable television system. 
    At the expiration of the terms for which this franchise is granted and any renewal denied, or upon its termination as provided herein, the grantee shall forthwith, upon notice by the village, remove at its own expense all designated portions of the cable television system from all streets and public property within the village. If the grantee fails to do so, the village may perform the work at the grantee's expense. Upon such notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this expense. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 32, 12-4-01)

(6)  An institutional network (I-Net) of cable, optical, electrical or electronic equipment, used for the purpose of transmitting two-way telecommunications signals interconnecting designated entities as set forth in the franchise agreement and mutually agreed to by the grantee and the grantor. Such institutional network may be provided as needed by utilizing capacity on the subscriber system. 
(d)  The grantee shall provide emergency broadcast capacity pursuant to FCC rules. 
(e)  [Interconnections.]

Such interconnection shall be made within a reasonable time limit to be established by the village. 
(2)  Interconnection procedure: Upon receiving the directive of the village to interconnect, the franchise shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
(3)  Relief: The franchise may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the village may rescind its order to interconnect upon petition by the franchisee to the village. The village shall grant the request if it finds that the franchisee has negotiated in good faith and has failed to obtain an approval from the operator or franchising authority of system to be interconnected, or the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates. 
(4)  Cooperation required: The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority or village, county, state and federal regulatory agency which may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the village.

(Ord. No. 682, § 33, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-54. - Rules and regulations. 
(a)  In addition to the inherent powers of the village to regulate and control this cable television franchise, and those powers expressly reserved by the village, or agreed to and provided for herein, the right and power is hereby reserved by the village to promulgate such additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers and furtherance of the terms and conditions of this franchise; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations.

The grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees. 
(c)  The village may make a written demand that the grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to this franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the village may place the issue of termination of the franchise before the village board. The village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting.

(d)  The village board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear any person interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether or not any violation by the grantee has occurred.

(f)  The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance.

(Ord. No. 682, § 44, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-65. - Theft of services and tampering. 
(a)  No person may intentionally do any of the following: 
(1)  Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a company by trick, artifice, deception, use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or other fraudulent means with the intent to deprive that company of any or all lawful compensation for rendering each type of service obtained. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from the presence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device not authorized by the cable television company, the major purpose of which is to permit reception of cable television services without payment. This inference is rebutted if the defendant demonstrates that he or she purchased that device for a legitimate use. 
(2)  Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain any cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the company providing that service. This paragraph does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technical assistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler or receiving device was for a legitimate use. 
(3)  Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of distributing cable television service to any other dwelling unit without authority from a cable television company. 
(4)  Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of obtaining cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the company providing the service. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that the cable service to the defendant's residence or business was connected under a service agreement with the defendant and has been disconnected by the cable television company and that thereafter there exists in fact a connection to the cable system at the defendant's residence or business. 
(5)  Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device installed with the authorization of a cable television company for the purpose of intercepting or receiving any program or other service carried by that company which that person is not authorized by that company to receive. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that, as a matter of standard procedure, the cable television company places written warning labels on its converters or decoders explaining the tampering with the device is a violation of law and the converter or decoder is found to have been tampered with, altered or modified so as to allow the reception or interception of programming carried by the cable television company without authority to do so. The trier of fact may also infer that a converter or decoder has been altered or modified from proof that the cable television company, as a matter of standard procedure, seals the converters or decoders with a label or mechanical device, that the seal was shown to the customer upon delivery of the decoder and that the seal has been removed or broken. The inferences under this paragraph are rebutted if the cable television company cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the customer. 
(6)  Possess without authority any device or printed circuit village board designed to receive from a cable television system any cable television programming or services offered for sale over that cable television system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any of the acts under subsections (1) to (5) with the intent that device or printed circuit be used to receive that cable television company's services without payment. Intent to violate this paragraph for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be inferred from proof of the existence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device if the totality of circumstances, including quantities or volumes, indicates possession for resale. 
(7)  Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish, advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit designed to receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a cable television system from a cable television system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, with the intent that the device, printed circuit, plan or kit be used for the reception of that company's services without payment. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that the defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board, plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit board in violation of this paragraph and during the course of the transaction for sale or lease the defendant expressly states or implies to the buyer that the product will enable the buyer to obtain cable television service without charge. 
(b)  Civil liability for theft of telecommunications service (including cable television service). 
(1)  Any person who incurs injury as a result of a violation of section 79-65 may bring a civil action against the person who committed the violation. Except as provided in subsection (b)(2), if the person who incurs the loss prevails, the court shall grant the prevailing party actual damages, costs and disbursement. 
(2)  If the person who incurs the loss prevails against a person who committed the violation willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage or prevails against a person who has committed more than one violation of section 79-65, the court shall grant the prevailing party all the following: 
a.  Except as provided in subsections (2)e. and f., not more than $10,000.00. 
b.  Actual damages. 
c.  Any profits of the violators that are attributable to the violation and that are not taken into account in determining the amount of actual damages under subsection (2)b. 
d.  Notwithstanding the limitations under [W.S.A., §] 799.25 or 814.04, costs, disbursement and reasonable attorney fees. 
e.  If the court finds that the violation was committed willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage, the court may increase the amount granted under subsection (2)a., not to exceed $50,000.00. 
f.  If the court finds that the violator had no reason to believe that the violator's action constituted a violation of this section, the courts may reduce the amount granted under subsection (2)a. 
(3)  If damages under subsection (2)c. are requested, the party who incurred the injury shall have the burden of proving the violator's gross revenue and the violator's deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the violation. 
(4)  In addition to other remedies available under this section, the courts may grant the injured party a temporary or permanent injunction. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 45, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-66. - Penalties. 
    For the violation of any of the following provisions of this franchise, penalties shall be chargeable to the letter of credit or performance bond as applicable as follows and the village may determine the amount of the fine for other violations which are not specified in a sum not to exceed $500.00 for each violation, with each day constituting as separate violation. 
(a)  Failure to furnish, maintain, or offer all cable services to any potential subscriber within the village upon order of the village: $200.00 per day, per violation, for each day that such failure occurs or continues.

(d)  Failure to comply with applicable construction, operation, or maintenance standards: $300.00 per day, per violation. 
(e)  Failure to comply with a rate decision or refund order: $500.00 per day, per violation, for each day such a violation occurs or continues. Grantor may impose any or all of the above enumerated measures against grantee, which shall be in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies it has under the franchise or under any applicable law. 
(f)  Any violations for noncompliance with the customer service standards of sections 79-43 through 79-45 the grantee shall pay $200.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues. 
(g)  Any other violations of this franchise agreement to be determined by the grantor in a public hearing but not specifically noted in this section shall not exceed $500.00 per day, per violation. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 46, 12-4-01) 
Sec. 79-67. - Procedures. 
(a)  Whenever the village believes that the grantee has violated one or more terms, conditions or provisions of this franchise, and wishes to impose penalties, a written notice shall be given to the grantee informing it of such alleged violation or liability. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation before the village may impose penalties unless the violation is of such a nature so as to require more than 30 days and the grantee proceeds diligently within the 30 days to correct the violation, or as promptly as possible thereafter to correct the violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within 60 days of notice from the village, or such other time as the grantee and the village may mutually agree to, the village may proceed to impose liquidated damages. 
(b)  The grantee may, within ten days of receipt of notice, notify the village that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the village shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the running of the 30-day cure period pending village board decision as required below. The village board shall hear the grantee's dispute. Grantee must be given at least five days notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. After the hearing, the village shall provide grantee a copy of its action, along with supporting documents. In the event the village upholds the finding of a violation, the grantee shall have 30 days subsequent, or such other time period as the grantee and the village mutually agree, to such determination to correct the alleged violation before penalties may be imposed. 
(c)  The rights reserved to the village under this section are in addition to all other rights of the village whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to penalties shall affect any other right the village may have. 
(d)  The village shall stay or waive the imposition of any penalty set forth above upon a finding that any failure or delay is a result of an acts of nature or due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the grantee.

Action on applications filed less than 35 days in advance shall be taken within seven days after the application is filed, but in no case later than ten hours in advance of the time applied for. The village clerk shall immediately, by the most reasonable means of communication, notify the applicant of such action, and, if the application is denied, the reasons for the denial of the permit shall be given. 
(b)  Modification of requested permit. In lieu of denying a permit, the village clerk may authorize the changing of assembly areas or dispersal areas or the conducting of the parade at a date or time, or over a route different than, as applied for as permitted. The applicant or permittee may accept such modification by immediately notifying the village clerk, in writing, of such acceptance.

If any person discharging sewage into the public sewer system procures any part, or all of his water from sources other than the village water utility, the person shall furnish, install and maintain at his expense, water meters, of a type approved by the water utility for the purpose of determining the volume of sewage discharged to the sewer system, as described in section 86-263. 
(Code 1966, § 23.06(1)) 
Sec. 86-237. - Residential equivalency charge. 
(a)  A residential equivalency charge is hereby imposed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises served by the wastewater works or otherwise discharging sewage, including nondomestic and industrial wastes, into the system. Such residential equivalency charge shall be payable as provided in this division and shall be on the basis of one unit for each residential equivalent unit. 
(b)  On or before September 1 of every year the village clerk shall recompute the assignment of residential equivalent units to all users within the system. Such summation of residential equivalent units will then be divided into the yearly debt service to arrive at the charge per residential unit. The recalculation shall be based upon the average water used by each customer, other than single-family dwellings, for the quarters ending March, June and December compared to the average amount of water used by all single-family dwellings for the quarters ending March, June and December. The assignment method shall apply only to buildings that are attached to and are customers of the village water utility. Other users shall be assigned REC's in accordance with section 86-263. The residential equivalency charge chart is attached as Appendix A of this article. 
(Code 1966, § 23.06(2)) 
Sec. 86-238. - Sewer use charge. 
(a)  A sewer use charge is hereby imposed upon all users of the wastewater works based upon the metered water used thereon or therein as calculated by the water utility. On or before September 1 of every year, the village clerk shall recompute the sewer use charge per 1,000 gallons of water used. This charge shall be computed by dividing the proposed net yearly operation and maintenance budget by the previous year's average water consumption. The residential water consumption for sprinkling during the quarter ending in September and any refrigeration, air conditioning system or industrial cooling water not entering the sewer system shall not be used in computing the sewer use charge. 
(b)  For residential users during the quarter ending September 30, the charge shall be the same as that assessed for the last quarter previous, ending June 30, unless the water consumption for this quarter is less than that for the quarter ending June 30, in which case the charge shall be for the actual water used.

(b)  Existing and future connections. For the purpose of this article, sewer connections in the village shall be classified as existing connections or future connections. Existing connections shall be those in existence and connections for which a sewer connection permit has been issued and construction started as of 11:59 p.m., March 31, 1980. Future connections shall be those not in existence as of 11:59 p.m., March 31, 1980. 
(c)  Schedule of charges. The sewer connection fee shall be $1,758.00 for each REC assessed against the property. Said fee may be amended from time to time by action of the village board. 
(d)  Payments. There shall be no connection fee charge for existing connections. Connection fee payments for future connections where only one meter is utilized to provide water service, shall be made in full upon the issuance of a building and/or plumbing permit. Payments for connection fees where there are multiple meters serving multiple tenants or users of the structure shall be paid either in one lump sum or as follows: 
(1)  Twenty-five percent upon the issuance of a building permit. 
(2)  Twenty-five percent upon the granting of an occupancy permit. 
(3)  The remaining charges to be paid out in 12 equal installments, due on or before the first of each month. 
(4)  If any of the monthly payments are not paid when due, then the entire amount shall immediately become due and become a lien against the property that shall be placed upon the tax bill for the property. Interest of one and one-half percent shall be assessed on the entire amount due and owing. The interest shall be calculated from the date of issuance of the building permit. An administrative fee of ten percent of the amount placed upon the tax bill shall also be assessed. 
(e)  Definition. For purposes of this section, residential equivalent connection shall mean a unit of measure for sewer connection fees, equivalent to the amount of water capacity needed to supply one residential dwelling unit. An REC, as used herein, shall be equal to 54,750 gallons per year. 
(f)  Payment of fees. All sewer connection fees shall be paid to the village clerk prior to the issuance of a building or plumbing permit, or connection to the waste or sewage system, whichever is earlier. 
(g)  Appeal procedure. 
(1)  The filing of an appeal does not allow for the issuance of a building permit or otherwise stay the collection of the sewer connection fee unless a bond or other sufficient surety (as determined by the village attorney) has been filed and then only if the non-payment of the sewer connection fee is the sole reason that the plumbing or building permit cannot be issued. 
(2)  Request for initial review. Any person aggrieved by a decision as to the amount or the extent of an sewer connection fee may have the amount of and/or extent of the sewer connection fee reviewed by filing a request for initial review with the village clerk within 30 days of notification of the amount of and/or extent of the sewer connection fee for the property involved. The request for initial review shall state the grounds upon which the aggrieved person contends that the determination should be modified or reversed. Failure to make a request for initial review shall not preclude the aggrieved person from filing a request for administrative review. The village clerk shall forward the request for initial review to the village official that made the initial determination for which a review is being sought. The village official shall review the request for initial review within ten days and provide to the aggrieved a written determination as to whether the initial decision is affirmed, modified or reversed, as well as provide the reasons therefore. The determination shall be dated and shall advise such person of his/her right to have the determination reviewed by a request for administrative review, as set forth below. 
(3)  Request for administrative review. If an individual objects to the imposition of a sewer connection fee or the amount of a sewer connection fee, then the individual may make a request for administrative review. The request for administrative review shall be filed with the village clerk within 60 days of notification of the amount of and/or extent of the sewer connection fee for the property involved (or within 30 days from the issuance of the decision of the request for initial review) and shall be served upon the village clerk in the same manner as a summons and complaint is served in circuit court. The request for administrative review shall be in writing and shall include evidence and argument in support of the applicant's position. 
a.  Upon receipt of the request for administrative review, the village clerk shall immediately notify the village attorney and village president of such request for administrative review. The village president shall appoint, without a need for confirmation, an impartial hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall then be in charge of managing the proceedings. 
b.  At the hearing, the appellant and the village may be represented by counsel and may present evidence and call and examine witnesses and cross-examine witnesses of the other party. Such witnesses shall be sworn by the hearing examiner, who also may provide for the issuing of subpoenas.

(1)  Operation and maintenance (O & M); 
(2)  Administrative; 
(3)  Contributions to a replacement and capital improvement fund; and 
(4)  Debt service, including debt retirement, debt service reserves and coverage requirements. 
The board may establish and modify stormwater utility charges as necessary so as to assure that the charges generate adequate revenues to pay the costs of the stormwater management program and that costs are allocated fairly and proportionately to all parcels in the utility district. 
(Ord. No. 789, § II, 3-7-06) 
Sec. 86-292. - User charges. 
(1)  Each lot or parcel within the utility district shall be subject to a stormwater user charge. This charge shall recover operation, maintenance and capital costs of the utility district. The charge to each parcel shall be based upon the number of ERUs assigned to the parcel. The user charge for each parcel shall be equal to the product of the user charge rate in terms of dollars per ERU, and the number of ERUs assigned to the parcel. The village may also establish special fees, charges or credits as deemed necessary to assure uniform and proportionate allocation of costs to all users. 
(2)  The number of ERUs assigned to each lot or parcel shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  Single-family residential development. Each developed single-family residential lot or parcel shall be assigned one ERU. 
(b)  Nonresidential development. Except as provided for in subparagraph (3), below, for each nonresidential parcel the number of ERUs shall be determined by dividing the total amount of impervious surface area on the lot or parcel by 3,000 square feet. The computed number of ERUs shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.25 ERUs. 
(c)  Existing low-density development. Those parcels with existing impervious surface area as of January 1, 2004, and with impervious surface area constituting less than ten percent of the total area of the lot or parcel, shall be assigned one ERU. If additional impervious surfaces are constructed such that the amount of impervious surface exceeds ten percent of the total area of the lot or parcel, the number of ERUs shall be recomputed for that lot or parcel and the number of ERUs shall be assigned in accordance with subparagraph (2) above. 
(d)  New construction. The construction of new or expanded buildings, driveways, or other structures may result in an increase in the number of ERUs assigned to a lot or parcel. For all nonresidential parcels subject to the user charge, the village shall recalculate the number of ERUs upon completion of new construction or upon the adoption of the annual resolution to assign ERU values for each property within the utility district. The determination of the new impervious area for use in computing the revised ERUs shall be based upon the building permit, visual inspection, aerial photography or any other reasonable method. 
(Ord. No. 789, § II, 3-7-06) 
Sec. 86-293. - Payment. 
(1)  Quarterly billing; due date; penalty. Stormwater charges shall be billed quarterly and shall be payable at the village clerk's office or at any other officially designated location. Statements for such charges and assessments levied or assessed in accordance with this article shall become due and payable within 20 days from and after the date of the statement. If any such statement is not paid when due, a penalty of ten percent will be added thereto. 
(2)  Responsibility for payment. The property owner is held responsible for all stormwater charges on premises that he or she owns. All stormwater bills and notices of any nature relative to the stormwater management service will be addressed to the owner and/or occupant and delivered to the addressee by first class mail. 
(3)  Failure to receive bill, no penalty exemption. Every reasonable care will be exercised in the proper delivery of stormwater bills. Failure to receive a stormwater bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for payment of stormwater charges within the prescribed period nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof. 
(Ord. No. 789, § II, 3-7-06) 
Sec. 86-294. - Delinquent accounts. 
(1)  The Village Board of the Village of Mukwonago adopts W.S.A. § 66.0821(4)(d), by reference. 
(2)  Procedure: 
(a)  The village clerk/treasurer shall, before October 15 of each year, compile a list of all lots or parcels for which stormwater charges are still owed for service supplied in the year preceding October 1. 
(b)  On October 15 in each year, notice shall be given by the village clerk/treasurer to the owner or occupant of all lots or parcels of real estate to which stormwater service has been furnished prior to October 1 and payment for which is owing and in arrears at the time of giving such notice. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state the amount of such arrears, including any penalty assessed pursuant to the rules of the utility district; that unless the delinquent account is paid by November 1 thereafter, a penalty of ten percent of the amount of such arrears will be added thereto; and that unless arrears, with any such added penalty, shall be paid by November 15 thereafter, the same will be levied as a tax against the lot or parcel of real estate to which stormwater service was furnished and for which payment is delinquent. Such notice may be served by delivery to either such owner or occupant personally or by letter addressed to such owner or occupant at the post office addresses of such lot or parcel of real estate. On November 16 the village clerk/treasurer shall certify and file with the clerk/treasurer a list of all lots or parcels of real estate, giving the legal descriptions thereof, to the owners or occupants of which notice of arrears in payment were given as above specified and which arrears still remain unpaid, and stating the amount of such arrears together with the added penalty thereon as herein provided. 
(c)  Each delinquent amount for stormwater service, including penalty, shall thereupon become a lien upon the lot or parcel of real estate to which the stormwater service was furnished and payment for which is delinquent, and the village clerk/treasurer shall insert the same as a tax against such lot or parcel of real estate. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent taxes shall apply to said delinquent tax if the same is not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes upon real estate.

(b)  Boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on the most recent map entitled "Zoning Map - Village of Mukwonago, Wisconsin," which map accompanies and is herein made a part of this chapter. All notations and references shown on the maps are as much a part of this chapter as though specifically described herein. This chapter hereby incorporates herein any future changes or any later zoning maps that may be adopted by ordinance of the village board. 
(c)  The district boundaries in all districts, except the floodplain/shoreland-wetland district shall be construed to follow: corporate limits; U.S. Public Land Survey lines; lot or property lines; centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, easements and railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended. 
(d)  The boundaries of the floodplain/shoreland-wetland district shall be as set forth in division 7 of this article. 
(e)  Vacation of public streets and alleys shall cause the vacated land to be automatically placed in the same district as the abutting side to which the vacated land reverts. 
(f)  Annexations to or consolidations with the village subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall be placed in the A-1 agricultural holding district, unless the annexation ordinance places the land in another district. If the annexation ordinance does not set forth a zoning classification, then, within one year, the village plan commission shall evaluate and recommend a permanent classification to the village board. Annexations containing floodplain/shoreland-wetland districts shall be governed as set forth in division 7 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 572, § I(9.0401), 2-6-96; Ord. No. 931, § I(Exh. A), 6-20-17; Ord. No. 935, § I(Exh. A), 7-18-17) 
Sec. 100-52. - Zoning map. 
    A certified copy of the zoning map shall be adopted and approved with the text as part of this chapter and shall bear upon its face the attestation of the village president and the village clerk and shall be available to the public in the office of the village clerk. Changes thereafter to the general zoning districts shall not become effective until entered and attested on the certified copy. 
(Ord. No. 572, § I(9.0402), 2-6-96) 
Sec. 100-53. - Planned unit development overlay regulations. 
    This section describes the terms and provisions under which a planned unit development overlay is considered and approved, describing regulatory intent, standards and criteria for consideration, status of prior approved planned unit developments, modifications to village development codes that are allowed through this process, modifications to village development codes that are not allowed, approval stages, submittal requirements, criterial for approval of a planned unit development overlay and other provisions to administer consideration and approval. Furthermore, the village may provide additional guidelines to establish a planned unit development overlay. 
(1)  Regulatory Intent. A planned unit development overlay district, as defined under planned unit development in section 100-29, is a regulatory process allowing modifications to a development plan to meet overall community land use goals and density criteria without being bound by exact development standards of an individual zoning district. The process provides a flexible regulatory framework designed to allow developers greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the development of land while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of the comprehensive plan and zoning code. In the Village of Mukwonago, a planned unit development is an overlay district approved as a conditional use which does not appear on the municipal zoning map until a planned unit development overlay district is approved for the development site. 
(2)  Standards and criteria established. Each planned unit development overlay district is approved as a conditional use. Planned unit developments, as defined in section 100-29, are substantially different in character from other conditional uses and for this reason, specific standards and criteria are hereby established to regulate each planned unit development overlay district. The following describe general standards and criteria in the use and approval of a planned unit development overlay district. 
(a)  A minimum property size of two acres is required for a property owner to request a planned unit development overlay district. 
(b)  At time of approval, a planned unit development overlay district shall be in a unified ownership either in a single property or a grouping of properties in the unified ownership. Nothing in the planned unit development overlay district approval shall prevent future land division or sale of all or portions of the development, such as condominium ownership. Approval of a planned unit development overlay district may specify the terms of development phasing and timing of land division or sale. 
(c)  The development type allowed in a planned unit development overlay district shall be consistent with the land use descriptions and policies for the subject property of the village comprehensive plan, and shall be approved with an underlying base zoning district. A planned unit development overlay district may be approved with multiple underlying base zoning districts to improve the orderly development of the unified site, or when other underlying base zoning districts must remain pursuant to other requirements, such as a floodplain district. 
(d)  Uses permitted in a planned unit development overlay district shall conform to uses permitted in the underlying base zoning district or districts. Individual structures shall comply with the specific building area and height requirements of the underlying base zoning district, except when height regulations of the underlying base zoning district allows flexibility via the planned unit development process. All open space of the underlying base zoning district shall be complied with either individually or by providing the combined open space required for the entire development in one or more locations within the development. However, a planned unit development overlay district approved as a business mixed use overlay district or a village center overlay zoning district shall conform to the standards of that specific overlay district as outlined in this chapter 100. 
(e)  All zoning districts allowed in this chapter may be utilized as underlying base zoning district or districts in a planned unit development overlay district, except for residential districts that permit single family development. 
(f)  Approval by the village board, with recommendation from the plan commission, shall include a detailed list of allowed modifications from zoning and other Village Municipal Code requirements along with a detailed list of approved development plans. Each planned unit development shall be further regulated by a developer's agreement. 
(3)  Prior approved planned unit developments. The Village of Mukwonago has allowed prior planned unit developments in specific zoning districts with a specific set of criteria. While planned unit development approval via the prior criteria is no longer an option within this chapter 100; nonetheless, developments approved pursuant to prior criteria remain in good standing if conforming to the plans and standards approved for each specific planned unit development. Any requested change in the approved plans or standards shall be amended through this process of section 100-53. 
(4)  Modifications allowed. To create a unified development that is economically successful to both the developer/owner and the Village, and to require high quality standards for site design, architectural design, landscaping, proper infrastructure, environmental protections and protection of persons and property, modifications to any development standard may be allowed, except for those listed in subsection (5) of this section. With approval of modifications, the village may require aesthetic enhancements to the development design, and may require design enhancements and property maintenance standards for the protection of persons and property. Generally, a typical planned unit development overlay district will involve the following modifications to normal development standards. 
(a)  Setbacks. Building, parking lot and drive aisle setbacks may be modified. With reduced setbacks, the village may require larger setbacks on another part of the property and may require additional landscaping or use of berms, for example, to offset a lesser setback. Through a planned unit development, drive aisle setbacks may be modified or eliminated to promote cross access between adjacent properties in separate ownerships. Approval of a planned unit development may set a minimum standard for distance between buildings within the same planned unit development. 
(b)  Greenspace. Minimum greenspace setbacks may be modified. With reduced setbacks, the village may require larger setbacks on another part of the property and may require additional landscaping or use of berms, or additional or larger parking lot landscaped islands, for example, to offset a lesser setback. 
(c)  On-site parking. Modifications to on-site parking requirements may occur, especially in a unified development where various uses on the site have different parking demand times throughout the day or week and allows shared parking between uses, or when a use of uses on a property have an established lower parking demand than required by the parking standards. Parking modifications may apply to parking space and aisle minimum widths and sizes for uses that display vehicles or equipment. Through planned unit development modifications, the village may establish design standards for any requested parking structure. 
(d)  Architectural design. Modifications to the minimum architectural standards of the underlying zoning district may occur to enhance and provide greater quality to a development than the minimum standards allow, or to enhance an architectural theme of a unified development. 
(e)  Architectural embellishments. In non-residential developments, modifications to building height maximums may occur to provide architectural embellishments, such as a spire or clock tower that is part of an architectural theme. 
(f)  Multiple buildings on a site. Modifications may occur to allow multiple principal buildings on a site and/or to allow buildings normally considered accessory structures, such as clubhouses, pavilions, gazebos, etc. 
(g)  Outdoor display. Modifications may occur to allow outdoor displays of goods for sale within the adjacent principal building. The village may establish standards for location, type, amount and duration of outdoor display. 
(h)  Exterior lighting. Modifications may occur to allow for taller parking lot lighting poles to reduce the amount of light poles needed to provide adequate parking lot light coverage. The village may establish standards for pole and lighting luminaire design. 
(i)  Signage. Modifications may occur to allow for larger individual wall signs and which side of a building wall signs is allowed to increase visibility of a business or businesses in a unified development that is not in a traditional strip-mall design. Modifications may occur to the location and amount of freestanding signs within a unified development. 
(j)  Property size. Modifications may occur to underlying zoning standards for any lot size, width or depth requirement for sites within unified developments that may be divided and sold after approval, such as a satellite lot for an outbuilding within a retail development. This modification allowance also applies to an outlot division to allow for orderly site development, such as an outlot for a storm water management basin or property reserved for future right-of-way purposes. 
(5)  Modifications not allowed. The following standards shall not be modified. 
(a)  Residential dwelling unit density (as described in the underlying zoning district standards as dwelling units per acre). 
(b)  Maximum building height (as described in the underlying zoning district standards as maximum number of stories or maximum height in feet), except when height regulations of the underlying base zoning district allows flexibility via the planned unit development process. 
(c)  Parking lot and aisle width dimensions (within customer and employee parking areas). 
(d)  Building codes and other life safety codes. 
(e)  Village development codes (infrastructure design standards, storm water management and erosion control standards and other environmental protection standards). 
(f)  Required floodplain, wetland or shoreland setbacks. 
(g)  Use within designated floodplains, wetland areas or environmental corridors. 
(6)  Approval Stages. All proposals for planned unit development overlay are submitted and approved in two stages, except under subparagraph (c) below: 
(a)  General development plan. The first stage is a general development plan which shows the entire property holding. The general development plan shows the general locations of buildings or building envelopes, common open spaces, parking and drive areas, principal landscape features and all public infrastructure planned for the entire unified development site. If the development is proposed to occur in phases, sequence of development should be indicated. It is recognized that general development plans are often submitted prior to the identification of the ultimate land user or the specific land uses. 
(b)  Detailed or final development plan. The second stage is a detailed or final development plan which shows detailed plans and information for that portion of a project which is intended for construction in the near future. Frequently detailed plans are submitted for only those portions of the total project area shown in the general development plan which are planned for immediate development. Subsequent phases of development are shown in separate detailed plans prepared at the time of development. 
(c)  With any proposed planned unit development overlay with a unified property size of five acres or less, the applicant may choose to go directly to detailed or final development plan approval. In this case, the requirements for submittal and review for a general development plan and a detailed or final development plan shall be combined. 
(7)  Submittal requirements. 
(a)  General development plan. 
1.  A site map drawn to a scale of 1? equals 100' or greater, showing existing topography and vegetation.

(d)  The proposed development must not result in diminishment of property values of adjoining or nearby properties. 
(e)  Existing and planned street and highway improvements are adequate to handle the projected volumes of traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(f)  There is adequate capacity in the public sanitary sewer and stormwater sewer system to handle projected demand. 
(g)  The proposed circulation system and the design and layout of utilities have taken into account existing and potential streets and utility systems on adjoining parcels. 
(h)  The extent of paving, drainage, patterns or topographic modifications will not disrupt natural drainage patterns on adjoining or nearby sites or otherwise result in environmental damage to downstream areas. 
(9)  Application procedure and required information. 
(a)  Preliminary staff consultation. A petitioner shall have a preliminary consultation with the village administrator and such other village staff and consultants that the administrator deems needed and appropriate to conduct a preliminary review of the application.

a.  The maximum density of multiple family dwellings allowed as a permitted use shall be five dwelling units per acre. 
b.  The maximum density of two-family dwellings within a complex of buildings allowed as a permitted use shall be five dwelling units per acre. 
c.  Density shall be the number of dwelling units on the developed property divided by net size of the lot or property, resulting in a coefficient of dwelling units per acre. The net property size is the gross size of the property at time of application for development minus any public right-of-way existing before development, and minus 50 percent of total area covered by designated environmental features. Designated environmental features are areas delineated as wetlands and verified as wetlands by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources or the Army Corps of Engineers; Primary Environmental Corridors and Secondary Environmental Corridors as verified by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission; floodplains mapped locally or by the FEMA; and land that is permanently or temporarily submerged by water but not including new storm water management and/or water quality basins constructed for the development. Land areas that contain multiple environmental features, such as wetlands within a floodplain, are not double counted. This 50 percent standard only determines the allowable maximum density and should not be construed to allow construction within or removal of any designated environmental features unless permitted by the agency with jurisdiction of the feature. Further division of a lot and/or property by a condominium plat does not change the density calculation of using the gross or net size of the original lot or property.

1.  Taking into consideration the specific land(s) involved, the plan commission may require an analysis of existing and potential traffic patterns and the use of adjacent and/or surrounding properties and may recommend stringent setback, parking, landscaping and other aesthetic related zoning standards. 
2.  Density shall not exceed 20 dwelling units per acre and shall be specifically designed for senior citizens (those persons aged 55 years or older). Projects shall include such features as central locked lobby entrances; common rooms/areas on each floor and wing within a building; elevators; wider hallways with hand railings; walking paths and outdoor sitting areas; and programs and activities designed for the elderly. 
3.  At least 80 percent of all units shall be rented or sold to senior citizens. The building design will conform to the multiple-family requirements of this section; although, the board of zoning and building appeals may waive or change requirements to allow for congregate living. 
(4)  Density. 
a.  The maximum density of multiple family dwellings allowed as a permitted use shall be ten dwelling units per acre. 
b.  Density shall be the number of dwelling units on the developed property divided by net size of the lot or property, resulting in a coefficient of dwelling units per acre. The net property size is the gross size of the property at time of application for development minus any public right-of-way, and minus 50 percent of total area covered by designated environmental features. Designated environmental features are areas delineated as wetlands and verified as wetlands by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources or the Army Corps of Engineers; Primary Environmental Corridors and Secondary Environmental Corridors as verified by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission; floodplains mapped locally or by the FEMA; and land that is permanently or temporarily submerged by water but not including new storm water management and/or water quality basins constructed for the development (see section 100-111). Land areas that contain multiple environmental features, such as wetlands within a floodplain, are not double counted. This 50 percent standard only determines the allowable maximum density and should not be construed to allow construction within or removal of any designated environmental features unless permitted by the agency with jurisdiction of the feature. Further division of a lot and/or property by a condominium plat does not change the density calculation of using the gross or net size of the original lot or property.

Designated environmental features are areas delineated as wetlands and verified as wetlands by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources or the Army Corps of Engineers; Primary Environmental Corridors and Secondary Environmental Corridors as verified by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission; floodplains mapped locally or by the FEMA; and land that is permanently or temporarily submerged by water but not including new storm water management and/or water quality basins constructed for the development (see section 100-111). Land areas that contain multiple environmental features, such as wetlands within a floodplain, are not double counted. This 50 percent standard only determines the allowable maximum density and should not be construed to allow construction within or removal of any designated environmental features unless permitted by the agency with jurisdiction of the feature. Further division of a lot and/or property by a condominium plat does not change the density calculation of using the gross or net size of the original lot or property.

Sec. 100-153. - Village center overlay zoning district. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this village center overlay zoning district is to establish uniform zoning standards to accommodate pedestrian oriented retail businesses and other uses located in a multi-purpose environment within the center of the Village of Mukwonago; that recognizes the unique character of platting, land use and development within the village center; and that necessitates specialized standards to sustain a unique place. This overlay district is further intended to supersede standards of the base zoning district that allows an intensively developed, compact area consisting primarily of retail businesses with multi-purpose development where appropriate and maintains the surrounding residential neighborhood supporting the unique village center. 
(b)  Boundary of village center overlay zoning district. The standards of village center overlay zoning district within this section 100-153 shall apply to and include properties as shown on the map marketed as "Exhibit 1" on file in the office of the village clerk, with the following general boundaries: 
(1)  North: Washington Avenue, extending to include the Pearl and Grand Avenue Historic District. 
(2)  East: Canadian National Railroad Tracks. 
(3)  South: Mukwonago River. 
(4)  West: Shore Line of Lower Phantom Lake. 
(c)  Scope of regulations. The provisions of this section 100-153 shall be in effect on a property or properties within the boundary of the village center overlay zoning district under any of following conditions: 
(1)  Change in use. When the existing use of any building, structure or land is changed to a new permitted use or conditional use in accordance with section 100-153(f), all provisions of this section 100-158 shall apply to the new use. In a building or structure with multiple uses or tenants, the new use shall conform to section 100-153(f) without impacting any existing business or businesses existing in the same building or structure. If any existing use not allowed as a permitted use or conditional use by section 100-153(f) located in the same building or structure with a new use as of June 29, 2017, the existing use may continue as a non-conforming use until the use vacates the building or structure. 
(2)  Enlargement of use. The provisions of this section 100-158 shall apply when the intensity of use of any building, structure, or land is increased through additional floor area, seating capacity or additional residential dwelling units. However, buildings and structures with a use currently existing and permitted in the base zoning district as of June 29, 2017 that is not allowed as a permitted use or conditional use by section 100-153(f) may be allowed to enlarge in accordance with the bulk standards of this section 100-153(g), and the non-conforming use may remain. Any new use occupying the enlargement shall conform to all standards of this section 100-153. 
(3)  New construction. The provisions of this section 100-153 shall apply to all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land (including the construction of new parking and loading facilities) established after June 29, 2017. 
(4)  Pre-existing residential uses. Buildings and structures with residential as the primary use existing at the time of adoption of this section 100-153 within the B-1, B-2 or M-1 base zoning district, and located within the boundary of this overlay district, may continue in a residential use and shall be allowed to make building and property improvements to maintain proper habitation. 
(5)  Benefit of property ownership. Any property owner may select to comply with this section 100-153 at any time, regardless of the other scope of regulations of this section 100-153(c). 
(6)  Application of M-1 or M-2 zoning within the multi-purpose perimeter sub-district. Properties with the base zoning district of M-1 or M-2 within the multi-purpose perimeter sub-district shall request and receive a zoning district boundary change to either the B-1 or B-2 zoning district before any enlargement of use or new construction. The use or uses shall be subject to B-1 or B-2 standards with the optional standards of this village center overlay zoning district. 
(d)  Sub-districts of the village center overlay zoning district. To achieve the intent of the village center overlay district and to recognize the historic development pattern of the village center with a core of retail establishments, sub-districts are created as shown on Exhibit A; on file in the office of the village clerk. The sub-districts of the village center overlay district are as follows: 
(1)  Retail center. 
(2)  Multi-purpose perimeter. 
(3)  Residential perimeter. 
(e)  Purpose of the Sub-Districts. Administration of the allowable uses, performance standards and bulk standards of this section 100-153 shall be based on the following purpose statements of each sub-district in addition to the overall intent statement of the village center overlay zoning district. 
(1)  Retail center. It is the purpose of the retail center to create street level activity by permitting a range of businesses on the ground floor or first floor space of buildings facing the public street primarily of retail character that sell or provide services directly to customers on the premises or serves as a third-place establishment. Businesses that do not create customer traffic are encouraged to locate within the retail center on upper floors or the ground floor or first floor space of buildings that do not face the public street. Nonetheless, businesses without customer traffic may be allowed by approval of the plan commission if the business adds significance to the village center; such as the business is an employment generator, the aesthetic appeal of the business or the building in which the business is located, or the existing floor plan of the building or tenant space is designed for an office environment. Residential dwelling units are encouraged on the upper floors of the retail center. Several buildings within the retail center may be encouraged to remain to enhance the cultural heritage of the village while other buildings are encouraged to be redeveloped or expanded. In addition, it is the purpose of the retail center to preserve the two buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and to promote the cultural heritage of the Village of Mukwonago by maintaining buildings and uses that have been and will continue to be important elements within the village center. 
(2)  Multi-purpose perimeter. It is the purpose of the multi-purpose perimeter to create a mixture of business uses (such as retail, third-places, office services and corporate offices) combined with residential at higher densities than allowed elsewhere in the village creating a consistent activity level and a market for the retail center and the multi-purpose perimeter. Facing the major traffic corridors of Rochester Street and Main Street, businesses located on the ground floor or first floor of buildings shall meet the same criteria as the retail center with the purpose of creating street level activity; except by approval of the plan commission if the business adds significance to the village center; such as the business is an employment generator, the aesthetic appeal of the business or the building in which the business is located, or the existing floor plan of the building or tenant space is designed for an office environment. Several buildings within the multi-purpose perimeter may be encouraged to remain to enhance the cultural heritage of the village while other properties are encouraged to be redeveloped or expanded. Conversion of existing homes to low intensity business uses is encouraged (such as professional offices and bed and breakfast establishments). 
(3)  Residential perimeter. It is the purpose of the residential perimeter to preserve and protect the important residential areas surrounding the business center of the village by identifying the Pearl and Grand Avenue Historic District and allowing homes to be maintained and improved that otherwise are non-conforming pursuant to the required setbacks of the base zoning districts. 
(f)  Allowable uses within sub-districts. The standards within this section 100-153(f) shall apply to uses allowed as permitted uses or conditional uses per sub-district of the village center overlay zoning district, as permitted uses and conditional uses are administered in this chapter 100. Uses specifically prohibited per sub-district are listed as not permitted. 
(1)  General list of allowable or not permitted uses. The following general categories of uses are allowed per sub-district as permitted uses or conditional uses, or not permitted, within the criteria and performance standards of this section 100-153(f).

Common terms for a business under this category may include retail or commercial establishment, a business office, general service, health care, and accommodation, food service or drinking establishments. Third-place businesses are encouraged that provide an alternate to community citizens beyond home and employment to congregate, meet and enjoy the presence of friends and other members of the community.

A business without on-site customers shall have regular and consistent hours of operation at the location of the business in relation to other village center businesses without on-site customers. Common terms for a business under this category may include a business office, office research, general service, health care and social assistance. Nonetheless, businesses without customer traffic may be allowed by approval of the plan commission if the business adds significance to the village center; such as the business is an employment generator, the aesthetic appeal of the business or the building in which the business is located, or the existing floor plan of the building or tenant space is designed for an office environment. 
c.  A ground floor or 1 st floor use facing street means a use with an exterior building wall side facing or along a public right-of-way, which is partially or fully below street level or is at street level.

(5)  Performance standards for a temporary use. The intent of this section is to accommodate reasonable requests for interim, temporary or seasonal use within an enclosed building when such activities are desirable and beneficial for the community for limited periods of time. Examples of a temporary use include a health clinic and temporary inoculation center, seasonal sales or display, and use of a temporarily vacant business space for a short term use such as an art gallery or seasonal sales of decorations. Allowance of temporary uses does not supersede regulations pertaining to specific temporary uses included in other code sections of chapter 100, or other building and health and safety codes. No construction activity or building alterations shall occur to facilitate the temporary use. The zoning administrator may take actions to cease operation of any temporary use that does not conform to the standards of this paragraph.

The shared parking may be the parking of any other use inside or outside of the village center overlay zoning district. 
(2)  Credit for parking spaces which are the subject to a shared parking agreement shall be applicable only when the parties to the agreement are property owners whose property uses have parking demands which are inconsistent with each other (i.e. daytime v. evening, weekdays v. Saturday and/or Sunday). The total off-street parking requirements of the parties of the shared parking agreement may exceed the total number of off-street parking spaces available.

Every property within the village center has a base zoning district that establishes the primary type and intensity of land use for the property, along with development regulations of this chapter 100 for that particular type and intensity of land use for the property. The standards within this section 100-153 apply to all properties of the village center overlay zoning district in lieu of the type and intensity of land use and the development regulations of the base zoning district. If situations arise of the type and intensity of land use and with property maintenance that are not addressed within the standards of the village center overlay zoning district, development regulations of the base zoning district and this chapter 100 shall apply. However, any aspect of the development regulations of the base zoning district or chapter 100 not addressed in the village center overlay zoning district may conflict with and restrict a new use, redevelopment or new development that otherwise meets the intent of, is permitted in, and conforms to other standards of the village center overlay zoning district. When a conflict in regulation is identified, upon finding that the intent of the village center overlay zoning district is maintained, the plan commission may waive the conflicting regulation or establish alternative criteria for the new use, redevelopment or new development to adhere to. 
(2)  The bulk standards of lot size and lot width and/or frontage of section 100-153(g) supersede any similar requirement of chapter 45, land division, of this Code. 
(3)  Including standards elsewhere within this section 100-153 addressing nonconforming uses, the following shall apply to nonconforming uses. 
a.  Any businesses currently existing and permitted in the base zoning district as of June 29, 2017 that may not be allowed as a permitted use or a conditional use within the sub-district of this village center overlay zoning district may nonetheless continue within the existing space, and shall be allowed to continue to improve the business, such as façade improvements and change of and use of signs in compliance with chapter 64. However, the floor space of a nonconforming business shall not be expanded. If the business vacates the floor space, or if an existing business changes its business model, the new business occupying the floor space shall be either a permitted use or a conditional use with the sub-district. 
b.  A building with a use or uses that may not be allowed as a permitted use or a conditional use within the sub-district of this village center overlay zoning district may nonetheless expand without changing the nonconforming use or uses. However, occupancy of the expansion must be a permitted use or a conditional use within the sub-district. An example of this occurrence is if a building in the retail center sub-district is expanded or remodeled on the upper floors to add residential dwelling units. In that case, any nonconforming 1 st floor business use may remain. 
c.  A building with a use or uses that may not be allowed as a permitted use or a conditional use within the sub-district of this village center overlay zoning district may nonetheless complete façade improvements without changing the nonconforming use or uses. 
(4)  The terms existing use, existing condition or similar term means the property use or uses, building, or conditions that existed at the time of adoption of this section 100-153. 
(5)  Within this section 100-153, the terms building and structure are applied interchangeably. 
(6)  The zoning administrator shall be responsible for administration of this section 100-153, along with the plan commission when site plan or architectural plan approval are required. The zoning administrator may refer any matter pertaining to the interpretation of any standard this section 100-513 to the plan commission for advice or recommendation.

(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  Title. This ordinance shall be known as the "Floodplain Districts and Standards for the Village of Mukwonago, Wisconsin". 
(e)  General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see section 100-278, amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the village zoning administrator of the Village of Mukwonago. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
a.  Official maps. Based on the flood insurance study (FIS) volume number 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C and 55133CV003C, dated November 5, 2014, for village lands within Waukesha County, and FIS volume number 55127CV000B for village lands within Walworth County: 
1.  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0314G, 55133C0318G, 55133C0426G, 55133C0427G and 55133C0431G, dated November 5, 2014, for village lands within Waukesha County. 
2.  Waukesha County, Village of Mukwonago; flood storage district map, Panel 11 of 12, dated November 5, 2014, and approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
3.  Zoning map of the Village of Mukwonago, as updated from time to time, on file in the office of the village clerk. 
4.  Other studies that may be produced from time to time as approved by the DNR and FEMA. 
(3)  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The floodway district (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
c.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
d.  The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 100-278, amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 100-277(d) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 100-278, amendments. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 100-278, amendments. 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if W.S.A., § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when W.S.A., § 30.2022, applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under W.S.A., § 61.35 or § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. All references to "this ordinance" within division 7 [of chapter 100] of the Village of Mukwonago Municipal Code shall refer only to the requirements of this division 7. Within this division 7, references to other section numbers shall apply to sections and subsections within this division 7 only, unless otherwise noted. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas. The Waukesha County or Walworth County floodplain zoning provisions, whichever applies, in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

(3)  The character of the river system and the campground elevation are such that a 72-hour warning of an impending flood can be given to all campground occupants; 
(4)  There is an adequate flood warning procedure for the campground that offers the minimum notice required under this section to all persons in the campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator and the chief law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood elevations, types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for notifying at-risk parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for conducting the evacuation; 
(5)  This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which time the agreement shall be reviewed and updated - by the officials identified in subsection (4) - to remain in compliance with all applicable regulations, including those of the state department of health services and all other applicable regulations; 
(6)  Only camping units that are fully licensed, if required, and ready for highway use are allowed; 
(7)  The camping units shall not occupy any site in the campground for more than 180 consecutive days, at which time the camping unit must be removed from the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours; 
(8)  All camping units that remain on site for more than 30 days shall be issued a limited authorization by the campground operator, a written copy of which is kept on file at the campground. Such authorization shall allow placement of a camping unit for a period not to exceed 180 days and shall ensure compliance with all the provisions of this section; 
(9)  The municipality shall monitor the limited authorizations issued by the campground operator to assure compliance with the terms of this section; 
(10)  All camping units that remain in place for more than 180 consecutive days must meet the applicable requirements in either sections 100-273, 100-274, or 100-275 for the floodplain district in which the structure is located; 
(11)  The campground shall have signs clearly posted at all entrances warning of the flood hazard and the procedures for evacuation when a flood warning is issued; and

Sec. 100-275. - Other floodplain districts. 
    Other floodplain districts are established under this ordinance and reflected on the floodplain zoning map. These districts include the general floodplain district and flood storage district. 
(a)  General floodplain district (GFP). 
(1)  Applicability. The provisions for this district shall apply to all floodplains mapped as A, AO or AH zones. 
(2)  Permitted uses. Pursuant to section 100-275(a)(4), it shall be determined whether the proposed use is located within the floodway or floodfringe. 
Those uses permitted in the floodway (section 100-273(b)) and floodfringe (section 100-274(b)) Districts are allowed within the general floodplain district, according to the standards of section 100-275(a)(3), provided that all permits or certificates required under section 100-277(a) have been issued. 
(3)  Standards for development. Section 100-273 applies to floodway areas, section 100-274 applies to floodfringe areas. The rest of this ordinance applies to either district. 
a.  In AO/AH zones the structure's lowest floor must meet one of the conditions listed below whichever is higher: 
1.  At or above the flood protection elevation; or 
2.  Two feet above the highest adjacent grade around the structure; or 
3.  The depth as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  In AO/AH zones, provide plans showing adequate drainage paths to guide floodwaters around structures. 
(4)  Determining floodway and floodfringe limits. Upon receiving an application for development within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator shall: 
a.  Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to the general floodplain district limits, stream channel, and existing floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and floodproofing measures; and the flood zone as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information deemed necessary by the department to evaluate the effects of the proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation and to determine floodway boundaries. 
1.  A hydrologic and hydraulic study as specified in section 100-277(a)(2)(c). 
2.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information; 
c.  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage, water supply and sanitary facilities. 
(b)  Flood storage district. The flood storage district delineates that portion of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher flood elevations. 
(1)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the flood storage district (FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps. 
(2)  Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in section 100-274(c). 
(3)  Standards for development in flood storage districts. 
a.  Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional flood. 
b.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the pre-development ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
c.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district - on this waterway - is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage, as per section 100-278, amendments, of division. 
d.  No area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 887, § I, 10-21-14) 
Sec. 100-276. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  Applicability. If these standards conform with W.S.A., § 59.69(10) for counties or W.S.A., § 62.23(7)(h), for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this ordinance or any amendment thereto. 
(2)  Conditional continuance. The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may continue subject to the following conditions: 
a.  No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this ordinance. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Maintenance is not considered a modification; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not considered maintenance. 
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
b.  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this ordinance; 
c.  The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent; 
d.  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this ordinance.

    Nonconforming structure. An existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this ordinance for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
    Nonconforming use. An existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the floodway.)

    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Unnecessary hardship. Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance. 
    Variance. An authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watershed. The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Water surface profile. A graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

DIVISION 8. - SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING ORDINANCE[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Note- The shoreland-wetland zoning district language had been located in § 100-273. It was determined that the floodplain zoning code and the shoreland-wetland zoning code should be recreated as distinct divisions for ease of use. The authorization, findings of fact and statement of purpose remain the same as when the shoreland-wetland zoning district was created through Ordinance No. 572. 

Sec. 100-282. - Shoreland-wetland zoning district. 
(a)  District boundaries of shoreland-wetlands. 
(1)  The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which are five acres or more in size and are shown on the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this division and which are: 
a.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the department publication Surface Water Resources of Waukesha County or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been made a part of this division. Lakes, ponds and flowages not listed in the publications or maps referenced in this section shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are navigable under the laws of the state following the procedure in subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
b.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this division. Rivers and streams not shown on the maps referenced in this section shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they are navigable under the laws of the state following the procedure found in subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high water mark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high water mark. 
(3)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official zoning maps, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
(4)  Under W.S.A., § 144.26(2m), notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule, wetland zoning ordinances required under W.S.A., § 61.351 and ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:

(2)  Promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by buffering shorelands or waterways (navigable lakes, ponds and flowages) outside of a shoreland protection overlay district needed for grading and conveyance and filtering of stormwater. 
(3)  Protect persons and property from undue hardship by controlling the placement of buildings an appropriate distance away from shorelands, floodplains, wetlands and surrounding bodies of water. 
(b)  Definitions. Specific terms and phases within this section 100-283 shall have the definitions as referenced below: 
    Shoreland. As defined as "shorelands" in section 100-29 of this Code. 
    Principal building means the main building or structure on a single lot or parcel of land, and includes any attached garage, attached porch and attached decks. 
    Accessory structure is defined as accessory use or structure in Section 100-29. 
(c)  District boundaries. The shoreland protection overlay district requirements of this section are standards that apply pursuant to W.S.A., § 61.353, to shoreland annexed to the Village of Mukwonago after May 7, 1982, that prior to annexation was subject to a county shoreland zoning ordinance under W.S.A., § 59.692. The requirements of this shoreland protection overlay district may be more restrictive than the underling zoning district or districts placed on a property; however, the shoreland protection overlay district requirements do not supersede the standards of the floodplain zoning districts of 100-271 through 100-282. In all cases, the more restrictive standards apply. Outside of the district boundaries of the shoreland protection overlay district, the standards of the underlying zoning district apply, except for the setbacks identified in section 100-283(k). The shoreland protection overlay district shall include all lands in the Village of Mukwonago that are within the following distances from the ordinary high water mark of the following navigable waters: 
(1)  One thousand feet of navigable lakes, ponds, or flowages; and 
(2)  Three hundred feet from a river or stream or the landward side of the floodplain, whichever is greater. 
(d)  Mapping of the district boundaries. The shoreland protection overlay district boundary shall apply to all properties within the Village of Mukwonago as described in section 100-283(c) whether mapped or not on the official zoning map of the Village of Mukwonago. When information is available regarding the ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters for properties through prior or new engineering studies, the village board shall strive to at least annually update the zoning map with the shoreland protection overlay district boundary. The mapping of district boundaries also includes the following: 
(1)  Any property annexed or attached to the Village of Mukwonago within the distance of navigable waters as described in section 100-283(c) shall be automatically placed in the shoreland protection overlay district. 
(2)  The shoreland protection overlay district does not include lands adjacent to an artificially constructed drainage pit ditch, pond, or any stormwater management facility which are non-hydrologically connected to a natural navigable body of water. 
(e)  Determination of navigability. A determination of navigability and ordinary high water mark locations shall be made by the village zoning administrator. Lakes, ponds and flowages shall be presumed to be navigable if listed in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Service Water Data, or shown on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps, or other applicable zoning base maps. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if designated as continuous waterways, or intermittent waterways shown on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps. To assist in the determination of navigability, the zoning administrator shall utilize engineering studies and will also seek the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of navigability or for the ordinary high water mark. 
(f)  The building location within the shoreland protection overlay district. 
(1)  Principal building location: 
a.  All principal building shall be located at a minimum distance of 50 feet from the ordinary high water mark or a minimum of 20 feet from a mapped floodplain or identified wetland boundary, which ever distance is greater from the ordinary high water mark. In addition, any principal building shall be located at least two feet above the floodplain elevation. The village plan commission may increase the minimum distance from the principal building from a mapped floodplain or identified wetland due to the size or use intensity of the building, the need to further buffer a sensitive environmental area or the need to provide an increased area for stormwater runoff and water quality from the principal building. 
b.  The principal building may be located at a distance less than required in section 100-283(f)(1)a. if the principal building is constructed or placed in a lot immediately adjacent on each side to a lot containing a principal building and the principal building is constructed or placed within a distance equal to the average distance of the principal buildings on adjacent lots from the ordinary high water mark. However, the minimum distance from the ordinary high water mark shall not be less than 35 feet. 
c.  The minimum distance requirements of sections 100-283(f)(1)a. and 100-283(f)(1)b. shall not allow a principal building to be placed closer to a property line than allowed within the underlying zoning district. 
(2)  Accessory structure location: 
a.  All accessory structures shall be located a minimum distance of 50 feet from the ordinary high water mark or a minimum of 20 feet from the mapped floodplain of identified wetland boundary, whichever distance is greater from the ordinary high water mark. In addition, any accessory structures shall be located at least two feet above the floodplain elevation. The village plan commission may increase the minimum distance for an accessory structure from a mapped floodplain or identified wetland due to size or use intensity of the structure, or are needed to further buffer a sensitive environmental area or the need to provide an increased area for stormwater runoff and water quality from the building. 
b.  The minimum distance requirements of section 100-283(f)(2)a. shall not allow an accessory structure to be placed closer to a property line than allowed within the underlying zoning district. 
(g)  Other minimum distance requirements within the shoreline protection overlay district. 
(1)  All other man made development or construction on a property, such as a parking lot, parking lot access drive, driveway, sidewalk or paved trail, playground equipment, utility or telecommunication equipment, retaining wall, etc., shall be located a minimum distance of 35 feet from the ordinary high water mark, or a minimum of 20 feet from a mapped floodplain or wetland boundary, whichever distance is greater from the ordinary high water mark. The village plan commission may increase the minimum distance for a man made development from a mapped floodplain or identified wetland due to size or use intensity of the structure, needed to further buffer a sensitive environmental area or the need to provide an increased area for stormwater runoff and water quality. 
(2)  The minimum distance requirements of section 100-283(g)(1) shall not allow a man made development or construction building to be placed closer to a property line than allowed within the underlying zoning district or the parking standards of the zoning ordinance. 
(h)  Required buffer zone and maintenance within the shoreland protection overlay district. 
(1)  Any person or entity who owns shoreland property containing vegetation shall maintain a vegetative buffer zone along the entire shoreline of their ownership and extending 35 feet from the ordinary high water mark of navigable water, except as provided for in section 100-283(h)(2) and (3). 
(2)  If the vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or diseased vegetation, the owner of the shoreland property may remove the vegetation. If owner removes all of the vegetation in the vegetative buffer zone, the owner shall establish a vegetative buffer zone with new vegetation. 
(3)  Any person or entity required to maintain or establish a vegetative buffer may remove all of the vegetation in part of the buffer zone in order to establish a viewing or access corridor that is no greater than 30 feet for every 100 feet of shoreline frontage, extending no more than 35 feet from the ordinary high water mark. 
(4)  Not withstanding the requirements of sections 100-283(h)(1) and 100-283(h)(2), any man made development or construction that enhances the recreation and/or open space use and enjoyment of the buffer area may be allowed if permitted by Wisconsin Department of Resources, or allowed by the village zoning administrator if the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources does not have permanent jurisdiction, provided the development or construction is allowed in the underlying zoning district, or any floodplain zoning district. Such development or construction activity may include a wood chip path, stone or wood steps on a steep slope, boardwalk, wood or stone sitting bench, canoe launch, boat dock or bird feeder. 
(i)  Statement of deed restriction and enforcement. The regulations and standards within this section 100-283 may conflict with or be less than private deed restrictions placed upon property within the village by the restrictive covenants or the by the restrictions placed on a plat of subdivision or certified survey map. The Village of Mukwonago does not enforce private deed restrictions. The village zoning administrator shall be responsible for the enforcement of the restrictions and standards of this section 100-283, with assistance from the village building inspector, village attorney and village engineer and village planner. 
(j)  Other floodplain and wetland setbacks. In all zoning districts, all principal buildings, accessory structures, and manmade development or construction shall be located at a minimum of 20 feet from any mapped floodplain or indentified wetland boundary that are not within its shoreland protection overlay district. In addition, any principal building and accessory structure shall be located at least two feet above the floodplain elevation. The village plan commission may increase the minimum standards for a principal building and/or accessory structure from a mapped floodplain or identified wetland due to size or use intensity of the building, needed to further buffer a sensitive environmental area or the need to provide an increased area for stormwater runoff and water quality from the building.

Sec. 100-304. - Historic structure, historic site and historic district designation criteria. 
(a)  For purposes of this chapter, a historic structure, historic site, or historic district designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved, including any building, improvement or structure located thereon, or any area of particular historic, architectural, archeological or cultural significance to the village such as historic structures, sites, or districts which: 
(1)  Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state or community; or 
(2)  Are identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state or local history; or 
(3)  Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or 
(4)  Are representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer or architect who influenced his age; or 
(5)  Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history. 
(b)  The commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for historic structure, historic site and historic district designation, providing such are in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 572, § I(9.1104), 2-6-96) 
Sec. 100-305. - Powers and duties. 
(a)  Designation. The commission shall have the power, subject to section 100-311, to designate historic structures and historic sites and to recommend designation of historic districts within the village limits. Such designations shall be made based on section 100-309. Historic districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration and demolition. 
(1)  No owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic site or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the historic preservation commission. Unless such certificate has been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(2)  Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the commission, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
a.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement or site upon which such work is to be done; 
b.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of the other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district; 
c.  In the case of any property located in a historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for such district; 
d.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the village and state; 
e.  The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture, and/or material that it could not be reproduced without great difficulty and/or expense; 
f.  In the case of a request for a demolition permit, the denial of the permit would result in the loss of all reasonable and beneficial use of or return from the property; or 
g.  In the case of a request for the demolition of a deteriorated building or structure, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair; 
h.  The owner of the historic property submits information that the denial of the certificate of appropriateness will deprive the owner of all reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. 
(3)  In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following standards: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
i.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(4)  If the commission determines that the application for a certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district, and with the above guidelines, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the building inspector. The commission shall make this decision within 45 days of the filing of the application. 
(5)  Agencies of the village and all public utility and transportation companies, undertaking projects affecting historic structures, historic sites or historic districts, shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures and buildings on property, easements or streets owned or franchised by the village. 
(6)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the village. A building permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to a historic structure, historic site or improvement in a historic district designated under this article, any provision of the plumbing code, electrical code, or building or housing code of the village shall apply, unless waived by the appropriate state or village appeals body. 
(7)  Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started within 12 months after the issuance of the certificate, and the work shall conform to the provisions of the certificate. The village may inspect the work during and after construction in order to assure compliance. Failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate of appropriateness shall be a violation of this article. In addition to the other penalties and remedies, the village shall issue a stop work order, and all work shall cease on the designated property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. 
(8)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness, provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  Appeals. Should the commission fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the village board within 30 days. In addition, if the commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this article. 
(d)  Recognition of historic structures, sites and districts. At such time as a historic structure, site or district has been properly designated, the commission may cause to be prepared and erected on such property at village expense a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic structure, site or district. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing pedestrians. The plaque shall state the accepted name of the historic property, the date of its construction of significance, and other information deemed proper by the commission. 
(e)  Other duties. In addition to those duties already specified in this article, the commission shall: 
(1)  Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historical heritage of the village and the historic properties designated under the provision of this article. 
(2)  Cooperate with the State of Wisconsin historic preservation officer and the state historic preservation review board in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as landmarks or landmark sites, or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and the state register of historic places. 
(3)  As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of historic preservation in the village. Such funds shall be placed in a special village account for such purpose.

Sec. 100-306. - Procedures. 
(a)  Designation of historic structures and historic sites. 
(1)  The commission may, after notice and public hearing, designate historic structures and historic sites, or rescind such designation or recommendation, after application of the criteria in section 100-304 above. At least ten days prior to such hearing, the commission shall notify the owners of record, as listed in the office of the village assessor, who are owners of property in whole or in part situated within 200 feet of the boundaries of the property affected. These owners shall have the right to confer with the commission prior to final action by the commission on the designation. Notice of such hearing shall also be published as Class 1 notice, under the Wisconsin Statutes. The commission shall also notify the following: department of public works, parks division, fire and police departments, health department, building inspector, and plan commission. Each such department may respond to the commission with its comments on the proposed designation or rescission. 
(2)  The commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary. The commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission. Within ten days after the close of the public hearing, the commission may designate the property as either a historic structure or historic site, or rescind the designation. After the designation or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner or owners. Notification shall also be given to the village clerk, building inspector, plan commission, and the village assessor. The commission shall cause the designation or rescission to be recorded, at village expense, in the county register of deeds office, or the recommendation to be submitted to the village board as provided by subsection 100-309(c). 
(b)  Designation of historic districts. 
(1)  For preservation purposes, the historic preservation commission shall select geographically defined areas within the village to be designated as historic districts and shall, with the assistance of the plan commission, prepare a historic preservation plan in ordinance form for each area. A historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the village which: 
a.  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state or community; or 
b.  Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state or local history; or

e.  Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to history or prehistory. 
(2)  Guideline criteria to be considered in the development of historic district plans are as follows: 
a.  Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration and demolition shall conform to the criteria and standards in section 100-305(b)(1), (2) and (3). 
b.  All new structures shall be constructed to a height visually compatible with the building and environment with which they are visually related. 
c.  The gross volume of any new structure shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
d.  In the street elevation of a building, the proportion between the width and height in the facade shall be visually compatible with the building and environment with which it is visually related. 
e.  The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in the street facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
f.  The rhythm of solids to voids, created by openings in the facade, should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
g.  The existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them should be preserved. 
h.  The materials used in the final facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
i.  The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
j.  Colors and patterns used on the facade (especially trim) should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
k.  The design of the roof should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
l.  The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual building, its occupants and their needs. Further, the landscape treatment should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related. 
m.  The street facade should blend with other buildings via directional expression. When adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or vertical expression, this expression should be carried over and reflected. 
n.  Architectural elements should be incorporated as necessary to relate the new with the old and to preserve and enhance the inherent characteristics of the area. 
o.  Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the historic preservation commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(3)  Review and adoption procedure:

(b)  Application of parking requirements. The requirements of this article shall apply to all new site development, new or existing parking lots or changes in occupancy or use as provided for in this section. 
(1)  Similar use interpretation. In the case of uses not specifically enumerated in subsection 100-402(a), the minimum number of parking spaces specified as the general standard for the use classification or number of spaces specified for similar use shall apply. The zoning administrator shall be authorized to make a preliminary determination and has the discretion to refer any such request to the plan commission for determination. 
(2)  Change in use or occupancy of a building, structure or land. 
a.  When the use or occupancy of building, structure or land changes to a new use, another use or a new occupant, additional on-site parking spaces shall be constructed if the new use, another use or new occupant requires a minimum amount of on-site parking spaces pursuant to subsection 100-402(a) more than already exists on the subject site. 
b.  When a building or structure is expanded, additional parking spaces shall be constructed if the expansion requires a minimum amount of on-site parking spaces pursuant to subsection 100-402(a) more than already exists on the subject site. 
c.  When a building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of this article, additional minimum parking spaces or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements of the new use or occupancy exceed those for the existing or prior use or occupancy. 
d.  When site constraints and/or other standards of this chapter do not allow proper space to provide for the minimum amount of required on-site parking spaces for a change in use or occupancy of a building, structure or land as stated above, the plan commission may, at its discretion, grant an exemption to the requirement of constructing additional parking spaces. The applicant requesting a change in use or occupancy shall demonstrate how site constraints and/or other standards of this chapter do not allow construction of additional on-site parking spaces, and shall provide justification that there are sufficient off-site parking spaces available for overflow parking, such as street parking or shared parking on neighboring or nearby properties. 
e.  When a new use, another use or a new occupancy in an existing nonresidential multitenant building, structure or unified development, combined with the parking spaces required for other tenants on the subject property, requires additional on-site parking spaces beyond the number of on-site parking spaces already constructed, the plan commission may, at its discretion, grant an exception to the requirement of constructing additional parking spaces. The applicant requesting a change in use or occupancy shall demonstrate that other uses in the multitenant building, structure or unified development have variable parking needs and demands throughout the business day so that timeframe of peak demand for parking of the new use or occupant does not conflict with the timeframe of peak demand for parking of other tenants. The property owner shall provide written confirmation to the plan commission of concurrence with the request. For purposes of this paragraph, a multitenant building, structure or unified development means a property occupied by multiple leaseholders each with its own public entrance from the exterior of the building or structure, or through a shared lobby, atrium, mall or hallway and separated from other tenant spaces by walls or a separate building. 
(3)  Potential parking reductions. 
a.  Reduction in area to be paved at time of parking lot installation or renovation. The plan commission may authorize as much as a 40-percent reduction in the area to be paved for off-street parking stalls at the request of the applicant. If a reduction is requested, technical documentation shall be furnished by the applicant during the site plan review process to indicate, to the satisfaction of the plan commission, that actual off-street parking demand for that particular use is less than the required amount. 
b.  Reserve off-street parking area to be shown on site plan. Sufficient area on the property shall be held in reserve for the potential future development of paved off-street parking to meet the full requirements. This reserve off-street parking area shall be shown and noted on the site plan, maintained as open space, and developed with paved off-street parking spaces when the village determines that such off-street parking is necessary due to parking demand on the property which exceeds original expectations. The reserve parking area shall not be counted as part of any required greenspace area. The plan commission may require that a letter of credit or other approved financial surety be provided at the time of permit issuance in the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of parking lot completion, to be exercised at village discretion, should the need for parking lot completion be determined. 
c.  Satellite lots exempt. Notwithstanding the above, satellite lots may be allowed to have a reduction in parking area without keeping additional area in reserve, if in the opinion of the plan commission, parking with neighboring uses can be easily shared and provisions are made for safe pedestrian paths between parking areas 
(4)  Application to existing lots. Application of all standards within this article to existing parking lots may be subject to adjustments relative to the shape and size of the existing parking lot and other current conditions. 
(5)  Garage spaces. Enclosed or partially enclosed parking spaces whether in a detached garage, attached garage or parking structure shall count toward the fulfillment of the minimum amount of required parking spaces if the garage spaces are properly accessible to internal site circulation and external public right-of-way; and if the garage spaces are available at no cost to customers, employees or guests of the use (except for private residential garages). 
(c)  Procedure for parking lot review and approval. 
(1)  Plan commission approval. Any parking lot for a new or expanded development or new or expanded use of land that require site plan review pursuant to section 100-601, or require planned unit development or conditional use approval, shall be forwarded to the plan commission for review and approval. The plan commission shall review the parking lot plan for compliance with this article and other applicable provisions of chapter 100 and the municipal Code and shall make determinations of interpretations, deviation or exception when necessary. The zoning administrator shall have the discretion to refer other parking lots for review and approval prior to issuance of a permit for parking lot construction. 
(2)  Depiction on required site plan. Any and all parking and traffic circulation areas proposed to be located on the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan required for the development or expansion of the subject property. The site plan shall be drawn to scale. 
(3)  Other required plan information. The site plan for a new or expanded parking lot shall be accompanied by the following information for proposed parking lot improvements. 
a.  Exterior lighting plan shall be presented to include drawings or copy of catalog design of the lights and or luminaries, the type and height of light poles, a plan for light pole locations, and a full photometric plan to illustrate proposed lighting design and levels. See section 100-601 for exterior lighting standards. 
b.  Drainage and grading plans shall be presented to conform to stormwater management and water quality requirements of village municipal Code and to provide for practical and appropriate parking lot drainage without ponding. 
c.  Landscaping plan shall be presented indicating proposed landscape features, including the location, size and species of proposed landscaping, and showing existing trees and landscaping to be retained. The landscaping plan shall conform to the minimum standards of subsection 100-402(f)(6) and the minimum standards for landscaping as required within the specific zoning district of the subject property. 
d.  Associated parking lot features shall be presented, including, but not limited to, landscaped islands; curb and gutter; stop signs and other directional signage; handicapped/bicycle ramps between the lot and adjoining sidewalks, designated pedestrian routes and pavement markings showing parking spaces, handicapped spaces, pedestrian cross walks and stop lines. 
e.  All or part of the information to be presented on a site plan for a new or expanded parking lot may be waived by the zoning administrator if a small size of the new or expanded lot does not merit the improvements. 
(d)  Parking lot size may be limited. It is the village's intent to enhance stormwater management by limiting excessive impervious surfaces; therefore, parking lots in which the number of spaces significantly exceeds the minimum number required under this zoning chapter shall be allowed only with specific and reasonable justification. 
(e)  Reduction in paved area for parking with use of shared parking. To reduce the amount of increased impervious surface and to maximum resources of site development and parking, an applicant of an use or development at the time of site plan approval or renovation may request the plan commission to approve an exception to providing the full amount of on-site parking area and spaces required by subsection 100-402(a) if the total amount of required parking spaces is offset by available and accessible parking spaces on an adjacent property or properties. The plan commission may grant an exception up to 50 percent of the full on-site parking requirement for any site part of a shared parking arrangement during site plan approval, in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  The plan commission finds that the full amount of parking area and spaces required by subsection 100-402(a) for all uses on the properties subject to the shared parking arrangement are provided and accessible to all uses. 
(2)  The plan commission finds that the timeframe for peak parking demand varies between uses subject to the shared parking arrangement. 
(3)  All property owners' part of the shared parking arrangement shall provide written confirmation to the plan commission of concurrence with the request. 
(4)  Shared parking easements and ingress/egress easements for all parking areas and spaces to be shared between property owners may be required at the discretion of the plan commission or the village board. If required, the easements shall be approved by the village board after recommendation by the plan commission, and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. The easements shall be permanent and shall be transferred with change of property ownership. 
(5)  Driveways, parking areas and parking spaces of adjacent properties with a shared parking arrangement may be allowed to cross property lines and encroach the green space setback as required within the zoning district standards of the subject property. The elimination of the green space setback shall be only along the property line adjacent to the property to which a shared parking agreement is in place. The required green space square footage not provided along the property line due to the share parking agreement in accordance with this paragraph shall be provided elsewhere on the subject site, in addition to the required green space of other property line setbacks. 
(f)  Design of parking lots and parking spaces. Any parking lot for a new or expanded development or new or expanded use shall be designed with the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  Parking lot, parking stall and driveway access. 
a.  Each parking lot shall be appropriately designed to allow for vehicle access and proper turning movements of emergency vehicles, delivery vehicles and other large vehicles. 
b.  All parking lots shall have at least one vehicle access point to a public street and shall be shown on the site plan. 
c.  All parking lot vehicle access points with local streets shall be reviewed and approved by the plan commission. All access points with a county highway shall be reviewed by the plan commission with final approval by the appropriate county highway authority. All access points with a state highway shall be reviewed by the plan commission with final approval by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. 
d.  The number and location of parking lot vehicle access points may be limited by the appropriate authority in the interest of public safety and acceptable transportation engineering standards. 
e.  Throat length of parking lot vehicle access shall be of an appropriate length for proper stacking of entering/exiting vehicles to promote safe internal and external vehicle circulation and turning movements. Throat length may be regulated by the county or state highway authorities. 
f.  Each parking stall shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway designed to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a public right-of-way. 
g.  Each parking stall shall be designed with direct access to an aisle or driveway having a safe and clear route to a public right-of-way. 
(2)  Parking stall and aisle minimum dimensions, for non-handicapped stalls. 
a.  Minimum area: One hundred eighty square feet. 
b.  Minimum width for all standard stalls: Nine feet. 
c.  Minimum width for angled stalls: Ten feet. 
d.  Minimum width for parallel parking stalls: Eight feet. 
e.  Minimum parking lot aisle width: Twenty-four feet, except may be reduced with one-way angled parking stalls to generally acceptable standard for the angle of parking. 
(3)  Handicapped parking for the disabled. Handicapped parking spaces for use by disabled persons shall be provided in accordance to the number and size required by federal and State of Wisconsin rules. 
(4)  Location, proximity and setbacks. 
a.  Required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use except for shared parking arrangements. Required parking spaces shall not be located more than 500 feet from the exterior property line of the principal use. 
b.  No vehicle use area shall be located in any required green space setback of the zoning district of the subject property, except for the following: 
1.  Driveways may cross the green space setback as close to a 90-degree angle as reasonably practicable for ingress/egress to the subject property. 
2.  When permitting circulation between adjacent properties or to accommodate shared parking arrangements, driveways may cross required greenspace setbacks. 
3.  When permitting shared parking arrangements in accordance with the standards of subsection 100-402(e) and the shared parking is connected across property lines, green space setbacks may be eliminated or reduced with 100 percent replacement of the green space elsewhere on the subject site. 
c.  Curb and gutter outlining a driveway or parking lot shall not be included within the required green space setback. However, where parking spaces with curb and gutter abut the green space setback, the parking space may be designed so that a vehicle can overhang the green space. 
(5)  Off-street parking construction. 
a.  Surfacing. All vehicle use areas (loading docks, driveways, parking lot aisles and parking spaces) shall be surfaced with a durable asphalt or Portland cement pavement of a minimum of two inches of asphalt or four inches of concrete to provide a dust free surface at all times. In the alternative, a porous pavement or another durable pavement type that assists with on-site storm water management and water quality run-off may be utilized, as approved by the village engineer. 
b.  Required curb and gutter. All vehicle use areas with parking for 20 or more vehicles on a subject property, shall be constructed with full concrete and gutter surrounding the vehicle use areas (both driveways and parking areas); except the plan commission may waive the requirement of curb and gutter if an existing parking lot is expanded that does not have curb and gutter. Gaps in the curbing may occur to facilitate property parking lot drainage. 
c.  Grading. All vehicle use areas shall be graded to properly drain of all surface water in accordance with the village storm water management standards, and as approved by the village engineer. 
d.  Striping. All vehicle use areas with more than five parking spaces shall have the aisles and spaces clearly marked and striped in accordance with the standards of subsection 100-402(f)(2). 
e.  Timeline. Permanent surfacing of vehicle use areas and curb and gutter, if required, shall be completed before the granting of occupancy for the use or uses for which the vehicle use areas are provided. Except the building inspector may grant temporary occupancy if weather conditions during the late fall to early spring seasons do not allow installation of the permanent surface and curb and gutter; however a solid surface of gravel must be provided. The plan commission or the building inspector may require a timeframe in which to complete surfacing after temporary occupancy is granted. 
(6)  Off-street parking area interior landscaping requirements. 
a.  Applicability. The interior parking lot landscaping standards of this subsection shall apply to all off-street parking lots and their related vehicular use areas containing 20 or more parking spaces. 
b.  Design requirements. 
1.  The intent of this subsection is to require large, beneficial landscaped planting areas or peninsulas within vehicular use areas (parking lots, driveways, drive aisles, etc.). Landscaping between the vehicular use area and the building may be counted toward meeting up to 50 percent of the requirement, however the remaining landscaped area must be located within the vehicular use area itself, and not adjacent to the building. 
2.  A minimum of 15 square feet of interior landscaping shall be provided per parking stall. 
3.  The interior landscaping shall be provided within planting islands or peninsulas with a minimum area of at least 720 square feet. The intent is to provide larger beneficial planting islands or peninsulas, in lieu of many small islands, that can be useful to assist with stormwater management retention and/or infiltration (e.g. rain gardens) and provide for long-term growth of vegetation (e.g. mature tree cover) planted in the island or peninsula, in lieu of many small islands difficult to maintain and do not allow long term growth. 
4.  The interior landscaping shall be placed so as to delineate driving lanes, define rows, protect parking lot light poles and generally mitigate the visual impact of the parking lot. 
5.  The interior landscaping shall be composed of a combination of hardy trees, shrubs, perennials, and groundcover that are able to tolerate winter salt and snow, and are underlain by a layer of decorative mulch and weed barrier where applicable. Where islands are used as retention/infiltration areas for stormwater management, they should be landscaped appropriately for that purpose. Proposed plantings shall be tolerant of flood conditions. 
6.  The interior landscaping shall not exceed 30 inches in height at maturity when located within an identified vision triangle. 
7.  Parking areas may sheet drain into the interior islands, peninsulas, or exterior parking lot landscape areas through cuts in the curb or other apertures. 
c.  Required trees. 
1.
