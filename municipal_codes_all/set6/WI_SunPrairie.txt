1.04.020 - Principles of construction-Definitions. 
    The following rules or meanings shall be applied in the construction and interpretation of ordinances unless such application would be clearly inconsistent with the plain meaning or intent of the ordinances: 
A.  Acts by Agents. When an ordinance requires an act be done by a person which may be legally performed by an authorized agent of that principal person, the requirement shall be construed to include all acts performed by such agents. 
B.  Code and Code of Ordinances. The words "Codes," "Municipal Code" and "Code of Ordinances" when used in any section of this code shall refer to this code of general ordinances of the city of Sun Prairie unless the context of the section clearly indicates otherwise. 
C.  Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these ordinances, the day of the act or event from which the period of time begins to run shall not be included, but the last day of the period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday. If the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven days, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. As used in this section, "legal holiday" means any statewide legal holiday specified by state law and any other city holiday designated by the common council. 
D.  Fine. The term "fine" means the equivalent of the word "forfeiture," and vice versa. 
E.  Gender. Every word in these ordinances referring to the masculine gender shall also be construed to apply to females, and vice versa. 
F.  General Rule. All words and phrases shall be construed according to their plain meaning in common usage. However, words or phrases with a technical or special meaning shall be understood and construed according to that technical or special meaning if such is the intent of the ordinances codified in this code. 
G.  Joint Authority. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or more city officers or employees shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons. 
H.  "Person" means any of the following entities: natural persons, corporations, partnerships, associations, bodies politic or any other entity of any kind which is capable of being sued. 
I.  Repeal. When any ordinance having the effect of repealing a prior ordinance is itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive the prior ordinance or any part thereof, unless expressly so provided.

No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2.92.040(F)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulation so require.

C.  A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2.92.060. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Section 19.37(1), Wisconsin Statutes, or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Prior code § 3-3-5)

C.  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the request record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them; 
2.  Pursuant to Section 19.85(1)(a), Wisconsin Statutes, records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing;

8.  Pursuant to Section 19.85(1)(h), Wisconsin Statutes, requests for confidential written advice from an ethics board, and records of advice given by such ethics board on such requests. 
D.  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the city attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the city attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgement of the custodian and the city attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

Chapter 2.104 - EMPLOYEE WAGE AND SALARY PROGRAM 
Sections: 

2.104.010 - City employee wage and salary program. 
A.  Nonunion Wage Adjustments. The city's nonunion pay plan is a performance-based plan. Under this type of system, employees who perform above an expected level may receive a higher level of compensation while those that perform below expectation will receive less compensation. 
1.  Base (General) Wage Increase. When a base (general) adjustment is made by the council, it is made to all pay ranges in the plan. Employees in the plan, whose performance is rated as adequate or better, normally receive the base (general) pay increase on or around the first of each year. These increases are given to recognize employees for performing their jobs in an acceptable manner and to maintain the competitiveness of the pay plan. 
2.  In-Range Pay Adjustments. These adjustments are given to individual employees and allow them to move within their range. They can take one of the following forms: 
a.  Length of Service Increases. These are given to recognize growth in experience and ability, which a new employee gains through performing the job over time. In most cases, the growth in experience is rapid and pronounced over the first few years and tends to level off after a period of time. An employee will progress in their salary range based upon performance. 
3.  Additional Adjustments; Wage Modification. An employee may receive a reduced wage increase or no wage increase if his or her performance is not acceptable. Poor performance can impact on an employee's base (general) increase, length of service increase, and could actually result in the employee receiving a reduction in his or her current wage rate. 
SUMMARY OF NONUNION PAY INCREASES 
Evaluation Score Below Midpoint Midpoint to Step 9 Step 10 to Maximum 1.49 and below No increase No increase No increase 2.99 to 1.50 Base increase Base increase less wage modification Base increase less wage modification 3.49 to 3.00 Base increase and length of service step Base increase Base increase 3.74 to 3.50 Base increase, length of service step Base increase, length of service step Base increase 5.00 to 3.75 Base increase, length of service step Base increase, length of service step Base increase, length of service step  
A wage adjustment is based on the employee's most recent performance evaluation. 
4.  Administration of the Nonunion Wage and Salary Plan. 
a.  The city administrator shall be responsible for the administration of the wage and salary plan for employees who are not members of a collective bargaining unit. Wage/salary rates for supervisory, professional and confidential employees shall be based on the employee's performance level. 
b.  The employee's department head shall carefully evaluate the employee's job performance each year and submit a report to the city administrator. 
c.  Personnel may be hired above the entrance rate only on approval of the city administrator. Justification for approval shall be limited to recognition of exceptional qualifications of a candidate or the lack of available candidates at the entrance rate. 
B.  Union Wage Adjustments. The annual wages that are paid to all employees who are members of certified collective bargaining units shall be in full accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective collective bargaining agreement approved by the common council. Such approval shall be done by a majority vote of the common council and shall be through an official resolution. 
    The chairpersons of the personnel and finance committees, the city administrator and the finance officer shall serve as the city's official negotiation team. The city negotiation team shall represent the city in all formal and informal negotiations held between the city and the collective bargaining units that have been certified by the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.

The city by resolution of its common council may levy and collect special assessments upon property in a limited and determinable area for special benefits conferred upon such property by any municipal work or improvement and may provide for the payment of all or any part of the cost of the work or improvement. In addition to other methods approved by law, special assessments for any public work or improvement or any special charge for current services may be levied in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The amount assessed against any property for any work or improvement which does not represent an exercise of the police power shall not exceed the value of the benefits accruing to the property therefrom, and for those representing an exercise of the police power, the assessment shall be upon a reasonable basis as determined by the common council. 
C.  The favored procedure in the city for proceeding with making specially assessable public improvements as generally set forth in this chapter is not intended in any way to disregard or to bar proceeding under other methods provided by law for making of public improvements and for the levying of assessments therefor. Detailed requirements still require reference to such statutory section and the subsections thereunder. The purpose hereof is to generally define and establish local procedures. (Prior code § 3-2-1) 
3.16.020 - Procedures. 
A.  The city shall pursue exercising its special assessment powers through the authority granted in Wisconsin Statutes 66.62 or pursuant to other authorizing statutes. 
B.  The city may proceed with the special assessment process at any time before, during, or after the construction of the improvements under local ordinance (by authority granted in Wisconsin Statutes 66.62). In the case of petitioned improvements, and/or when a waiver of special assessment notice and hearing (as provided in Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.60(18)) has been filed with the city for specific improvements, the city may proceed with the letting of bids and contracts for the work at anytime in the process. 
1.  The public works committee shall conduct a public informational meeting with the public affected by the proposed work. The engineer shall prepare a preliminary engineering report describing: 
a.  The scope of the work; 
b.  The estimated project costs; 
c.  Those elements of the work which may be specially assessable; and 
d.  A draft of a preliminary resolution for review, modification by the public works committee. The draft of the reviewed or adopted preliminary resolution shall be forwarded to the city council with a recommendation for council adoption. 
2.  The city council shall determine to assess part or all of the costs of a specific public service or improvement to the benefitting properties under the provisions of Wisconsin Statutes 66.62, by declaring its intent in a preliminary resolution. The preliminary resolution shall describe: 
a.  The contemplated purpose; 
b.  The limits of the area to be assessed; 
c.  The estimated cost of the project; 
d.  The estimated assessment amounts (preliminary assessment roll) if available; 
e.  The date for the public hearing; 
f.  Instructions for the city clerk to publish the preliminary resolution as a Class 1 notice and mail the notice (preliminary resolution) to any affected persons. 
3.  The proposed work shall be let out for bidding. 
4.  The engineer shall view the premises of the public improvement or service and determine that benefits will accrue to the affected parcels. The engineer shall prepare a final report of special assessments with project costs determined from the contract bid prices, a preliminary special assessment roll of the affected properties and the estimated amount of the special assessments for each affected property, and an explanation of how the estimated special assessment amounts had been prepared on a fair and equitable basis in accordance with statutes, ordinances, and the provisions of this policy. 
5.  The public works committee shall hold a public hearing to discuss the recommended special assessments with any interested parties. The public works committee shall review the preliminary resolution and preliminary special assessment roll with those affected property owners in attendance at the public hearing in accordance with the guidelines of this policy, and shall determine and recommend to the city council the following: 
a.  The work or service costs, or portions thereof, to be specially assessed for; 
b.  The rates or percentages of the costs to be borne by the city; 
c.  The rates or percentages of the costs to be borne by the affected property owners; 
d.  The types, interest rate, methods, deferments, and numbers of installments for the special assessments. 
    The public works committee recommendation shall be presented to the city council in the form of the recommended final resolution and assessment roll. 
6.  The city council shall approve and adopt, disapprove, modify, or refer the recommended final resolution and assessment roll back to the public works committee with suggested revisions. 
7.  Upon adoption by the city council, the city clerk shall publish the final resolution as a Class 1 notice and mail copies of the final resolution and assessment roll to the affected property owners. 
8.  The property owner may appeal the special assessment to the circuit court in the manner prescribed in Wisconsin Statutes 66.60(12) within forty (40) days of the date of adoption of the final resolution by the city council. 
9.  If the actual special assessment amounts for each affected property owner are substantially greater than the amounts approved in the assessment roll, the special assessment process may be reopened at Step number 1. If the actual special assessment amounts are less than the amounts approved in the assessment roll, the assessments shall be levied at the actual amount of the assessment. If the actual special assessment amounts are substantially greater than the amounts approved in the assessment roll, or if necessary due to errors in the special assessments or the special assessment process, the city may choose to reopen the assessment process. In addition, the city may choose not to reopen the assessment process (in which case the assessments shall be levied at the amount approved in the assessment roll). 
10.  The special assessments shall be collected in accordance with the final resolution. (Prior code § 3-2-2) 
3.16.030 - Costs that may be paid by special assessment. 
    The cost of any work or improvement to be paid in whole or in part by special assessment on property may include the direct and indirect cost thereof, the damages occasioned thereby, the interest on bonds or notes issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments, a reasonable charge for the services of the administrative staff of the city and the cost of any architectural, engineering and legal services, and any other item of direct or indirect cost which may reasonably be attributed to the proposed work or improvement. The amount to be assessed against all property for any such proposed work or improvement shall be apportioned among the individual parcels in the manner designated by the common council in accordance with the special assessment policies and procedures for the city then in effect. On major projects which benefit the entire community as a whole, a portion of the project cost shall be born by the community as a whole. (Prior code § 3-2-3) 
3.16.040 - Exemptions-Deductions. 
A.  If any property deemed benefited shall by reason of any provision of law be exempt from assessment therefor, such assessment shall be computed and shall be paid by the city. 
B.  A parcel of land against which has been levied a special assessment for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in one of the streets upon which it abuts, shall be entitled to such deduction or exemption as the common council determines in accordance with the special assessment policies and procedures, when a special assessment is levied for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in the other street upon which such corner lot abuts. The common council may allow a similar deduction or exemption from special assessments levied for other public improvements in accordance with the special assessment policies and procedures. 
C.  Intersections. 
1.  For single- and two-family zoning districts, the portion of the street improvements within the limits of the intersection (the right-of-way lines extended), shall be exempt from special assessments and the cost thereof shall be borne by the city. For industrial, commercial, and multi-family (three or more family dwelling units) districts, there shall be no exemptions for street improvements within an intersection since land users in these zoning districts frequently require special features (turning lanes, signalization, etc.) due to the volumes and/or characteristics of the traffic they generate. 
2.  Intersections are sometimes designed with features and fixtures which serve to better accommodate traffic generated from properties which may or may not be immediately contiguous to the intersection. In such instances special assessments may be more fairly and equitably determined through prorations of area, traffic generation or other such methods. In such instances, these methods, or combinations of methods may be utilized so as to result in fair and equitable special assessments. 
3.  The provisions of subsections (C)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to any special assessment levied as a result of a court order in Dane County circuit court Case No. 93-CV-2168. For any such special assessment, the method of payments, billings, installments, deferred payments, interest, penalties, or discounts shall be set by the council in its discretion as part of the final resolution. (Ord. 361 § 1, 1996; prior code § 3-2-4) 
3.16.050 - Notice of proposed or approved project. 
A.  Notice Requirements. On the completion of the preliminary resolution, the city clerk shall publish the preliminary resolution as a Class 1 notice, which notice shall comply with Chapter 985, Wisconsin Statutes, and state the nature of the proposed or approved work or improvement, the general boundary lines of the proposed assessment district, the place and time at which the preliminary assessment roll may be inspected and the place and time at which interested persons, their agents or attorneys may appear before the public works committee and be heard concerning the matters contained in the preliminary resolution and assessment roll. Such notice shall be signed by the city clerk who shall cause the same to be published at least once in the official newspaper and shall mail a copy of such notice at least ten (10) days before the hearing to every interested person whose post office address is known or can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The hearing shall commence not less than ten (10) days and not more than forty (40) days after the publication or mailing of such notice. 
B.  Waiver of Notice-Assessments Under. The council may, without any notice of hearing, levy and assess the whole or any part of the cost of any municipal work or whole or any part of the cost of any municipal work or improvement as a special assessment upon the property specifically benefited thereby whenever notice and hearing thereon is in writing waived by all the owners of property affected by such special assessment. In such cases the procedure shall be the same as herein before provided excepting for the noticing and holding of public hearing thereon. (Prior code § 3-2-5) 
3.16.060 - Council actions after hearing. 
A.  After the hearing, the common council: 
1.  Shall approve, disapprove, modify or re-refer a final resolution and roll of assessments to the public works committee with such directions as it deems necessary to change the final resolution and assessment roll so as to accomplish a fair and equitable assessment; 
2.  If the work or improvement has not been previously authorized or approved, the common council shall approve the work or improvement and direct that the same be done and paid for in accordance with the resolution and assessment roll finally approved; 
3.  If the work or improvement has been commenced or completed prior to the adoption of the resolution and assessment rolls or prior to the hearing, then the common council shall by resolution confirm that the work has been authorized and provide for payment in whole or in part by assessment. 
B.  The clerk shall publish the final resolutions as a Class 1 notice. 
C.  After the publication of the final resolution, any work or improvement provided for and not yet authorized, shall be deemed fully authorized and all awards of compensation or damage and all assessments made shall be deemed duly and properly made, subject to the right of appeal by Section 66.60(12), Wisconsin Statutes, or any other applicable provision of law, in accordance with Section 3-2-10 of this chapter. 
D.  The city clerk shall issue respective special assessment certificates for each property affected and specifying the manner in which payment is to be made and shall send copy of the respective final resolution affecting each property to each owner's post office address that is known or can be obtained with reasonable diligence. (Prior code § 3-2-6) 
3.16.070 - Combined assessments. 
    If more than a single improvement is undertaken, the common council may combine the assessments as a single assessment on each property affected except that the property owner may object to any one or more of such assessment amounts. (Prior code § 3-2-7) 
3.16.080 - Council's power to amend, cancel or confirm special assessment. 
    If after completion or after the receipt of bids, the actual cost of any work or improvement is found to be substantially greater than the original assessment roll amount, or the assessment is void or invalid for any reason, or if the common council determines to reconsider an assessment, it is empowered, after giving notice as required in Section 3.16.050 to amend, cancel or confirm any prior assessment and notice of this amending, canceling or confirming be given by the clerk as provided in Section 3.16.050 of this chapter. (Prior code § 3-2-8) 
3.16.090 - Where cost of improvement is less than assessment. 
    If the cost of the work or improvement is less than the assessment levied, the common council without notice or hearing shall reduce each assessment proportionately. If the assessment has been paid either in part or in full the city shall refund the property owner such overpayment. (Prior code § 3-2-9) 
3.16.100 - Appeals-Appealed assessments payable when due. 
A.  Any person against whose property a special assessment is levied under the ordinance codified in this section may appeal therefrom in the manner prescribed by Section 66.60(12) of the Wisconsin Statutes, as amended, within forty (40) days of the date of the final determination of the common council. 
B.  Pursuant to Section 66.60(12)(f), Wisconsin Statutes, it shall be a condition to the maintenance of any appeal that any assessment appealed shall be paid when due and payable and upon default in payment any such appeal shall be dismissed. (Amended during 2000 codification; prior code § 3-2-10) 
3.16.110 - Payment of special assessments-Special assessment a lien on property. 
A.  Payment of Special Assessment. 
1.  Without Interest. Upon receipt of copy of special assessment certificate, any person may pay the same in full, without interest, if paid to the city treasurer within the grace period therein allowed and as allowed in the final resolution. 
2.  After Grace Period. If such special assessment, or any part thereof, remains unpaid following the running of the grace period specified for payment without interest, at time of preparation of the first tax roll thereafter, the same, together with interest computed thereon at the interest rate established in said final resolution and in such certificates computed from date of levy (i.e., date of final resolution) shall be entered in such tax roll in such manner as directed in such final resolution and certificate; thereafter, if the same be payable in installments, subsequent installments together with interest at said rate computed on declining balance shall be entered in subsequent tax rolls until fully paid. This provision is in no way intended to prohibit the prepayment of the balance owing at any time on principal together with interest to date of payment only. 
B.  Assessment a Lien. Pursuant to Section 66.604 and 66.605, Wisconsin Statutes, any special assessment levied under this chapter shall be a lien on the property against which it is levied on behalf of the city. The common council shall provide for the collection of such assessments and may establish penalties for payment after the due date. The common council shall provide that all assessments not paid by the date specified shall be extended upon the tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property and all proceedings in relation to the collection of such delinquent taxes shall apply to such assessment, except as otherwise provided by statute. 
C.  Financial Hardship Situation. The finance officer/treasurer shall be authorized to pay any assessment legally assessed against the real estate of any worthy person resident in the city provided the individual meets the following criteria: 
1.  Owns and resides in a single-family or two-family residence, against which a special assessment has been levied in accordance with existing ordinance; 
2.  Has an annual federal gross income equal to or less than one hundred seventy-five (175) percent of the United States Community Services Administration's poverty guidelines most recently issued prior to the date the special assessment is levied or prior to the specific special assessment being billed; 
3.  Owns and resides in the single-family or two-family residence on a permanent basis for a period of time not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive months prior to the adoption date of the special assessment resolution; 
4.  Certifies to the city finance officer/treasurer in writing that the full payment of the special assessment, or any installment of the special assessment, would create a financial hardship and that the individual qualifies under subsection (C)(1) and (2) of this section; 
5.  Reconfirms annually to the finance officer/treasurer in writing that the full payment of the special assessment or any installment of the special assessment is a financial hardship and that the individual continues to qualify under subsection (C)(1) and (2) of this section; 
6.  The annual assessment payment would be equal to or greater than seven percent of the individual's federal gross income as identified on the individual's most recent federal tax return; 
7.  In the event that an individual fails to requalify under this program, then their required annual payment would be equal to the annual interest charged for the current year, plus five percent of the outstanding balance but not to exceed seven percent of the individual's federal gross income. The outstanding balance would be proportionately extended upon future tax rolls, under the same financial hardship test; 
8.  In the event that a qualified individual makes a partial payment on their account during the year, the payment allocation of principal and interest shall be governed by the rule of 78's. 
D.  Lien in Financial Hardship Situation. 
1.  A copy of the assessment resolution, including a statement of the amount, date paid and description of the real estate, certified by the city clerk, shall be recorded with the register of deeds of Dane County, and the amount shall thereby become a lien upon such real property in favor of the city prior to any other liens hereunder for the amount paid, with interest at a rate which is one percent above the rate applicable to the city for funds borrowed to make the improvement for which the property was assessed, and shall be enforceable upon transfer of title of the property of sale, inheritance or will, in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of mechanic's liens except when such transfer is to a surviving spouse who meets the above requirements. 
2.  The owner of such property, his or her heirs, personal representative or assigns may discharge the lien at any time by paying the amount of such lien, with accrued interest as computed above, to the finance officer/treasurer who shall execute a proper satisfaction piece which shall be recorded with the register of deeds. 
3.  The holder of any other lien against such real estate may purchase with the written consent of both the property owner and the city such lien of payment of the amount thereof, with accrued interest as computed above, to the city finance officer/treasurer, who shall execute and deliver a proper assignment thereof to such payer and, upon recording the assignment, the assignee shall have the same rights which the city had prior to the assignment. 
4.  The finance officer/treasurer will annually notify the property owners of their outstanding debt plus a breakdown of principal and accrued interest. In addition, an annual report will be submitted to the city administrator reporting on the financial impact of the participants. (Prior code § 3-2-11) 
3.16.120 - Special charges permissible. 
A.  In addition to all other methods provided by law, special charges for current services may be imposed by resolution by the common council by allocating all or part of the cost of the property served. Such resolution setting forth the property location, the current service rendered by the city, and the special charge therefore or cost thereof.

Such notice shall specify that on a certain date a hearing will be held by the common council as to whether the service in question shall be performed. 
B.  Special charges for current services shall not be payable in installments. If not paid within the period fixed by the common council in such resolution, such delinquent special charges, pursuant to Section 3.16.110, shall become a lien on such property as of the date of such delinquency and shall automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, as provided by Section 66.60(16) of the Wisconsin Statutes, and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charge. Notice of special charges for current services need not be given except as required by Section 66.60(16) of the Wisconsin Statutes, as amended. (Prior code § 3-2-12) 
3.16.130 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.  If any assessment or charge levied under this chapter is invalid because such statutes are found to be unconstitutional, the common council may thereafter reassess such assessment or charge pursuant to the provisions of any applicable law. 
B.  The common council may, without notice or hearing, levy and assess all or any part of the cost of any work or improvement upon the property benefited if notice and hearing is waived in writing by property owners affected. 
C.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or this or other ordinance or resolution it is specifically intended and provided by this section that the city may levy special assessments for work or improvement against the property benefited either before or after the approval of the work plans and specifications, contracting for the work or completing the work or improvement. (Prior code § 3-2-13) 
3.16.140 - Payments- Installments- Deferred payments- Interest- Penalties. 
A.  The assessments shall be paid in total in cash or in annual installments as provided by the final assessment resolution. Annual special assessment installment payments shall be due by January 31st of each year. 
B.  Assessments may be deferred by the council if the council determines such deferral is in the best interest of the city. Such deferred assessments shall be deferred for a period of time not to exceed ten (10) years from the date the improvements are installed. If any portion of the improvements are utilized prior to the end of the ten (10) year period, the outstanding principal and interest for the said public improvements shall be paid immediately. 
C.  To encourage prompt payment of assessments, the city will allow property owners a discount of three percent of the total assessment amount for lands located within the city limits if the assessment is paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice by the city. Deferred payments and installment payments on lands within the city limits shall bear interest at the rates set forth below: 
1.  If an amount equal to sixty (60) percent of the full lump sum amount of the assessment is paid within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice by the city, then the unpaid balance to be paid in equal annual installments, together with interest on the unpaid balance at the rate at which the city can borrow for, plus two percent. 
2.  If the assessment is paid in equal annual installments without any up-front lump-sum payment, then the installment shall incur interest on the unpaid balance at the rate at which the city can borrow for, plus three percent. 
3.  If between, forty (40) percent and sixty (60) percent of the full lump sum of the special assessment is paid within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice by the city, then the unpaid balance shall be paid in a lump sum amount at the end of a period equal to the period allowed for annual installment payments, together with interest on the unpaid interest at the rate at which the city can borrow, plus two percent. 
4.  Any special assessments may be paid in an amount equal to the remaining balance due, together with any interest due, at any time. 
D.  All assessments or installments not paid by the specified date shall be extended on the tax roll as a delinquent tax and collected in the same manner as a delinquent real estate tax. Special assessments, or special assessment installments (when allowed by the levying resolution) which are not paid when due shall be charged fifteen (15) percent of the total late payment as a one-time penalty which, together with the late payment, shall be added to the tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property. Installments or assessments not paid when due shall also bear an additional interest charge in an amount of eight percent per annum for the period of delinquency above and beyond the penalty charge established in this section. (Prior code § 3-2-14) 
3.16.150 - Special assessments outside municipal boundaries. 
A.  Wisconsin Statutes 66.65 provides that special assessments may be levied for municipal work or improvements under Wisconsin Statutes 66.60, upon property in an adjacent city, village or town, if such property abuts upon and benefits from such work or improvements. 
B.  Special assessments to property outside of the city limits of the city may be levied under the authority granted in Wisconsin Statutes 66.60 and not under the provisions of the chapter. The common council of the city shall adopt a resolution requesting the governing body of the property outside the city limits to approve a resolution authorizing the levying of special assessments by the city against the property outside the city limits. Upon approval of a final resolution by the adjacent governing body, the special assessments shall be levied and collected by the adjoining governing body and remitted to the city. 
    When the owner of the property outside the municipal boundaries pays the special assessment, he or she is entitled to the use of the work or improvement upon which the assessment is based and with the same conditions as the owner of property within the municipal boundaries. 
C.  Properties outside the corporate limits of the city which are contemplating annexation to the city shall not be specially assessed, except pursuant to Section 66.65, Wisconsin Statutes. However, any property owner contemplating annexation may, at their option choose to pay their cost sharing amounts minus fifteen (15) percent of the total amount set forth in subsection 3.16.140 of this section and further provided that payment is made to the city and the city adopts an ordinance annexing the property all within six months of the date of adoption of the final assessment resolution. 
D.  Properties outside the corporate limits of the city which are not contemplating annexation to the city or whose owners do not elect the option provided in subsection C of this section shall not be specially assessed unless the governing body of these properties approves the special assessment and levies, collects and remits the special assessment payments to the city. Such special assessment shall be levied under the authority granted in Section 66.65, Wisconsin Statutes. However, the city reserves the right to calculate the prorated costs of the improvements resulting in benefit to the properties located outside the city limits as a cost sharing amount (together with any interest due, to be considered at the time of annexation of the properties to the city). The city reserves the right to determine at the time of annexation what cost sharing amounts should reasonably be paid by the property owner and under what payment terms and conditions. (Prior code § 3-2-15) 
3.16.160 - Petition for improvements-Waiver of assessment procedures.

The council may refer such petition to its standing committees for determinations of project costs, project financing, feasibility and timing of construction, and other matters, or may table it, modify it through negotiation with the petitioner, or may reject it, but shall act on such petition in some manner within six months of receipt of such petition. 
3.  Timing of Petition. Any petition for improvements shall be filed with the city council on or before August 1st of the year preceding the desired installation of the public improvement so as to be considered in the city budget for the following year and so as to permit the necessary engineering of the requested public improvements. Petitions may be filed with the city council at other times of the year, and with other desired installation times. The city council and/or its standing committee shall review these petitions, without commitment or obligation, for consideration of the project costs, project financing, feasibility and timing of construction, and other such matters, and may elect to authorize the installation of the requested public improvements as a special project or as an addition to a previously authorized project.

If the licensee is assessed additional demerit points following the issuance of the formal letter of suspension or revocation within the same twelve-month period, all of the licensee's alcohol beverages licenses for such premises shall be suspended or revoked. If a licensee is assessed two hundred (200) or more points for one or more point violations which occurred at any one premises within any twelve-month period, all of the licensee's alcohol beverages licenses for such premises shall be suspended or revoked.

5.08.170 - Social hosting. 
A.  Purpose and Findings. The city of Sun Prairie intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons civilly responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under twenty-one (21) years of age possess or consume alcohol or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city of Sun Prairie finds: 
1.  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
2.  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
3.  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic efforts on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
4.  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity, and in some circumstances, provide the alcohol. 
5.  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
B.  The provisions of Section 125.07(1)(a)(3), Wisconsin Statutes are hereby adopted by reference. The penalty or violation of the statute adopted by this section shall be as provided in Section 125.07(b), Wisconsin Statutes, except that there shall be no imprisonment. 
1.  Should any portion of this section be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected. 
2.  This section shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and publication.

The applicant shall pay to grantee in advance per foot for the total length of boring or pavement cutting required when cables must be installed under existing driveways, parking lots, etc. Costs per foot of such boring or pavement cutting shall not exceed the direct cost to grantee of such work. 
3.  Right-of-Ways, Easements and Maintenance of Grade. Right-of-ways and easements suitable to grantee must be furnished by either the applicant or developer without cost to grantee in reasonable time to meet service requirements. The right-of-way should be cleared of trees, tree stumps and other obstructions prior to installation of cable TV facilities, but thereafter may be used by the grantor in such ways as not to interfere with grantee's ability to maintain its cable TV facilities at any time. The right-of-way shall be graded within six inches of final grade and such grading maintained by the applicant during construction. Future changes or relocations of grantee's facilities required because of changes in grade shall be at the expense of the property owner.

Chapter 5.68 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
Sections: 

5.68.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  It is the intent of this article to regulate sexually oriented adult entertainment establishment businesses, referred to in this article as "adult oriented establishments"; to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city; to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city; to aid in the alleviation and prevention of the adverse and deleterious effects of criminal activity and disruption of the public peace associated with such establishments; to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the serious health hazards associated with unsafe and unsanitary conditions known to exist in such establishments; and to alleviate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other contagious diseases in such establishments. 
B.  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the city presented in hearings and in reports made available to the common council and findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Dallas, Texas (1997); Houston, Texas (1997); Garden Grove, Oklahoma (1991); and Beaumont, Texas (1982); and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the common council finds: 
1.  Sexually oriented establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. There is presently no mechanism to make the owners of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Certain employees of sexually oriented establishments such as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented establishments, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows. 
4.  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such establishments. 
6.  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella and shigella infections. 
7.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of such facilities to self-regulate such activities and maintain such facilities. 
8.  The findings noted in subsections B.1.-7. of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
9.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of such reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators of such establishments to ensure that the sexually oriented establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented establishment, and is fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring in such establishment. 
10.  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
11.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented establishment, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
12.  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
13.  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in such conduct in contravention of this article. 
14.  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

The practice of providing equal opportunity in employment and public accommodations to person(s) without regard to actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex/gender, disability, arrest/conviction record, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression, political affiliation, results of genetic testing, honesty testing, pregnancy or childbirth, military service, disabled veteran or covered veteran status, service in the U.S. Armed Force, the State Defense force, National Guard of any state, or any reserve component of the United States or State Military Forces, or an individual's affiliation with or perceived affiliation with any of these protected categories, is a desirable goal of the city of Sun Prairie and a matter of legitimate concern to its government.

C.  Provision for adequate safeguards against discrimination is a proper and necessary function of city government. To protect the health, safety and general welfare of all inhabitants of the city, and all persons employed or living within the city, it is declared to be the public policy of this city to foster and enforce to the fullest extent of the law equal opportunity employment and public accommodations without regard to actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex/gender, disability, arrest/conviction record, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression, political affiliation, results of genetic testing, honesty testing, pregnancy or childbirth, military service, disabled veteran or covered veteran status, service in the U.S. Armed Force, the State Defense force, National Guard of any state, or any reserve component of the United States or State Military Forces, or an individual's affiliation with or perceived affiliation with any of these protected categories. To fully effectuate this policy of promoting nondiscrimination, the city shall endeavor to eliminate all discrimination that may occur within employment and accommodation within the city of Sun Prairie. 
D.  Where applicable, this chapter shall be interpreted and applied consistently with the provisions of Title II, Title III and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. sections 3601 et seq., 24 C.F.R. sections 100 et seq., and ss. 66.1011, 106.50 and 111.31, Wis.

After a second violation within a six-month period, if the defendant, in a prosecution under this section, proves that he or she is unable to comply with this ordinance because of the disobedience of the child, the action shall be dismissed and the child shall be referred to the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under Chapter 48, Wisconsin Statutes. 
2.  Any minor person under seventeen (17) years of age, who shall violate this section shall upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than one dollar ($1.00), nor more than twenty-five dollars ($25.00), together with the cost of prosecution. (Ord. 433 § 1, 1998: prior code § 11-6-1)

Chapter 9.34 - SEXUAL OFFENDER RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS 
Sections: 

9.34.010 - Sexual offender residency restrictions. 
A.  Recitals. 
1.  Whereas, after review of existing case law and sex offender restriction ordinances from other cities and maps of locations where children are known to congregate, the city adopted sex offender residency restrictions by ordinance on October 7, 2008. 
2.  Whereas, upon recent review of an order and published opinion in the case of Hoffman, et al. v. Village of Pleasant Prairie, Case No. 16-CF-697-JES from the United States District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin, the city recommended review of the ordinance codified in this section in light of this most recent court decision and determined that additional revisions should be made to the ordinance. 
3.  Whereas, on December 19, 2017, the Sun Prairie Committee of the Whole held a meeting open to the public and reviewed and discussed the ordinance as well as the following written materials: 
i.  "Recidivism of Adult Sexual Offenders." U.S. Department of Justice, July 2015, SOMAPI (Sex Offender Management Assessment and Planning Initiative); and 
ii.  "An Overview of Sex Offender Management." July 2002, U.S. Department of Justice, SCOM Center for Sex Offender Management; and 
iii.  "There Goes the Neighborhood? Estimate of the Impact of Crime Risk on Property Values from Megan's Laws." May 2006, National Bureau of Economic Research; and 
iv.  Order and Opinion of the Honorable J.P. Stadtmueller of the United States District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin, Hoffman, et al. v. Village of Pleasant Prairie, Case No. 16-CF-697-JPS. 
v.  Official map showing prohibited locations as defined by this chapter. 
B.  Findings and intent. 
1.  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
2.  It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from loitering or establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
3.  This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the city from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. The city finds and declares that repeat sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children, are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety and the health of children. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large and the community where they reside, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. It is further believed that such persons present an alarmingly high risk of re-offending once released. As such, the city hereby establishes regulations which restrict certain offenders from residing or congregating in areas that are at or near where there is a high concentration of children in order to provide better protection for children in the city by minimizing immediate access and proximity to children and thereby reducing opportunity and temptation for recidivism. 
4.  It is not the intent of the city council to punish sex offenders, but rather to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, wherein, certain sexual offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. Due to the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders, and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of re-offense, there is a compelling need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places.

(Ord. 534, § 1, 2000; prior code § 10-1-50) 
10.08.080 - Railroad regulations.

Any person violating this section shall be subject to a forfeiture as provided in Section 10.24.010 of this code. 
(Prior code § 10-1-51) 
10.08.090 - Pedestrian regulations. 
A.  Pedestrian Obedience to Traffic Control Devices and Regulations. 
1.  Obedience to Traffic Control Devices. No persons shall fail to obey the instructions of any Uniform Traffic Control Device when traveling as a pedestrian on any highway within the city unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement officer. 
2.  Crossing at Crosswalks. No pedestrian shall cross at a crosswalk except on the right half thereof whenever practicable. Where sidewalks are provided, no pedestrian shall walk along and upon an adjacent roadway except when the sidewalk is visibly unsafe, obstructed, or closed to public travel. 
B.  Prohibited Pedestrian Crossings. No pedestrian shall cross between adjacent intersections, unless such crossing is permitted by official traffic control devices. 
C.  Entering or staying upon highways restricted. 
1.  Purpose. Pedestrians are increasingly using highways in ways for which the roads were not designed. These uses include approaching vehicles when in use or staying upon medians for purposes other than crossing the highway. These activities create safety hazards for pedestrians and distract drivers, making automobile crashes more likely. This ordinance is designed to decrease the safety hazards by restricting such activity. These safety concerns are most acute on the busiest streets in the city of Sun Prairie, identified as arterial streets or highways, and some streets intersecting with those arterial streets. This ordinance applies to those "covered highways" identified in subsection C.7 herein. 
2.  Definitions. As used in this ordinance, 
    "Arterial Street" is defined as a street which provides for the movement of relatively heavy volumes of traffic to, from, or within the city. It has a secondary function of providing access to collector and minor streets and tertiary function of providing access to abutting properties. 
    "Covered Highway" is defined in subsection C.7 herein. 
    A vehicle is "in operation" when it has an operator, as defined in Wisconsin Statutes § 340.01(41). 
    A "median" is a paved or unpaved area dividing a street or highway that separates lanes of traffic traveling in opposite directions, or in the case of left or right hand turn lanes, vehicles traveling in the same direction. 
3.  No person, other than a person in or on a vehicle, shall be on a covered highway listed in subsection C.7 and approach any vehicle in operation, except a vehicle that is legally parked at the curb or the shoulder. 
4.  No person shall be upon a median of a covered highway listed in subsection C.7 unless that person is in the process of crossing the highway in a safety zone or crosswalk. It is a prima facie evidence of a violation of this section if a person stays on the median through two consecutive opportunities to cross the highway in a legal manner under this Chapter and the state traffic laws adopted herein. This may include a change in the traffic control signal or lack of traffic, as applicable. After such two consecutive opportunities, such person shall not be considered to be "using the safety zone or crosswalk to cross the highway" for purposes of the exception in subsection C.6.b. 
5.  No operator of a vehicle shall park, stop or leave standing a vehicle on a covered highway listed in subsection C.7 where prohibited or suddenly decrease the speed of said vehicle or deviate from a traffic lane for the purpose of responding to persons violating subsections C.3 or C.4. 
6.  Exceptions.

(Ord. 518, § 1 (part), 2000; prior code § 6-2-5(l)) 
12.16.130 - Mailboxes. 
A.  Purpose. Since it is in the public interest to promote effective and efficient postal service the city does not discourage the practice of allowing its citizens to locate a mailbox within the city-owned street portion of the public right-of-way in front of private residences by constructing and retaining mail receptacles without obtaining permits. Such placement does occasionally result in the inadvertent damage to such privately owned property by city crews in undertaking snow removal or other public services. The city acknowledges that the mailboxes are placed in city right-of-way without express permit and the city may take the position that any damage to such mail receptacle is not the responsibility of the city. However, the city believes that notions of fairness and equity compel the city to accept reasonable responsibility for damages caused by city crews in providing services. The city therefore sets reasonable limits to its responsibilities in regard to damage to mail receptacles placed in city right-of-way. 
B.  Placement. Commencing December 1, 2010, the placement and replacement of mailboxes within the street right-of-way shall meet the following city criteria: 
1.  The distance from the road surface to the bottom of the letter acceptance portion of the mailbox shall be between forty-one (41) to forty-five (45) inches. 
2.  The distance from the face of the curb or road edge to the closest portion of the mailbox to the street shall be six to eight inches. 
C.  Specifications. Mailboxes shall conform to the following specifications: 
1.  The mailbox must be of metal construction mounted on a four-by-four treated post or two-inch steel, aluminum pipe or square tubing or a fully plastic molded combination mailbox and post. Concrete or brick and mortar supports are not allowed. Mailboxes may deviate from this specification however if damaged as described below the owner must make the repairs or replacement and the city will reimburse with proof of receipts the owner up to a cost of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (see subsection D.3). 
2.  a.  Mailboxes constructed with concrete or brick and mortar supports prior to March 23, 2006, may remain in place but if damaged as described below, the owner must make the repairs or replacement and the city will reimburse with proof of receipts the owner up to a cost of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (see subsection D.3). 
b.  Mailboxes constructed with concrete or brick and mortar supports prior to March 23, 2006, may only be replaced in compliance with this section. 
D.  Damaged Mailboxes. As damage occurs to private property mailboxes, the city of Sun Prairie will take the following actions: 
1.  The city of Sun Prairie public works department shall not be responsible and assume no responsibility for repairing or replacing any damaged mailboxes when: 
a.  The mailbox is not located properly within the city right-of-way and/or as postal service specified regardless of the circumstances causing the damage. 
b.  The mailbox is damaged as a result of objects, snow, sleet, ice, water, or other precipitation thrown by a plow. 
c.  The mailbox is found to have been in unsound condition prior to the damage, regardless of the circumstances causing the damage. 
d.  The mailbox is damaged by any person who is not acting under the direction or at the request of the city of Sun Prairie. 
2.  Except as provided in paragragh (1), above, the city of Sun Prairie public works department shall be responsible for replacing or repairing damaged mailboxes when: 
a.  The mailbox is physically struck by a city of Sun Prairie-owned and operated maintenance vehicle. 
b.  The mailbox is physically struck by a city of Sun Prairie-operated snowplow. 
c.  The mailbox is physically struck by a snowplow owned and operated by a subcontractor performing precipitation removal operations at the request of the city of Sun Prairie. 
3.  Damaged mailboxes that are replaced by the city of Sun Prairie pursuant to this section shall be new but not necessarily identical to the damaged mailbox. The replacement cost for the mailbox where repairs are conducted by the city shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the mailbox, post and materials, or reimbursement to property owner with proper receipt for such a replacement shall also not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
E.  If the department accepts responsibility to repair the mailbox, the public works department will temporarily repair or provide for a temporary mailbox within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of notice and acknowledgement that the city is responsible for the damage. 
F.  Permanent mailbox repairs will be made in the spring when the frost has left the ground. 
G.  Mailbox damage must be reported by May 1st of each year to qualify for repair. Receipts must be turned in to the public works department by July 1st of each year to qualify for reimbursement.

Chapter 12.28 - UTILITY INSTALLATIONS IN PUBLIC PLACES 
Sections: 

12.28.010 - Occupancy of rights-of-way. 
(1)  General Provisions. 
(A)  Purpose and Findings. In the exercise of its police powers, the city has priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city desires to anticipate and minimize the number of obstructions and excavations taking place in the public rights-of-way to ensure that the rights-of-way remain available for public services and safe for public use, and to ensure that facilities are timely maintained, supported, protected or relocated to accommodate reconstruction or repairs. The taxpayers of the city bear the financial burden for the upkeep, maintenance and reconstruction of the rights-of-way and a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of the public rights-of-way is the frequent excavation by persons who place facilities therein. 
    The city finds that there has been an increase in the use of the public rights-of-way and, as a result, increased costs to the taxpayers of the city and that these costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future. 
    The city finds that delays by occupants of the rights-of-way in maintaining, supporting, protecting or relocating facilities, if they impact public construction projects, have the potential to significantly increase public works project costs borne by the taxpayers. Moreover, the city finds that some right-of-way occupants have a history of delays and nonresponsiveness. 
    The city finds that occupancy and excavation of its rights-of-way causes direct and indirect costs to be borne by the city and its taxpayers, including but not limited to: 
1.  Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials; 
2.  Management costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public right-of-way users; 
3.  Repair or restoration costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into the public right-of-way; and, 
    In response to the foregoing facts, and pursuant to its authority under Wis. Stat. §§ 62.11(5), 86.16, 182.017, and 196.58, the city hereby enacts this section relating to the administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way. This section imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide the city a legal framework within which to regulate and manage the public rights-of-way, and to provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the city in doing so. This section provides for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city as they use the rights-of-way of the city, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way. 
    Under this section, all persons who excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way will reimburse the city's administrative, inspection, ongoing management costs.

The permittee shall perform repairs according to the standard specifications for public works construction, the plans and specifications of the department, and in accordance with the conditions specified in the permit. The department shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the repair and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. 
(D)  Acceptance of Work. Upon completion of the work, the department shall inspect the area of the work and accept the work when it determines that proper repair has been made. 
(E)  Guarantees. The permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for thirty-six (36) months following its completion. During either period, the permittee shall, upon notification from the department, correct all repair work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the department.

The city may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.

A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.

1.  The dispute has been adjudicated in favor of the applicant; or, 
2.  The dispute is the subject of an appeal filed by the applicant and no decision in the matter has at yet been rendered. 
(C)  Discretionary Issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (A), the department may issue a permit where issuance is necessary to prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permittee or applicant, or to allow such customer to materially improve its utility service, or to allow the permittee or applicant to comply with federal, state, county or city laws or ordinances or an order of a court or administrative agency. 
(D)  Appeals.

The city may take whatever action it deems necessary to protect the public safety as a result of the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the applicant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. 
(B)  Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, excavates a right-of-way must subsequently register and apply for a utility installation permit, and shall in addition to any penalties prescribed by ordinance, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this section or other sections of the Sun Prairie Municipal Code of Ordinances, deposit with the department the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this section.

(C)  Non-Compliant Work. All work that is determined by the city to be non-compliant with city standards and/or approved project plans must be removed or corrected immediately. 
(14)  Location of Facilities.

To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the department may prohibit or limit the placement of new, replacement or additional facilities within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the department shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. 
(C)  Attachment to Bridges.

The owner of such pipes, conduits, cables or wires shall be entitled to no compensation for removal or relocation of the same in the case of repair, removal, or replacement of said bridge structure by the city. 
(D)  Corridors. The department may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue consistent with the department's assignment. 
    Any permittee who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city under this subdivision shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the permittee.

(F)  Penalty. If a permittee fails to perform the required action by the due date, the permittee shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first offense within a three year period, and a forfeiture of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for the second or subsequent offense within a three year period.

(18)  Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The city, by the granting of a permit to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way, or by registering a person under this section, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights which it has, or may be hereafter granted, under the constitution and statutes of the state of Wisconsin to regulate the use of the right-of-way; and the permittee, by its acceptance of a permit to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way, and the permittee agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise, as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A permittee is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general law, and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such powers.

12.40.050 - Abatement of tree nuisances. 
A.  Dutch Elm and Other Tree Diseases a Public Nuisance. Whereas the common council has determined that there are many trees growing on public and private premises within the city, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the city, and that the health and life of such trees is threatened by fatal diseases such as Dutch Elm disease or Oak Wilt. The council declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of such diseases and the insect pests and vectors which carry such diseases. 
B.  Inspection. 
1.  The property owner abutting the terrace area in which a tree is located shall inspect or cause to inspect all trees, thereupon, to determine whether any public nuisance exists. The property owner shall also inspect all trees located on his or her private property boundary to also insure no public nuisance exists. Public nuisance is defined in Section 12.40.020. 
2.  The city forester shall inspect or cause to inspect all premises and places defined as a public area to determine whether any public nuisance exists therein. He or she shall also inspect or cause to inspect trees on terrace areas or private property when a complaint has been registered. 
3.  The forester shall authorize inspections when necessary to determine the existence of tree disease or harboring insects in any tree. The person inspecting such tree shall remove or cut specimens from the tree in such manner as to avoid fatal injury thereto and deliver such specimens to the forester who shall forward them to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture in Madison for analysis to determine the presence of such nuisances. 
4.  The forester and his or her agents or employees shall have authority to enter upon private premises for the purpose of carrying out any of the provisions of this section. 
C.  Abatement of Other Tree Nuisances-Duty of Forester. 
1.  When a tree on private property becomes a nuisance by an act of God or due to a weakened condition and poses an immediate hazardous or dangerous condition to persons and property using or upon any street, sidewalk, alley, park or other public place, the forester shall order the immediate removal of such a tree hazard to allow for a safe condition. The cost of removal of such tree to a safe condition from public property shall be charged to the property owner. The tree will only be removed enough to provide for safety whereupon the property owner will be responsible for the completion of the full removal. 
2.  The forester shall order, direct, supervise and control the abatement of public nuisances as defined in this section by spraying, injecting, removal, burning or by other means which he or she determines to be necessary to prevent as fully as possible the spread of Dutch Elm disease fungus, other deleterious tree diseases or the insect pests or vectors known to carry such diseases. 
3.  Whenever the forester after inspection or examination shall determine that a public nuisance as herein defined exists on public property in the city, he or she shall immediately abate or cause the abatement of such public nuisance in such manner as to destroy or prevent as fully as possible the spread of deleterious tree diseases, or the insect pests or vectors known to carry such disease. 
4.  a.  When the forester shall determine with reasonable certainty that a private or public nuisance exists upon private premises, he or she shall immediately serve or cause to be served personally or by registered mail upon the owner of such property, if he or she can be found, or upon the occupant thereof, a written notice of the existence of such nuisance. The notice shall have a time and place for a hearing, not less than fourteen (14) days after service of such notice, on the abatement action to be taken. Such notice shall describe the nuisance and recommend procedures of its abatement and shall further state that the owner shall abate the nuisance in the manner specified in the notice, or shall appear at a hearing before the city council to show that such nuisance does not exist or does not endanger the health of trees in the city. If the owner cannot be found, such notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
b.  If after conducting a hearing held pursuant to this subsection it shall be determined by the common council that a public nuisance exists, it shall forthwith order the immediate abatement thereof. Unless the property owner abates the nuisance as directed within five days after such hearing, the forester shall proceed to abate the nuisance and cause the cost thereof to be charged against the property in accordance with the procedures provided in this section. The forester may extend the time allowed the property owner for abatement work but not to exceed ten (10) additional days. 
D.  Spraying. 
1.  Whenever the forester shall determine that any tree or part thereof is infected with a deleterious or fatal tree disease or is in a weakened condition, he/she may cause all trees within a one thousand (1,000) foot radius thereto be sprayed or injected with an effective disease destroying concentrate or other insecticide. 
2.  In order to facilitate the work and minimize the inconvenience to the public of any spraying operations conducted under this section, the forester shall cause to be given advance public notice of such operations by the city's official newspaper or other effective means and shall also cause the posting of appropriate warning notices in the areas and along the streets where trees are to be sprayed at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of spraying. When any residue or concentrate from municipal spraying operations can be expected to be deposited on any public street, the forester shall also notify the chief of police, who shall take all necessary steps to make and enforce temporary parking and traffic regulations on such streets as conditions require. Temporary "no parking" notices shall be posted in each block of any affected street at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of spraying operations. 
3.  When appropriate warning notices and temporary "no parking" notices have been given and posted in accordance with subsection B., of this section, the city shall not allow any claim for damages to any vehicle caused by such spraying operations. 
4.  When trees on private property are to be sprayed, the forester shall notify the owner of such property and proceed in accordance with the requirements of subsection D.2., of this section.

A.  On October 15th of each year, notice shall be given the owner or occupant of all lots or parcels of real estate within the city to which water, sewer or electric service has been furnished prior to October 1st, by the city of Sun Prairie utilities and payment for which is owing and in arrears at the time of giving such notice. The city of Sun Prairie utilities shall furnish the city treasurer with a list of all such lots or parcels of real estate, and a notice shall be given by the city treasurer. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state the amount of such arrears, including any penalty assessed pursuant to the rules of the city of Sun Prairie utilities; that unless the same is paid by November 1st, thereafter a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of such arrears will be added thereto; unless such arrears, with any such added penalty, shall be paid by November 15th thereafter, the same will be levied as a tax against the lot or parcel of real estate to which water, sewer or electric service was furnished and for which payment is delinquent. Such notice may be served by delivery to either such owner or occupant personally, or by letter addressed to such owner or occupant at the post office of such lot or parcel of real estate. 
B.  On November 16th of each year, the water and light commission shall certify and file with the city clerk a list of all lots or parcels of real estate, giving the legal description thereof, to the owners or occupants of which notice of arrears and payment were given as above specified and which arrears still remain unpaid, and stating the amount of such arrears together with the added penalty thereon as herein provided. Each delinquent amount, including such penalty shall thereupon become a lien upon the lot or parcel of real estate to which water or electric service was furnished and payment for which is delinquent, and the clerk shall insert the same as a tax against such lot or parcel of real estate. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent taxes shall apply to such tax if the same is not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes upon real estate. 
C.  The owner or occupant may within ten (10) days of the date such notice is sent, request a hearing in any charge disputed.

Any person who desires to use water from a city source prior to the time when the service lateral has been installed, or the meter is in operation on any premises, such person may acquire a permit from the superintendent whereby such person may be permitted to use water from a city hydrant and pay therefor a reasonable charge. The charge shall be assessed prior to the granting of the permit in each individual case and the amount of such charge shall be stated on the face of the permit. The superintendent, at his or her discretion may authorize a permit to a person whereby a water main may be tapped to provide water for building purposes. In this event the superintendent or his or her employees shall tap the main and attach thereto a temporary service pipe for the property in question, and the charge therefor shall be assessed to the person to whom the permit is granted and the charges shall be paid at the time that the permit is granted.

(Prior code § 9-2-26) 
13.08.110 - Refunds of monetary deposits. 
    All moneys deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a sprinkling valve wheel or reducer, if the water is used on an unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor, and the return of the wheel and reducer. 
(Prior code § 9-2-27) 
13.08.120 - Service connections (or water laterals). 
A.  Protection of Service Pipes. No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the superintendent. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to moisture. 
B.  Backfilling. In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling, free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material, around and at least six inches over the pipe. 
C.  Lateral Sizing. All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously. All such service shall comply with the provisions of the state plumbing code and shall be inspected by the building inspector. 
D.  Tapping the Mains. 
1.  The superintendent or an employee of the utility under the supervision of the superintendent shall be the only persons authorized or permitted to tap the water mains in the city and to install the water service laterals from the city water mains to a point between the outside line of the platted or dedicated street and the inside line of the curb or gutter, at which point a curb stop shall be set and enclosed in a standard service box. The curb stop and service box shall be of the pattern which the city has heretofore adopted as standard. 
2.  The charge for tapping the mains that be pursuant to the public service commission rules and regulations in effect. 
3.  The superintendent of the utility shall cause a statement of all charges to be made as specified in subsection (D)(2) of this section to be sent to the owner or owners of the lands so benefited by the tapping of the water mains and the installation of the tapping of the water mains and the installation of the water laterals and the superintendent shall use reasonable diligence to proceed for prompt collection of the same. 
E.  Delinquent Accounts. In the event that any of the charges assessed by the commission for the installation of water laterals are not paid prior to the first day of November of the year of installation such charges shall be set forth by the superintendent in the form of a list and shall be submitted to the city treasurer to be entered on the tax roll and shall become a lien on the premises for which the services were installed, and thereupon such lien shall be collected in the same manner as any special assessment. 
F.  Connection to Services. No connection shall be made to the water service lateral other than at the outlet provided in the curb stop. No person shall make any connection to a curb stop on a water lateral except for the purpose of bringing water through meter placed or situated on the premises where the water is to be consumed or used. The meter shall be supplied by the commission at no expense to the property owner, but the property owner shall provide a place to install such meter inside the structure situated on the premises, such place to be so situated as to protect the water meter from any climatic damage, any other damage and approved by the superintendent. 
G.  Connection to Discontinued Laterals. No person shall make any connection to any old lateral or curb stop from which water has been shut off and the supply discontinued unless the person requesting such connection to the old or discontinued water lateral makes an application and obtains a reissuance of a permit to connect to the old or discontinued water lateral following the same procedure as outlined above. 
H.  Service Pipe and Equipment. All service pipe extending from the main pipe to the curb stop shall be one inch copper pipe or larger and the pipe from the curb stop to the building into which the installation is being made shall also be one inch copper of the same size as the pipe from the main to the curb stop. 
I.  Size of Taps. A four inch main shall receive no larger a tap than one inch. A six inch main shall use a standard three-fourths inch tap, except that a larger tap may be made by the superintendent if, in his opinion a larger tap is necessary, and such larger tap will in no way effect a proper distribution of water in any part of the community. All taps shall be at least one foot apart, and no main shall be tapped nearer than six inches to any joint. Taps shall be made in front of the property to be serviced, and no service pipe shall cross a lot line from one lot to another. (Prior code § 9-2-28) 
13.08.130 - Service piping for meter settings. 
A.  In cases where a new customer whose service is to be metered installs the original service piping or where an existing metered customer changes his or her service piping for his or her own convenience, or where an existing flat rate customer requests to be metered, the customer shall, at his or her expense, provide a suitable location and the proper connections for the meter. The water superintendent should be consulted as to the type and size of the meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the superintendent (he or she may require a horizontal run of eighteen (18) inches in such pipe line) which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. 
B.  No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service. (Prior code § 9-2-29) 
13.08.140 - Turning on water. 
    The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of the utility. When a plumber has completed a job, he or she must leave the water turned off. This does not prevent him or her from testing his or her work. (Prior code § 9-2-30) 
13.08.150 - Failure to read meters. 
A.  Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding month will be computed with the cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. 
B.  If the meter is damaged (see Section 13.08.260, surreptitious use of water) or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. (Prior code § 9-2-31)

(Prior code § 9-2-39) 
13.08.240 - Customer's deposits. 
A.  New Residential Service. The utility may require a cash deposit or other guarantee as a condition of new residential service if, and only if, the customer has an outstanding account balance with the utility which accrued within the last six years, and which at the time of the request for new service remains outstanding and not in dispute.

F.  Other Conditions. A new or additional deposit may be required upon reasonable written notice of the need therefor if such new or additional deposit could have been required under the circumstances when the initial deposit was made. Service may be refused or disconnected for failure to pay a deposit request as provided in the rules. When service has been disconnected for failure to make a deposit, or for failure to pay a delinquent bill, or for failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement, and satisfactory arrangements have been made to have service restored, a reconnection charge as specified elsewhere in these rules, shall be paid by the customer as a condition to restoration of service. 
G.  Guarantee Contracts. 
1.  The utility may accept, in lieu of a cash deposit, a contract signed by a guarantor satisfactory to the company, whereby payment of a specified sum not exceeding the cash deposit requirement is guaranteed. The term of a guarantee contract shall be two years, but shall automatically terminate after the customer has closed his or her account, or at the guarantor's request upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the utility. 
2.  Upon termination of a guarantee contract or whenever the company deems same insufficient as to amount or surety, a cash deposit or a new or additional guarantee may be required upon reasonable written notice to the customer. Service to any customer who fails to comply with these requirements may be refused, or upon eight days' written notice, disconnected. 
3.  The utility shall mail the guarantor copies of all disconnect notices sent to the customer whose account he or her has guaranteed unless the guarantor waives such notice in writing.

(Prior code § 9-2-40) 
13.08.250 - Disconnection and refusal of service. 
A.  Reasons for Disconnection. Service may be disconnected or refused for any of the following reasons: 
1.  Failure to pay a delinquent account or failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement;

3.  Failure to comply with deposit or guarantee arrangements as provided for in these rules and regulations; 
4.  Diversion of service around the meter. 
B.  Disconnection for Delinquent Accounts. 
1.  A bill for service is delinquent if unpaid after the due date shown on the bill. The utility may disconnect service for a delinquent bill by giving the customer, at least eight calendar days prior to disconnection, a written disconnect notice which may be included with the bill for service. For purposes of this rule, the due date shall not be less than twenty (20) days after issuance. 
2.  The utility may disconnect without notice where a dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any customer for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and regulations of the public service commission or of these rules and regulations, or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the customer's premises. 
3.  The utility shall notify the Dane County department of health and social services at least five calendar days prior to any scheduled disconnection of residential service if the customer or responsible person has made a written request for this procedure. The utility shall apprise customers of this right upon application for service. If service to a residential customer which has been disconnected has not been restored within twenty-four (24) hours after disconnection, the utility shall notify the Sun Prairie police department of the billing name and service address and that a threat to health and life might exist to persons occupying the premises. 
C.  Deferred Payment Agreement. 
1.  The utility shall offer deferred payment agreements to residential customers. The deferred payment agreement shall provide that service will not be discontinued for the outstanding bill if the customer pays a stated reasonable amount of the outstanding bill and agrees to pay a stated reasonable portion of the remaining outstanding balance in installments until the bill is paid. In determining what amounts are "reasonable," the parties shall consider the: 
a.  Size of the delinquent account; 
b.  Customer's ability to pay; 
c.  Customer's payment history; 
d.  Time that the debt has been outstanding; 
e.  Reasons why the debt has been outstanding; 
f.  Any other relevant factors concerning the circumstances of the customer. 
2.  In the deferred payment agreement it shall state immediately preceding the space provided for the customer's signature and in bold-faced print at least two sizes larger than any other used thereon, the following: 
 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT SIGN. IF YOU DO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE AMOUNT DUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT EXCEPT FOR THE UTILITY's FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
3.  A deferred payment agreement shall not include a finance charge. 
4.  If an applicant for service has not fulfilled the terms of a deferred payment agreement, the utility shall have the right to disconnect service or refuse service in accordance with these rules and under such circumstances, it shall not be required to offer subsequent negotiation of a deferred payment agreement prior to disconnection. 
5.  Any payments made by the customer in compliance with a deferred payment agreement, or otherwise, shall be first considered made in payment of the previous account balance with any remainder credited to the current bill. 
D.  Dispute Procedures. 
1.  Whenever the customer advises the utility's designated office prior to the disconnection of service that all or part of any billing as rendered is in dispute, or that any matter related to the disconnection is in dispute, the company shall investigate the dispute promptly and completely, advise the customer of the results of the investigation, attempt to resolve the dispute, and provide the opportunity for the customer to enter into a deferred payment agreement when applicable in order to settle the dispute. 
2.  After the customer has pursued the available remedies with the utility, he or she may request that the public service commission's staff informally review the disputed issue and recommend terms of settlement. 
3.  Any party to the dispute after informal review may make a written request for a formal review by the commission. If the commission decides to conduct a formal hearing on the dispute, the customer must pay fifty (50) percent of the bill in dispute or post a bond for that amount on or before the hearing date. Failure to pay the amount or post the bond will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Service shall not be disconnected because of any disputed matter while the disputed matter is being pursued under the disputes procedure. In no way does this relieve the customer from the obligation of paying charges which are not disputed. 
4.  The form of disconnection notice to be used is pursuant to Wis. Adm. Code PSC 1.01 Chapter 185. 
5.  In the event the utility is not able to collect any bill for water service even though deposit and guarantee rules are on file, the bill may be put upon the tax roll as provided in Section 66.069, Wisconsin Statutes. (Amended during 2001 codification; prior code § 9-2-41) 
13.08.260 - Surreptitious use of water. 
A.  When the utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining his or her supply of water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering of the utility service being delivered to his or her equipment, the utility reserves the right to estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such interference and such bill shall be payable subject to a twenty-four (24) hour disconnection of service. When the utility shall have disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the utility will reconnect the consumer upon the following conditions: 
1.  The consumer will be required to deposit with the utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the payment of the consumer's bills for utility service to the utility; 
2.  The consumer will be required to pay the utility for any and all damages to its equipment on the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering; 
3.  The consumer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the utility against further losses.

Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, except as provided in subsection F of this section. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
F.  Immediate Discontinuation. If it is determined by the water and light commission that a cross connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the city clerk and delivered to the customer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, within ten (10) days of such emergency discontinuance. 
G.  State Code Adopted. The city adopts by reference the state plumbing code of Wisconsin being Chapter H 62, Wisconsin Administrative Code. 
H.  Section Not to Supersede Other Ordinances. This section does not supersede the state plumbing code and any city plumbing ordinances but is supplementary to them. (Prior code § 9-2-49) 
13.08.340 - Private well operations and abandonment. 
A.  Purpose. To prevent unused and/or improperly constructed wells from serving as a passage for contaminated surface or near surface waters or other materials to reach the usable ground water used by the city to provide potable water. Such private wells shall be properly filled and sealed as set forth in this section. 
B.  Coverage. The owners of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley, or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public water main of the city, is required at his or her expense to install a water lateral to connect such facilities directly with the city water main in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within ninety (90) days after date of official notice to do so. Only those private wells for which a well operation permit has been granted by the city clerk shall be exempt from this requirement, subject to the conditions of continued maintenance and operation as set forth in this section. 
C.  Well Operation Permits. An annual permit may be granted to a well owner to operate a well if the following requirements are complied with: 
1.  The well and pump installation meet the requirements of NR 112, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and a well constructor's report is on file with the Department of Natural Resources, or certification of the acceptability of the well has been granted by the private water supply section of the Department of Natural Resources; 
2.  The well has a history of producing safe water and presently produces bacteriologically safe water as evidenced by three samplings two weeks apart; 
3.  The proposed use of the well can be justified as being necessary in addition to water provided by the public water system; 
4.  No physical connection shall exist between the piping, of the public water system and the private well. A fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be filed with the well operation permit application.

F.  Future Private Wells Restricted. The installation of new private wells shall be prohibited in all city zoning districts with the exception of the city's commercial and industrial districts (B-2; B-3 and I-1; I-2 and I-3). Property owners whose property is located in such commercial and/or industrial zoning districts may petition the city's water and light commission for permission to install a private well. The water and light commission is authorized to approve the installation of a new private well if the commission determines that such a new well will not present a threat of contaminating the city's potable water supply. In addition, water generated from the new well shall not be used in place of the city's potable water. Rather, it shall only be used for related industrial and/or business uses. An annual well operation permit must be secured from the city clerk as set forth in section to allow for continual operation of the new well. 
G.  Penalties. Any person, firm or other well owner violating any provision of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), together with the cost of prosecution. Each twenty-four (24) hour period during which violation exists shall be deemed and constitute a separate offense. (Prior code § 9-2-50) 
13.08.350 - Replacement of lead service pipe. 
A.  Purpose. Lead service lines have the potential to leach lead into drinking water. Disturbing or reconnecting to an existing lead service line may increase lead levels in drinking water. Elevated lead levels in drinking water have been determined to cause health problems in young children, pregnant women and their unborn children, and are also potentially harmful to adults. The common council therefore finds it in the public interest to establish a comprehensive program for removing and replacing all lead service lines within and connected to the Sun Prairie Utilities water distribution system. 
B.  Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to Sections 62.11(5) and 196.372, Wisconsin Statutes.

D.  Lead Service Line Replacement Requirement. 
1.  As provided in this ordinance, all existing lead service lines connected to the SPU distribution system shall be replaced with water service lines constructed of materials approved by the city. 
2.  Where both the customer-side and utility-side service lines are constructed of lead, the replacement of both sides of the service line shall be completed at the same time following the process set out in subsection F. 
3.  Where only the customer-side service line is constructed of lead, the replacement of the customer-side LSL shall be completed within thirty-six (36) months of notification by SPU following the process set out in subsection G. 
E.  Identification of Customer-Side Lead Service Lines. 
1.  SPU will create a contact list of homes that potentially have lead service lines based on the building's date of construction. 
2.  Upon notice from SPU, a property owner or customer who exercises control over a property connected to the SPU Distribution System shall schedule an inspection of the customer-side service line by an authorized SPU water operator in order to allow SPU to confirm the service line's material of construction. SPU may use various methods to contact the property owner or customer, including but not limited to phone calls, bill stuffers, emails, mailers, and door-to-door contact. 
3.  In the event that a property owner or customer refuses or fails to provide access to the interior of any improvement in order to accomplish such inspection, the utility manager shall take the steps necessary to complete the inspection and confirm the service line's material of construction, including and up to the issuance of non-compliance penalties. 
4.  As an alternative to SPU inspection, the property owner or customer may arrange to have a plumbing contractor perform the inspection and provide inspection results to SPU. This option is not available if a utility-side LSL replacement is being conducted.

6.  SPU shall create and maintain records of all inspected, identified and replaced lead service lines in the city, until such time that no lead service lines exist. 
F.  Replacement of Customer-Side Lead Service Lines in conjunction with replacement of Utility-Side Lead Service Lines. 
1.  Although not prevalent, the SPU distribution system contains a very small percentage of utility-side lead service lines. Utility-side LSLs will be replaced as part of a city street reconstruction project if possible. Before undertaking a project which will replace utility-side LSLs, SPU shall identify those properties that connect to the utility-side LSLs planned for replacement. 
2.  Prior to scheduling the replacement of utility-side LSLs, a certified SPU water operator or SPU employee proficient at determining lead service line materials, shall inspect all connected and affected customer-side service lines for the presence of lead. 
3.  If a customer-side service line is found to be constructed of lead, SPU will notify the property owner of that fact in writing. SPU will also notify the property owner that the property owner must replace the customer-side LSL in conjunction with SPU's scheduled replacement of the utility-side LSL, and that failure to do so may subject the property owner to non-compliance penalties. 
4.  At least forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled replacement of the utility-side LSL, SPU shall notify the property owner with a customer-side LSL in writing of the scheduled date of replacement of the utility-side LSL. 
5.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the replacement notice, the property owner must schedule the replacement of the customer-side LSL to coincide with the scheduled replacement of the utility-side LSL. The property owner shall promptly notify SPU that the replacement of the customer-side LSL has been scheduled and provide the name of the plumbing contractor who will complete the replacement work. 
6.  Upon a property owner's request, SPU may assist the property owner with getting bids from plumbing contractors. SPU's contractor for utility-side LSL replacement work may be available to perform customer-side LSL replacement work. 
7.  Customer-side LSL replacement work must be completed at the same time as the utility-side LSL is replaced unless an extension is allowed under paragraph 8. Failure to commence customer-side LSL replacement work as required by this ordinance or to complete such work within a reasonable time after commencement of the work, may result in the issuance of non-compliance penalties. 
8.  Upon the property owner's written request, and with the property owner's demonstration of a compelling need, the utility manager may, at his or her discretion, extend the time for replacing the customer-side LSL, unless the utility manager determines that granting such an extension will create an imminent threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
9.  A property owner who follows the procedures detailed in both this subsection and subsection H may be eligible to receive financial assistance for the customer-side LSL replacement. 
G.  Replacement of Customer-side Lead Service Line where only the Customer-Side portion of the Service Line is Lead. 
1.  If SPU confirms that a customer-side service line is constructed of lead and notifies the property owner of that fact in writing as provided by subsection E, the property owner must, unless subsection F applies, arrange for the replacement of the customer-side LSL to be completed within thirty-six (36) months of notification. Failure to complete the replacement of the customer-side LSL within that time period may result in non-compliance penalties. 
2.  Upon the property owner's written request, and with the property owner's demonstration of a compelling need, the utility manager may, at his or her discretion, extend the time for replacing the customer-side LSL, unless the utility manager determines that granting such an extension will create an imminent threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
3.  A property owner who follows the procedures detailed in both this subsection and subsection H may be eligible to receive financial assistance for the customer-side LSL replacement. 
H.  Financial Assistance for Customer-Side LSL Replacements. 
1.  SPU is authorized to establish a program to provide eligible property owners with financial assistance to replace customer-side LSLs. SPU must seek PSC approval of any SPU financial assistance program to replace customer-side LSLs. If SPU's financial assistance program has received PSC approval and has available funding, SPU may provide eligible property owners with financial assistance to replace customer-side LSLs as provided in this subsection H. 
2.  SPU may provide an eligible property owner with financial assistance to pay the property owner's customer-side LSL replacement costs. SPU may provide a grant to pay for up to fifty percent (50%) of the property owner's customer-side LSL replacement costs. The grant may not exceed a maximum amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). Financial assistance for the remainder of the property owner's customer-side LSL replacement costs may be provided in the form of a loan. 
3.  SPU may loan an eligible property owner funds to pay the property owner's remaining customer-side LSL replacement cost after the receipt of any grant monies under paragraph 2. SPU may provide an eligible property owner a sixty-month, zero percent interest, loan. The amount of the loan shall be no greater than the lowest bid amount under paragraph 6, less any grant monies awarded under paragraph 2. A property owner shall repay the loan in equal monthly installments. Loan repayments shall be included on SPU's monthly utility bill. Loan repayments that are past due may be placed on the property tax roll as provided in Section 66.0809, Wisconsin Statutes. 
4.  A property owner is eligible for financial assistance for the purpose of replacing the customer-side LSL if the property owner satisfies all of the following criteria: 
a.  The property owner alone, or collectively with others, owns the entire fee simple title to the property served by the customer-side LSL. 
b.  The property owner's customer-side LSL is either attached to a utility-side service line that is not a LSL, or a utility-side LSL scheduled for replacement and for which the property owner has been notified by SPU of such scheduled replacement. 
c.  The property owner agrees to have the replacement work done by a utility-approved plumbing contractor in compliance with this ordinance. 
5.  Written applications for financial assistance shall include the following: 
a.  A completed application on a form furnished by SPU signed by the eligible property owner. The completed application form shall include a certification by the property owner that attests that all eligibility criteria listed in paragraph 4 are met. 
b.  Copies of written quotes from at least two pre-qualified plumbing contractors for the replacement of the property owner's customer-side LSL. A pre-qualified plumbing contractor is one that has gone through the approval process and been placed on SPU's prequalified plumbing contractor list. To be placed on the prequalified plumbing contractors list, a licensed Wisconsin plumbing contractor must fill out a prequalification form at the SPU office located at 125 West Main Street in Sun Prairie and be officially approved by SPU. 
6.  A property owner will be eligible for financial assistance based only on the lowest bid amount included in the written quotes received from the pre-qualified plumbing contractors under paragraph 5.b., unless an extraneous circumstance exists that will require the approval of the utility manager. In general, financial assistance amounts will strictly be on base bid pricing and will not include change orders. In certain circumstances and where deemed appropriate, the utility manager, in conjunction with the property owner, may approve a contractor requested change order for inclusion in the financial assistance portion of the work. 
7.  After a complete application is received, and prior to the commencement of any replacement work, SPU shall determine if the property owner is eligible for financial assistance, and the amount of financial assistance available as a grant and the amount of financial assistance available as a loan. Such determination shall be provided in writing to the applying property owner. 
8.  Customer-side LSL replacement work must be accomplished in a workmanlike manner and be coordinated with any SPU utility-side LSL replacement work as required by subsection F. 
9.  Upon completion of the customer-side LSL replacement, the property owner shall provide SPU with a copy of the invoice from the plumbing contractor. Upon proof of completion satisfactory to the property owner and SPU, SPU shall directly pay the plumbing contractor the amount of money approved by SPU for financial assistance for replacement of the customer-side LSL. SPU shall provide the property owner with documentation of such payment. 
10.  The total amount of money provided by SPU as financial assistance in the form of a grant and loan may not exceed the actual cost of replacement of the customer-side LSL. 
11.  Disputes regarding eligibility for financial assistance may be appealed to the Sun Prairie Utilities Commission. 
I.  Severability. If any subsection or portion of this ordinance is for any reason determined to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, that subsection or portion shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity of the remaining subsections or portions of this ordinance. 
J.  Authority to Discontinue Service. If a property owner fails to replace a customer-side LSL as required by this ordinance, SPU may in accordance with its water utility tariffs discontinue water service to such property until the customer-side LSL is replaced.

1.  For residential and commercial service; and 
2.  For service to establishments producing industrial wastes. 
    In either case, the owner or the owner's agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgement of the building inspector. A permit and inspection fee as provided in Title 15 of the Sun Prairie Municipal Code shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. 
C.  A sewer connection fee shall be charged to each new residential, commercial, industrial, and public authority unit. Further, if an existing commercial, industrial or public authority unit expands its operation such that the expansion results in increased flows to the sewer system, the city shall assess an additional connection fee for the additional flows. 
    These fees are being imposed to defray the costs of increased treatment plant capacity which will be necessary as a direct result of additional new users and expanded use by existing users, and changes in state regulation. Fees are based in part on findings identified by the city's finance committee that are based on the 2003 Wastewater Facility Plan and the 2005 Financial Strategies for Wastewater Treatment Plant Construction Study. (The complete studies and analysis are available in the city clerk's office.) 
1.  Residential Units. The connection fee for residential units shall be as set by resolution of the common council. 
    The sewer connection fee shall remain at the old rate of fifty-five dollars ($55.00) for single-family units (plus thirty dollar ($30.00) inspection fee) for all platted lots with executed developers agreement signed by both the city and developer prior to July 15, 1991. 
2.  Commercial. Industrial, Public Authority Units. The connection fee for commercial, industrial and public authority units shall be the greater of: the equivalent connection fee for a single-family unit, or the volume connection fee based on annual water usage as set by resolution of the common council. The volume connection fee shall be calculated by multiplying the estimated annual water usage by the volume connection charge. The volume connection fee shall be determined by the superintendent of wastewater treatment based on water use estimates provided by the user. 
    The city shall review the estimated connection charges after twelve (12) consecutive months of operation at ninety-five percent (95%) or more capacity. The connection fee shall be increased or decreased based on the actual water usage and calculated volume connection fee. Any additional fees shall be due to the city within thirty (30) days. Refunds to the user shall be issued within thirty (30) days. 
3.  All revenues generated through the collection of the sewer connection fee shall be placed into a special escrow account. These funds shall only be used for the expansion of the treatment capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, when such expansion is determined to be necessary by the common council, and are not intended to be used for the entire expansion deemed necessary, but only for that proportion of expansion reasonably attributable to the users which have been charged fees under this section. 
4.  A two-year review of the sewer connection fee shall be conducted by the finance committee. 
D.  Main Interceptor Improvement Fee. 
1.  Upgrades will be necessary in the future to accommodate increased flow into the forty-two-inch main interceptor that connects directly to the wastewater treatment plant. 
2.  In addition, a pinch point has been identified between main interceptor manholes 12-17 to 12-5. An upgrade will be necessary in the future to accommodate increased flow.

This fee shall be used for upgrades to the forty-two-inch interceptor that connects to the wastewater treatment plant and a portion of the main interceptor, between manholes 12-17 to 12-5, where future upgrades will be needed to accommodate increased flows. 
E.  All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
F.  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building intended for human habitation or occupancy. 
G.  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the building inspector to meet all requirements of this chapter. 
H.  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city.

C.  The Council May Cause Connection at Expense of Owner. If the owner or his or her agent fails to comply with the notice of the council within ninety (90) days of service or mailing thereof, the council may cause connection to be made and the expense thereof shall be assessed as a special tax against the property. 
D.  Installment Option. The owner or his or her agent may, within thirty (30) days after completion of the work, file a written option with the city clerk stating that he cannot pay the cost of connection in one sum and electing that such sum be levied in equal installments with interest at a rate determined by the common council in accordance with the city special assessment ordinance. 
E.  Privies, Cesspools, Etc., Prohibited After Connection with Sewer. After connection of any building used for human habitation to a sewer main, no privy, cesspool or waterless toilet shall be used in connection with such human habitation.

13.12.270 - Permit required. 
    It is unlawful to discharge to any natural waterway within the city to the city's storm sewer system or in any other area under the jurisdiction of the city any sewage or other polluted waters, without first obtaining a Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (WPDES permit). 
(Prior code § 9-3-32) 
13.12.280 - Normal sewage service charge. 
A.  There is levied and assessed upon each lot or parcel of land with a building having a lateral available to discharge normal sewage to the public sewer system, a wastewater service charge based upon rates established by the common council of the city. Such charges shall be assessed and collected by the water utility. 
B.  If any customers obtain all or part of their water from sources other than the public water utility, all or any part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the customer shall be required to have a water meter or meters installed for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. The water meters shall be furnished by the water pollution control department. All costs in connection with the water meter installation shall be at the expense of the customer. The water pollution control department will charge for each meter at the rate of fifty percent (50%) of the minimum water service charge set for that size meter to compensate for furnishing, reading and servicing the meter. This charge shall be in addition to the wastewater service charge. 
(Prior code § 9-3-40) 
13.12.290 - Minimum sewer sewage charge. 
    The "minimum" monthly wastewater service charge shall be as set by resolution of the common council. 
(Ord. 2003-99, § 3, 2003; Ord. 307, § 1, 1994; prior code § 9-3-41) 
13.12.300 - Volume charge. 
A.  In addition to the minimum charge based on meter size, there shall be a charge for all flows based on water usage as determined by the water utility and set by resolution of the common council. 
B.  The above volume charge shall be effective for all commercial, industrial, residential property and public authority serviced by the city's sewer utility with the following exception: 
1.  Residential Summer Sewer Charge Averaging Method. Residential sewer customers shall pay the volume charge as set forth in this section for the month of September through April inclusive which shall be calculated based on the total water usage as determined by the water utility. However, during the months of May through August inclusive, the following method for calculating the volume charge shall be used: 
    During the month of May each year the water utility shall calculate the eight month average water usage for each residential customer. The eight month average shall be used on the actual water usage during the preceding eight-month period (September through April inclusive). The calculated average for each respective residential customer shall be increased by a factor of ten percent (10%) to establish the residential customers summer sewer volume charge. The summer sewer volume charge shall be used to calculate each respective residential customer's sewer charge during the months of May, June, July and August. In the event that a residential customer's actual monthly water usage is less than the calculated average summer sewer volume charge the customer's sewer charge shall be based on the actual water usage for each respective month. 
2.  When calculating the summer sewer volume charge as per paragraph 1., any month(s) from September through April when the actual water usage is less than fifty percent (50%) of the calculated average of that period, that month(s) water usage shall not be used in determining the summer sewer volume charge. Further, whenever a minimum of four months of usable water data is not available for determining the summer volume charge, the summer sewer volume charge shall be based on the city's average residential sewer usage for September through April plus ten percent (10%). 
(Ord. 243, § 1, 2-21-2006; Ord. 2003-99, § 4, 2003; Ord. 307, § 2, 1994; prior code § 9-3-42) 
13.12.310 - Industrial and commercial charges for other than normal wastewater. 
A.  Charges for wastewater other than normal wastewater shall be based on flow, BOD, suspended solids, phosphorous, and such other constituents which affect the cost of collection and treatment. Charges shall be made in accordance with rates established by the common council of the city as set forth in subsection C of this section. 
B.  All persons discharging wastes into the public sewers are subject to a surcharge, in addition to any other wastewater service charge, if their wastewater has a concentration greater than "normal" concentrations (see definition). The volume of flow used for computing waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption, subject to adjustments as otherwise herein provided, or the actual volume of waste as determined by an industrial waste metering installation. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the water pollution control department in removing BOD, suspended solids, phosphorous, and other pertinent constituents. 
C.  Rates of Surcharge. The rates of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents will be set by resolution of the common council. 
D.  In addition to the above surcharges, the water pollution control department's costs of sampling and analyzing industrial wastes shall be charged to the applicable industry. 
E.  Where industrial wastes are of such strength or magnitude or are delivered over such a period of time that the above surcharges do not reflect the actual cost of treatment to the water pollution control department, the department reserves the right to establish a special charge for handling the waste. That portion of the charge related to capital investment shall be based on the design capacity required for the particular waste. In no event shall the charges be less than those charges determined by applying the above surcharge. 
(Ord. 2003-99, § 5, 2003; Ord. 307, § 3, 1994; prior code § 9-3-43) 
13.12.320 - Sewer charge adjustment. 
A.  Sewer use charge adjustments will be made on the basis of the amount of water metered during the same billing month for the previous year unless it can be shown that a significant change in water use has occurred. If a significant change in water use has occurred, the sewer use charge adjustment shall be made upon the average monthly amount of water metered during the previous twelve-month period before the significant change occurred. 
B.  Sewer use charge adjustments shall not be made for water metered for construction use, water metered to fill swimming pools, changes in metered volumes due to a change in water meters, changes in metered volumes due to negligence of the property owner or tenant, or any water metered other than due to faulty plumbing. 
C.  Adjustments to the sewer use charge will be made at fifty percent (50%) of the excess water, if the excess water usage was due to faulty plumbing or vandalism/criminal damage and entered the sanitary sewers. It will be assumed that the water did enter the sanitary sewer system unless the property owner can prove that in fact the water did not enter the sanitary sewer system. Valid receipts, witness, or other means of proof accepted by the wastewater treatment superintendent will be accepted as adequate. 
D.  Adjustments to the sewer use charge will be made for one hundred percent (100%) of the excess water, if it can be shown that the excess water usage was due to, watering new lawn prior to start date or after ending date of the summer sewer averaging program or faulty plumbing or vandalism/criminal damage and water did not enter the sanitary sewers. The burden of proof, as identified above, will be with the property owner. 
E.  Adjustments to the sewer use charge will be considered if the excess water used is at least two hundred percent (200%) above the water metered during the same billing month from the previous year. 
F.  Only one sewer use charge adjustment per meter will be permitted for any twelve-month period. 
G.  Sewer use charge adjustments will only be made to charges occurring during one monthly billing period. Any additional sanitary sewer expenses beyond one monthly billing period will be the total responsibility of the property owner (or tenant). 
H.  Sewer charge adjustments will be administered by the wastewater treatment superintendent. 
I.  1.  If the property owner (or tenant) does not agree with the decisions made by the wastewater treatment superintendent, he or she may appeal the decision to the public works committee. The public works committee shall review each situation to ensure that the decision rendered by the wastewater treatment superintendent is consistent within the guidelines established in this chapter. The public works committee shall either uphold or amend the wastewater treatment superintendent's decision based on the variables involved. 
2.  If in the wastewater treatment superintendent's opinion there exists a special situation or extraordinary circumstance that is not adequately covered in this policy, he or she shall refer the matter to the public works committee with a written report and recommendation. The item will be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the public works committee. The public works committee shall review the item and render a decision based upon the information presented. The decision of the public works committee shall be final.

Chapter 13.14 - STORMWATER UTILITY 
Sections: 

13.14.010 - Purpose and necessity-Authorization. 
    The city council of the city finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within the Upper Koshkonong Creek, Yahara River and Lake Mendota Watershed (Token Creek) and Maunesha River watersheds is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city. A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas including those properties not currently serve by the systems. The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the city council hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services adopting and publishing as required by law the regulations contained in this chapter, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by Chapters 62 and 66, Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Ord. 70, § 1, 2002) 
13.14.020 - Creation. 
    There is hereby established a stormwater utility in the city. The operation of the stormwater utility shall be under the supervision of the city council. The city administrator or his/her designee will oversee and be in charge of the utility. 
(Ord. 70, § 2, 2002) 
13.14.030 - Authority of the stormwater utility. 
    The city, acting through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance such facilities, operations and activities, as are deemed by the city to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation due to enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls, ponds, basins, streets, roads, ditches and such other facilities as will support a stormwater management system.

Failure of the property owner to connect within the time period specified in said notice shall result in said connection being made by the city and all charges being assessed against the property as a special charge. 
(Ord. 70, § 5, 2002) 
13.14.060 - Stormwater utility rates. 
A.  Introduction. The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility to lots and parcels of land within the city is established under this section. The actual rate of charges to be imposed and any future changes in those rates may be made by resolution. All rates established pursuant to this chapter shall be fair and reasonable. A schedule of current charges shall be maintained and on file in the office of the city clerk. 
B.  1.  Exemptions. Exemptions to the charges comprising the stormwater utility charge are established in recognition that, in limited circumstances, properties may not benefit directly from all services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility. Owners of property satisfying the following criteria may apply to the city for an exemption from the equivalent runoff unit as described in this section. 
a.  Discharges to Surface Water Bodies. If more than half, as determined by the city engineer, of a customer's property drains directly into the Upper Koshkonong Creek downstream from the Koshkonong Stormwater Management Facility, Yahara River and Lake Mendota Watershed (Token Creek), Maunesha River or any tributaries draining to these water bodies, the city may, upon customer request, exempt the customer from a portion of the charge, provided that (i) the discharge is direct and not through any portion of the stormwater conveyance system owned or operated by the stormwater utility, and (ii) the drainage is not in violation of any environmental code or federal, state or local surface water drainage requirements and all required permits for said discharges have been granted. 
b.  From time to time the public works committee may adopt additional criteria under which owners may be eligible for exemptions to the charges comprising the stormwater utility charge. 
2.  Credits. Credits may be granted to owners of properties who have significantly reduced the impacts of stormwater discharge on the stormwater utility system. Owners of property which discharge all or a portion of their stormwater into privately owned and maintained stormwater facilities shall receive a prorated credit to the number of ERUs assigned to their property as determined by the city engineer. No owner may be given a credit in excess of sixty-five percent (65%) of their total number of ERUs. 
3.  Prior to receiving a credit or exemption, the city engineer or designee shall be allowed access to the property to determine the amount of credit or exemption to be granted. 
(Ord. 349, § 2, 12-18-2007; Ord. 70, § 6, 2002) 
13.14.070 - Billing. 
A.  The city department of finance is hereby appointed as the collection agency for the city stormwater utility. The city department of finance may contract for the billing and collection of stormwater fees. The department of finance shall allocate the actual cost incurred of billing and collecting to the expense of systemwide management and administration of the stormwater utility. 
B.  The bills for stormwater utility charges shall be mailed to the designated utility bill recipient, but this mailing shall not relieve the owner of the property from liability for rental property in the event payment is not made as required in this article. The owner of any property served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid for such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
C.  Stormwater utility charges shall not be payable in installments.

A.  For the purposes of imposing the stormwater utility charge, all lots and parcels within the city are classified into the following customer classes: 
1.  Residential - single-family home and mobile home; 
2.  Residential - duplex; 
3.  Residential - multifamily and condominium; 
4.  Nonresidential; or 
5.  Undeveloped. 
B.  The city engineer or designee shall prepare a list of lots and parcels within the city and assign one of the classifications provided in subsection A.1. through 5. to each lot or parcel. 
C.  The average square footage of impervious area for an average single-family home in the city equal to one ERU shall be three thousand four hundred sixty-eight (3,468) square feet. 
D.  The charges imposed upon single-family and mobile home residential properties shall be the rate for one ERU. 
E.  The charges imposed upon duplex residential properties and condominiums of two units shall be the rate for sixty-five percent (65%) of one ERU (.65) for each unit. 
F.  The charges imposed upon multifamily and condominiums with three units or more shall be the minimum rate of four-tenths (0.4) of one ERU multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units existing on the property. Upon the owner's request, multifamily or mixed use properties may be treated as nonresidential properties as described in Section 13.14.080.G., provided the owner takes responsibility for the charge. 
G.  The charges imposed upon nonresidential property shall be determined by a rate for one ERU times a factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of the nonresidential property by the square footage equivalent for one ERU. Such impervious area shall be determined based on the best information reasonably available. The result shall be rounded down to the nearest one-tenth (0.1). 
Actual Square Footage Charge = of Impervious Surface x rate for 1 ERU 3468 Square Feet  
H.  The charges imposed for undeveloped properties as defined herein shall be the rate for one ERU multiplied by a factor established by resolution. 
I.  The city engineer or designee shall be responsible for determining the impervious area based on the best available information including, but not limited to, data supplied by the city assessor, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or developer. The city engineer or designee may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. The city engineer or his designee shall be allowed access on reasonable notice to the property owner in order to conduct measurements in order to determine impervious area. If access is denied, impervious area shall be presumed to be ninety-five percent (95%) of the total square footage of the property. The billing amount shall be updated by the city engineer or designee based on any additions to the impervious area as approved through the building permit process. 
J.  The minimum charges for any nonresidential unit and multifamily unit shall be equal to the rate for four-tenths (0.4) of one ERU, unless it contains no impervious surface. 
K.  All unoccupied developed lots and parcels with impervious surfaces shall be subject to a stormwater utility charge.

2.  Within thirty (30) days of payment, a written challenge to the stormwater utility charge must be filed with the city clerk on behalf of the customer, specifying all bases for the challenge and the amount of the stormwater utility charge the customer asserts is inappropriate. Failure to file a challenge within thirty (30) days of payment waives all right to later challenge the charge. 
3.  The disputed charge shall be held in abeyance until the public works committee has made a determination pursuant to subsection B. of this section. 
B.  The public works committee will determine whether the stormwater utility charge is fair and reasonable, or whether a refund is due the customer. The committee may act with a hearing and will inform the customer in writing of its decision. The committee may, at its discretion, require access to the property to assist in its determination. 
C.  The customer has thirty (30) days from the decision of the public works committee to file a written appeal to the common council. 
D.  If the council or the public works committee determines that a refund is due the customer, the refund will be applied as a credit on the customer's next monthly stormwater billing, if the refund will not exceed the customer's next quarterly stormwater billing, or will be refunded at the discretion of the city treasurer. 
(Ord. 70, § 10, 2002) 
13.14.110 - Special charge authority.

Every such permit issued by the building inspector for the moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken, the conditions to be complied with, and shall limit the time during which such moving operations shall be continued. 
2.  A report shall be made by the public works director with regard to possible damage to trees or the required movement of any public utilities and/or improvements. The estimated cost of trimming, removing and replacement of public trees, or the required movement of any public utilities and an improvement shall be determined by the public works director and shall be paid to the director of finance prior to issuance of the moving permit. 
3.  Issuance of moving permit shall further be conditioned on approval of the moving route by the public works director and chief of police. 
B.  Continuous Movement. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous operation during all the hours of the day, and at night, until such movement is fully completed. All of such operations shall be performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street crossing or intersection, or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lights shall be kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night. 
C.  Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall within one day after such building reaches its destination, report that fact to the building inspector who shall thereupon in the company of the public works director, inspect the streets, highways, and curbs and gutters over which such building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If the removal of such building has caused any damage to any street or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the failure of such permittee to do so within ten (10) days thereafter to the satisfaction of the director of public works, the city shall repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his or her bond responsible for the payment of same. 
D.  Conformance with Code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the city and to establish it upon a location within the city until the building inspector has made an investigation of such building at the location from which it is to be moved, and is satisfied from such investigation that such building is in a sound and stable condition and of such construction that it will meet the requirements of this building code in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the building inspector, and he or she shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this building code, and that when same are completed, the building as such will so comply with such building code. In the event a building is to be moved from the city to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed alterations to such building, may be disregarded. 
E.  Bond. 
1.  Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way in the city, the party applying therefor shall give a bond to the city in a sum to be fixed by the director of public works and which shall not be less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00); such bond to be executed by a corporate surety or two personal sureties to be approved by the director of public works or designated agent conditioned upon, among other things, the indemnification to the city for any costs or expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or property, and the payment of any judgement together with the costs and expenses incurred by the city in connection therewith, arising out of the removal of the building for which the permit is issued. 
2.  Unless the building inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building from its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or the location, nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the exposed excavation, such as to make intrusion upon the premises and the falling into such excavation of children under twelve (12) years of age unlikely, the bond required by subsection (E)(1) of this section shall be further conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate barriers and within forty-eight (48) hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the building inspector and reasonable adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set forth herein. 
F.  Insurance. The building inspector shall require in addition to such bond above indicated, public liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum of not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) and for one accident in a sum not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), together with property damage insurance in a sum not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), or such other coverage as deemed necessary.

No such permit shall be issued unless it has been found as a fact by the plan commission of the city by at least a majority vote, after an examination of the application for the permit which shall include exterior elevations of the building and accurate photographs of all sides and views of the same, and in case it is proposed to alter the exterior of such building, plans and specifications of such proposed alterations and after a view of the building proposed to be moved and of the site at which it is to be located, that the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the building to be moved or moved and altered, will not be so at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the buildings already constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood, or the character of the applicable district established by the zoning ordinances of the city or any ordinance amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values of such neighborhood within such applicable district. In case the applicant proposes to alter the exterior of such building after moving the same, he or she shall submit with his or her application papers, complete plans and specifications for the proposed alterations. Before a permit shall be issued for a building to be moved and altered, the applicant shall give a bond to the city, which shall not be less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to be executed in the manner provided in subsection E of this section to the effect that he or she will within a time to be set by the plan commission, complete the proposed exterior alterations to such building in the manner set forth in his or her plans and specifications. This bond shall be in addition to any other bond or surety which may be required by other applicable ordinances of the city. No occupancy permit shall be issued for such building until the exterior alterations proposed to be made have been completed. 
2.  Upon application being made to the building inspector, he or she shall request a meeting of the plan commission to consider applications for moving permits which he or she has found comply in all respects with all other ordinances of the city. The plan commission may, if it desires, hear the applicant for the moving permit in question and/or the owner of the lot on which it is proposed to locate the building in question, together with any other persons, either residents or property owners, desiring to be heard, giving such notice of hearing as they may deem sufficient.

Chapter 15.24 - HANDICAPPED ACCESS TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
Sections: 

15.24.010 - Grievance procedures regarding access to public buildings by handicapped persons. 
A.  Statement of Purpose. The city is committed to providing adequate access by handicapped or visually impaired persons to public buildings financed in part by federal revenue sharing. This section provides for a grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office of Revenue Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2)) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified handicapped individual...shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance..." 
B.  Complaint Procedure. 
1.  Complaints should be filed with the city administrator, who has been designated to coordinate Section 504 Compliance. 
2.  A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations. 
3.  A complaint should be filed within thirty (30) days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.) 
4.  An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint. The investigation will be conducted by an appropriate person designated by the city administrator who should review the Handicapped Requirements Handbook published by the Federal Programs Advisory Service. 
5.  A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of resolution, if any, shall be issued by the designated person and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than thirty (30) days after its filing. 
6.  The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the city relating to the complaints filed. 
C.  Appeals. 
1.  The complainant may appeal the decision of the Section 504 coordinator where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The appeal request shall be made within seven days to the city administrator. 
2.  The grievance shall be heard by the common council within ten (10) working days after the filing of an appeals request. The grievance shall be heard at the municipal building at a convenient time fixed by the council. The city clerk shall give at least three days written notice to the applicant by first class mail of any such grievance hearing. 
3.  Either party to the grievance may be represented, present evidence by testimony or otherwise, cross-examine witnesses and make argument either in person or by an agent of his or her choosing. Proceedings may and, upon request of the applicant, shall be recorded. 
4.  The decision of the common council on the grievance appeal shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The decision of the council shall be rendered within three working days of the close of the hearing and the common council shall immediately upon rendering the decision mail a copy thereof by first class mail to the applicant at the current post office address given in his or her application and record a copy of its determination with the city clerk. 
D.  Other Remedies. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. However, the city believes that resolution of the complaint will be more promptly achieved if the city is able to provide a remedy before the complaint is brought to an external organization. 
E.  Due Process. This section shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the city complies with Section 504 and the ORS regulations.

    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority of and in accordance with the standards set forth in Sections 62.23, 62.234, 101.1205, 101.653 and 281.33, Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 2001; prior code § 15-4-1) 
15.28.020 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Findings. The common council finds as follows: 
1.  Stormwater runoff from construction sites and from lands after development carries a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the waters of the state and the City of Sun Prairie. 
2.  The city has had in place an erosion control ordinance since at least December 17, 1991 (when it adopted Ordinance No. 204) to regulate land disturbing and land developing activities on lands within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the city and the public and private lands subject to extraterritorial review under Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes. 
3.  Recent developments in erosion control practices suggest a substantial need to incorporate current best practices into the city's erosion control ordinance. 
4.  This ordinance is intended to achieve an eighty percent (80%) reduction in sediment load rates to Dane County waters in all new developments, forty percent (40%) reduction in all redevelopments, and twenty percent (20%) reduction in existing developments. 
5.  This ordinance is intended to ensure no increase in temperature of stormwater runoff in order to protect cold water communities. 
B.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to protect natural resources; to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; to prevent and control water pollution; to protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; to control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; to preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and to promote sound economic growth.

15.28.050 - Design standards and specifications for erosion control measures. 
A.  The applicant for a permit may employ structural or nonstructural measures necessary to achieve all applicable standards set out in this chapter. However, these measures will be evaluated to determine that they follow currently accepted design criteria and engineering standards. 
B.  The following general principles shall be used when evaluating control plans and granting permits under this chapter: 
1.  Activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to cause the smallest area of land shall be exposed for the shortest period at any given time during development. 
2.  The rough grading of the lot shall include backfilling the foundation and walls and all excess earth shall be hauled off the lot unless stockpiled and covered to prevent erosion by wind or water. 
3.  Accommodation of any increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. 
4.  Runoff from all areas upslope of the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the receiving channels. 
5.  All roof drainage shall discharge to vegetated, mulched or other stable pervious surface. 
6.  All temporary roadways and parking areas shall be constructed with minimal cuts and on relatively flat grades. All disturbed side slopes shall be stabilized with mulching and seeding or equivalent control measures within seven days of construction of the cuts. 
7.  Permanent final plantings or structures shall be installed prior to final acceptance of public improvements or issuance of occupancy permits. 
8.  The plan of development shall relate to the topography and soils of the site so that the lowest potential for erosion is created. 
9.  Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected and shall be deemed a dominating factor in developing the site and temporary vegetation, mulching or other cover shall be used to protect the area exposed during the land-disturbing activity. 
10.  All detention and retention basins that serve multiple phases or a single drainage area shall first be constructed to act as a settling basin with conversion to the permanent basin upon completion of the development. 
11.  Any soil or dirt piles which will be in existence for more than ten (10) days may not be located within twenty-five (25) feet of a roadway or drainage channel and shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps or other means. 
12.  The developer for all plats or phases thereof shall submit for approval a "post-improvement erosion control plan" that details structural measures and responsibility for erosion control after the initial improvements have been made. The post-improvement erosion control plan shall propose erosion control measures to protect all improvements and include a revegetation schedule for denuded areas that takes into account the time of year. This plan may accompany the initial plan or be submitted separately, but must be approved prior to the city's acceptance of the plat improvements. 
13.  April 30th through November 30th. Prior to acceptance of site improvements or issuance of occupancy permits, the developer's representative shall visit the site with the city's representative to review the final site stabilization measures. The city's representative must approve the final site stabilization measures prior to acceptance of public utilities or issuance of occupancy permits. 
14.  Winter Construction. As soon as weather conditions permit the completion of final site stabilization measures, but prior to acceptance of site improvements or issuance of occupancy permits, the developer's representative shall visit the site with the city's representative to review the final site stabilization measures. The city's representative must approve the final site stabilization measures prior to acceptance of public utilities or issuance of occupancy permits. 
C.  The following erosion control measures shall be required on sites with public improvements: 
1.

Inspection reports shall be prepared and filed as required and submitted to the city's representative within four business days of the required inspection. This shall not relieve the landowner or his/her representative of any responsibilities under NR 216 or Comm. 50.115, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and any other applicable agency regulations, as such regulations may hereafter be amended. 
2.  Disturbed areas more than twenty (20) feet behind the curb and gutter shall be restored when rough grading is completed. If the area will not be seeded and mulched within forty-eight (48) hours of rough grading, silt fence or erosion mat shall be installed parallel to the street twenty (20) feet the curb and gutter until final landscaping is completed. 
3.  Install minimum six foot to seven foot wide erosion mat along the back of curb after topsoil has been placed in the terrace if this area will not be seeded and mulched within forty-eight (48) hours of placing topsoil. 
4.  Silt fence or erosion mat shall be installed along the contours at one hundred (100) foot intervals down the slope on disturbed slopes steeper than five percent and more than one hundred (100) long that sheet flow to the roadway. 
5.  Place heavy mulch twenty (20) feet wide to prevent sediment from leaving the lots. Mulch shall be at least twenty (20) mm thick in accordance with latest edition of the state of Wisconsin Standard Specifications for Highway and Structure Construction. Seed and double mulch all terraces. 
6.  Clean sediment from curb and gutter on a daily basis, more often if needed after a rain event, and prior to the project acceptance.

8.  Catch-all inlet protection devices, or equal as determined by the city engineer, shall be installed in all storm sewer catch basins and maintained until the final surface layer of asphalt has been placed in new developments. The devices shall also be placed and maintained in additional locations, such as catch basins down gradient of the development, as determined by the city engineer. 
D.  Erosion control measures shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook and the city standard specifications for public works improvements. 
E.  Riprap design for culvert, pond, and storm sewer outfalls shall be in accordance with the state of Wisconsin Department of Transportation Facilities Development Manual Drainage Chapter, Erosion and Water Pollution Control Section. Riprap construction shall be in accordance with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Highway and Structure Construction, latest edition. 
F.  Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be free of visible sediments and shall be discharged to drainage facilities so as not to cause erosion at the discharge point or in the receiving drainage facility. 
G.  Waste and Material Disposal. All waste and unused building materials shall be disposed of frequently and in licensed solid waste or wastewater facilities. No garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, toxic materials or hazardous materials shall be buried on site, dumped on the land surface or in detention basins, or discharged or otherwise allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.

Chapter 15.30 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
Sections: 

15.30.010 - Title and authority. 
    The chapter shall be known as the "Stormwater Management Ordinance" and is adopted pursuant to Section 62.11(5), Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Ord. 2002-60 § 1, 2002) 
15.30.020 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Findings. The common council finds as follows: 
1.  Uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development has significant adverse impacts on water resources and the health, safety, property and general welfare of the community, and can diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, stormwater runoff can: 
a.  Carry sediment, nutrients, pathogens, organic matter, heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants to regional lakes, streams and wetlands; 
b.  Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life; 
c.  Clog existing drainage systems, increasing maintenance problems and costs; 
d.  Cause bank and channel erosion; 
e.  Increase downstream flooding; 
f.  Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in regional lakes, ponds and wetlands; 
g.  Contaminate drinking water supplies; 
h.  Increase risk of property damage and personal injury, and; 
i.  Cause damage to agricultural fields and crops. 
2.  That effective sediment and stormwater management depends on proper planning, design, and timely installation of conservation and management practices and their continuing maintenance. 
3.  Recent developments in stormwater management practices suggest a need to incorporate current practices into the city's stormwater management ordinance. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  It is the purpose of this chapter to set forth the minimum requirements for stormwater management that when incorporated will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the city of Sun Prairie. 
2.  This chapter is intended to regulate stormwater runoff with the intentions of accomplishing the following objectives: 
a.  Promote regional stormwater management by watershed; 
b.  Minimize sedimentation, water pollution from nutrients, heavy metals, chemical and petroleum products and other contaminants, flooding and thermal impacts to the water resources of the city of Sun Prairie; 
c.  Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge; 
d.  Protect functional values of natural watercourses and wetlands; 
e.  Provide a set of performance standards that are consistent with the standards set forth by Dane County; 
f.  Achieve an eighty percent (80%) reduction in sediment load rates to Dane County waters compared to no controls for all new development, a forty percent (40%) reduction in sediment load rates compared to no controls for all redevelopment and street reconstruction, and a twenty percent (20%) reduction in sediment load rates compared to no controls for existing developments; 
g.  Ensure no increase in temperature of stormwater post-construction in order to protect cold-water communities; 
h.  Ensure no increase in the rate of surface water drainage from sites during or after construction; and 
i.  Protect public and private property from damage resulting from stormwater runoff.

C.  The submitted plan shall include stormwater management performance standards. Proposed design, suggested location and phased implementation of effective, practicable stormwater management measures for plans shall be designed, engineered, and implemented to achieve the following results: 
1.  Sediment Control. 
a.  For new development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than five microns on the site (eighty percent (80%) reduction) resulting from a 1-year, 24-hour storm event (2.49 inches over 24-hour duration), according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. 
b.  For redevelopment resulting in exposed surface parking lots and associated traffic areas, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns on the entire site (forty percent (40%) reduction) resulting from a 1-year 24-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment re-suspension. Under no circumstances shall the site's existing sediment control level or trapping efficiency be reduced as a result of the redevelopment. 
2.  Oil and Grease Control. For all stormwater plans for commercial or industrial developments and all other uses where the potential for pollution by oil or grease, or both, exists, the first one-half inch of runoff will be treated using the best oil and grease removal technology available. This requirement may be waived by the plan reviewer only when the applicant can demonstrate that installation of such practices is not necessary. 
3.  Runoff Rate Control-Hydrologic Calculations. All runoff calculations shall be according to the methodology described in the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" (commonly referred to as TR-55), or other methodology approved by the Dane County Conservationist. For agricultural land subject to this section, the maximum runoff curve number (RCN) used in such calculations shall be 51 for HSG A, 68 for hydrologic Soil Group B, 78 for HSG C, and 83 for HSG D. The TR-55 specified curve numbers for other land uses in heavily disturbed sites will be lowered one permeability class for hydrologic calculations. Lightly disturbed areas require no modification. Where practices have been implemented to restore soil structure to predeveloped conditions, no permeability class modification is required. 
4.  Runoff Rate Control-Design Standards. Except for redevelopment projects, all stormwater facilities shall be designed, installed, and maintained to effectively accomplish the following: 
a.  Maintain the predevelopment peak runoff rates for the 2-year and 5-year, 24-hour storm event (2.84 inches and 3.49 inches respectively over 24 hours duration using the NRCS MSE4 storm distribution). 
b.  Limit the post-development peak runoff rate for the 10-year through the 25-year, 24-hour storm event (4.09 inches and 5.01 inches respectively) to the 5-year predevelopment runoff rate over 24-hour duration using the NRCS MSE4 storm distribution. 
c.  Maintain the predevelopment peak runoff rates for the 100-year, 24-hour storm event (6.66 inches over 24-hour duration using the NRCS MSE4 storm distribution) without inundating buildings. On local streets the depth of water at the crown of the street shall not exceed six inches. On arterial streets and in commercial zoning districts the water level shall not exceed the top of curb elevation and the center twelve (12) feet of the street shall not be inundated. 
5.  Outlets. Discharges from new construction sites must have a stable outlet (as determined by the city engineer) capable of carrying designed flow at a nonerosive velocity. Outlet design must consider flow capacity and flow duration. This requirement applies to both the site outlet and the ultimate outlet to stormwater conveyance or water body. 
6.  Infiltration. 
a.  Residential Development. For residential developments, design practices to infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that post-development infiltration volume shall be at least ninety percent (90%) of the pre-development infiltration volume, based upon average annual rainfall. If when designing appropriate infiltration systems, more than two percent (2%) of the site is required to be used as effective infiltration area, the applicant may alternately design infiltration systems and pervious surfaces to meet or exceed the estimated average annual recharge rate. The annual pre-development recharge rate shall be determined from the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey's 2009 report, Groundwater Recharge in Dane County, estimated by a GIS-based water-balanced model or subsequent updates to this report, or by a site-specific analysis using other appropriate techniques. If this alternative design approach is taken, at least two percent (2%) of the site must be used for infiltration. 
b.  Nonresidential Development. For nonresidential development, including commercial, industrial and institutional development, design practices to infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that post-development infiltration volume shall be at least ninety percent (90%) of the predevelopment infiltration volume, based on average annual rainfall. If when designing appropriate infiltration systems, more than two percent (2%) of the site is required to be used as effective infiltration area, the applicant may alternately design infiltration systems and pervious surfaces to meet or exceed the estimated average annual recharge rate. The annual pre-development recharge rate shall be determined from the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey's 2009 report, Groundwater Recharge in Dane County, estimated by a GIS-based water-balanced model or subsequent updates to this report, or by a site-specific analysis using other appropriate techniques. If this alternative design approach is taken, at least two percent (2%) of the site must be used for infiltration. 
c.  Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and protect groundwater quality. 
d.  Prohibitions. Notwithstanding subparagraphs a. through c., infiltration systems may not be installed in any of the following areas: 
i.  Areas associated with tier 1 industrial facilities identified in Section NR 216.21(2)(a), Wisconsin Administrative Code, including storage, loading, rooftop and parking. 
ii.  Storage and loading areas of tier 2 industrial facilities identified in Section NR 216.21(2)(b), Wisconsin Administrative Code. 
iii.  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. 
iv.  Areas within one thousand (1,000) feet up-gradient or within one hundred (100) feet down-gradient of karst features. 
v.  Areas with less than three feet separation distance from bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock, except that this provision does not prohibit infiltration of roof runoff. 
vi.  Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roads and residential roads with less than five feet separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater of the top of bedrock. 
vii.  Areas within four hundred (400) feet of a community water system well as specified in Section NR 811.16(4), Wisconsin Administrative Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development. 
viii.  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in Section NR 720.03(2), Wisconsin Administrative Code, are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur. 
ix.  Any area where the soil does not exhibit one of the following characteristics between the bottom of the infiltration system and the seasonal high groundwater and top of bedrock: at least a five-foot soil layer with ten percent (10%) fines or greater. This provision does not apply where soil medium within the infiltration system provides an equivalent level of protection and does not prohibit infiltration of roof runoff. 
e.  Alternate Use of Runoff. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section. 
f.  Minimizing Groundwater Pollution. According to Chapter NR 151, Wisconsin Administrative Code, infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventative action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Chapter NR 140, Wisconsin Administrative Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with the preventative action limit is not achievable, the infiltration system may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
7.  Thermal Control. The stormwater management plan shall include provisions and practices to reduce the temperature of runoff for sites located within the watershed of river or stream identified by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as: 
a.  A cold water community as identified through NR 102.04(3)(a), NR 104, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and Class I, Class II, and Class III Trout Streams identified in "Wisconsin trout streams," DNR publication PUB-FH-806-2002 or its successor. 
b.  Rivers or streams proposed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as cold water communities and Class I, II and III Trout Streams. 
8.  Thermal Control-Continued. 
a.  The stormwater management plan does not have to meet the requirement if the applicant can justify by use of a model approved by the Dane County Conservationist that practices are not necessary because the temperature increase of runoff from the site post-development will be zero. 
b.  A current list and maps of affected watersheds is available for reference at the Dane County Land Conservation Office. 
9.  Stormwater Management Goals. The following standards shall be met whenever possible, and proposed design, suggested location and implementation of practices to meet these goals shall be included in plans: 
a.  For existing development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than forty (40) microns on the site (twenty percent (20%) reduction) resulting from a one-year twenty-four (24) hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. 
b.  For street reconstruction, design practices to retain soil particles greater than twenty (20) microns on the site (forty percent (40%) reduction) resulting from a one-year, twenty-four hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension.

15.32.030 - Roadway naming and property addressing procedures. 
A.  Requirement for Naming. 
1.  All public and private roadways within the city shall be named in accordance with the roadway naming standards. 
2.  Plats within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) shall include roadways names. Since the city provides some emergency services in the towns, roadway names within the ETJ will be reviewed by the city to ensure there is no duplication of, or confusion with, roadway names in the city. 
3.  Private driveways must not be signed. The purpose of this is to avoid confusion with private or public roadways. 
B.  Requirement for Property Addressing. Addresses shall be assigned to all lots within the city including outlots. All lots shall have an address. The addresses shall be assigned in accordance with the property addressing standards. 
C.  Department(s) Responsible for Approving Newly Assigned or Changed Roadway Names and Assigned Property Addresses. 
1.  The roadway naming authority shall review proposed roadway names. The roadway naming authority shall be the department of planning and economic development. Fire department, emergency medical services, police department and Sun Prairie public safety communications center representatives shall also review the proposed roadway names to ensure they are acceptable within their respective service areas. 
2.  Property addresses shall be reviewed and approved by the property addressing authority. 
3.  The property addressing authority shall be the building inspection department. 
D.  Department Responsible for Coordination of Roadway Name and Property Address Assignments. 
1.  The information technology department shall be responsible for coordination of the data with the Sun Prairie public safety communications center systems, the city's integrated database and Dane County. 
2.  A list of official roadway names will be prepared and maintained by the information technology department. The official roadway names list shall contain both public and private roadways within the corporate limit and within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
E.  How Roadway Naming and Property Addressing Assignments shall be Initiated. 
1.  When a new roadway is proposed within the city, whether public or private, the names and addresses can be assigned and initiated in one or more of the following ways: 
a.  Preliminary Plat for Major Subdivision. In accordance with Section 16.16.010(C) of the Subdivision Ordinance, roadway names are required on the preliminary plat for a major subdivision. The roadway names proposed on the preliminary plat will be reviewed by the roadway naming authority and ultimately approved by the city council. The roadway type suffix shall be written out on the plat and not abbreviated. 
b.  Final Plat for Major Subdivision. Proposed roadway names are required to be shown on the final plat and will become the official names once the plat has been recorded with the Dane County register of deeds. An addressing plan shall be submitted along with the final plat as required in Section 16.20.020(N) of the city Subdivision Ordinance. Once the addressing plan has been approved, the authorities and plan preparer will sign off on the plan. Since the towns and the county are responsible for addressing in the ETJ area, an addressing plan is not required to be submitted with an ETJ plat. 
c.  Certified Survey Map. Any roadways created by a CSM shall be named in accordance with the roadway naming standards. New addresses will be assigned to newly created lots and outlots on a certified survey map by the property addressing authority. 
d.  Planned Development District General Development Plan (PDDGDP). Any private roadways approved through a Planned Development District General Development Plan shall include roadway names. An addressing plan shall be submitted along with the precise implementation plan (PIP). 
e.  Annexation. When an area is annexed into the city and has a roadway with an existing name, the city roadway naming authority may rename the roadway to comply with the roadway naming standards. The property addressing authority shall assign addresses to all existing parcels within the annexation area including properties with pre-existing addresses. 
F.  Private Roadway Name Changes. Owners of private roadways may initiate a formal name change in writing. Private roadway names may not be changed without written approval by the city's roadway naming authority and the public works committee. 
G.  Property Address Corrections. 
1.  When the property addressing authority determines that an address is not in compliance with the city's standards and it is in the public interest to change an address for the efficient delivery of emergency and other services, the city property addressing authority shall change the address. The property addressing authority shall provide written notification to the property owner at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. 
2.  When a parcel is annexed by the city, the parcel shall be assigned new official property addresses consistent with the property addressing standards of the city. 
3.  When properties are redeveloped, new addresses shall be assigned. (Ord. 2004-127 § 1 (part)) 
15.32.040 - Roadway naming standards. 
    If a proposed roadway is not an extension of an existing roadway, the new roadway names shall be assigned in accordance with the following standards. Names should be pleasant sounding, appropriate, easy to read and pronounce especially in an emergency situation and should add to the pride of the community. 
A.  Selection of Roadway Names. 
1.  Roadway Name Length. Roadway names shall have no fewer than three and no more than fourteen (14) characters. If the roadway will cross a baseline, thereby requiring a directional prefix, then the roadway name shall be limited to twelve (12) characters. A space between two words is considered a character. 
2.  Duplication of Existing Roadway Names. To eliminate potential confusion and delay of emergency response, duplication of roadway names shall not be permitted. Roadways with the same name but different suffix designations shall be considered duplicate roadway names (e.g. Smith Drive and Smith Lane are duplicates). Cul-de-sacs that terminate a through roadway, that have the same name at the roadway but will have the court suffix, are the only exceptions as described in Section 15.32.040(E)(1). 
3.  Similar or Confusing Spelling. To eliminate confusion, names that are difficult to spell, have similar spelling, can be spelled several different ways or have phonetically confusing spelling will not be approved. (e.g. Stonehenge vs. Stonehedge - similar spelling, and Broome vs. Broom - spelled two ways). 
4.  Unconventional Spelling. To avoid confusion and allow for accurate verbal communication in emergency situations, unconventional spelling of words in roadway names shall be prohibited (e.g. Wynd Chime, Golde Bar). 
5.  Multiple Pronunciations. Roadway names that may be pronounced in a number of different ways will not be approved. 
6.  Similar Sounding. Roadway names, which are different but sound similar, will not be approved (e.g. broom and bloom). 
7.  Emergency Confusion. Roadway names that could cause confusion in emergency situations will not be approved (e.g. Fire Lane, Station Street). 
8.  Offensive. Roadways names that may be offensive (Slang, double meanings, etc.) will not be approved. 
9.  Frivolous. Roadway names that are considered frivolous or complicated or have unconventional spellings will not be approved (e.g. I Did It My Way). 
10.  Vanity Names. Roadway names that identify with a specific company or private entity will not be approved for public roadways, but may be approved for private roadways. 
11.  Numbers and Alphabet. Numerical names (1st, second, etc.) or alphabet letter names (A Street, B Drive) will not be approved. 
12.  Use of Roadway Type Suffix or Directional Prefix Words. Roadway names that include the directional prefix or the roadway type suffix, or similar words, as the roadway name or in the roadway name will not be approved (e.g. West Avenue and Melrose Place Drive). 
13.  Abbreviations. Roadway names may not contain abbreviations. For example "Saint" must be written out in full. 
14.  Use of Old/Olde or New. Roadway names that contain the separate word/s old, olde, or new will not be approved (e.g. New Castle, Olde English). 
15.  Punctuation. Punctuation is not allowed in roadway names. Names shall not contain hyphens, apostrophes, or other non-letter characters. 
16.  Capitalization. Upper and lower case characters may not be designated in roadway names. 
17.  Multi-word Roadway Names. Roadway names shall be comprised of no more than two words. A roadway name may only contain one space if it is a multi-word name. 
18.  Other Unacceptable Roadway Names. Roadway names deemed unacceptable by the city roadway naming authority are also prohibited. 
B.  Directional Prefix Designations. Directional prefixes shall only be North, South, East, or West. When a roadway crosses either baseline the appropriate directional prefix shall be assigned. Directional prefixes shall not be abbreviated on recorded documents such as plats and certified survey maps. Bristol Street is the east-west baseline and Main Street is the north-south baseline. 
C.  Suffix (Roadway Type) Designations. Every roadway name shall be assigned a roadway type suffix. Suffixes shall be spelled out and not abbreviated when submitted to the roadway naming authority. The following table includes a list of allowable suffixes. No other suffixes may be used. In addition, the following table includes a description of the appropriate usage of each roadway type suffix. Allowable suffixes for private roadways shall be limited to: alley, circle, court, lane, place, square, and trail. 
Acceptable Suffix Description of Appropriate Usage Abbreviation Alley Service road providing secondary access to adjoining properties. Alley Avenue Continuous roadway not limited to a single subdivision. Avenues may be constructed with or without a landscaped median. Ave Boulevard A continuous roadway divided by a landscaped median and spans more than one subdivision. Blvd Circle A circle is a short roadway that begins and loops back to terminate on the same roadway.

A cul-de-sac that terminates a through roadway must bear the same name as the through roadway it terminates but it shall have the court suffix. In this case, it would not be considered a duplicate name per Section 15.32.040(A)(2). 
2.  Roadway Direction Changes. A roadway that changes direction one or more times shall retain the same name over the entire length within the city corporate limits. 
3.  Naming Discontinuous Roadways That Will be Aligned and May be Potentially Joined in the Future. If an existing roadway in one subdivision has a temporary end at the property or subdivision boundary line and is on the same alignment as a new roadway in another subdivision but they do not connect, the new roadway should bear the same name if future development expects to connect the two. 
4.  Limitation on Two Roadways Intersecting Each Other. Two roadways may not intersect more than once, with the exception of a circle and another roadway. 
5.  Naming When Extending an Existing Roadway. A new roadway that will be an extension of an existing roadway must be given the same name as the existing roadway. A directional prefix must be assigned if the roadway is extended to cross a base line. 
F.  Naming Private Roadways. All private roadways shall be named. Private roadways are subject to this naming standard just as public roadways are. 
G.  Roadway Signage.

D.  Property Address Numbering Grid. The city shall maintain a property address numbering grid for addresses. Addresses shall be assigned to parcels based on the location of the proper door. 
E.  Point of Origin. The center of the grid shall be the intersection of Bristol and Main streets, with all blocks adjacent to these roadways having a designation of 100. Numbers shall increase northward and southward from Main Street and eastward and westward from Bristol Street. 
F.  Even/Odd Numbers. The north side of east/west roadways and the west side of north/south roadways shall be assigned even numbers. The south side of east/west roadways and the east side of north/south roadways shall be assigned odd numbers. 
G.  Number Block. Addresses should be assigned at a rate of 400 per mile. The lowest address on the odd side of the roadway shall end in 1. The lowest address on the even side of the roadway shall end in 2. For example, 501 and 502 for the 500 block of West Main Street. 
H.  Corner Lots. Corner lots shall initially be assigned an address on both roadways. Ultimately, the official address/es should be assigned based on the location of the proper door. 
I.  Roadways Change Direction. Roadways that change direction should be addressed according to the prevailing roadway direction. The prevailing direction is based on the longest segment. In the event of a tie in length of two or more segments in different directions, the city property addressing authority will make a decision. 
J.  Diagonal Roadways. A roadway oriented on a diagonal shall be designated as an east/west or north/south roadway for addressing purposes. The designation shall be made based on the east/west distance versus north/south distance whichever is greater. Diagonal roadways shall be addressed throughout the length in a consistent manner.

2.  This chapter shall not repeal, impair or modify Wisconsin State Statutes and Administrative Codes or city ordinances, except that it shall apply whenever it imposes stricter restrictions on land use. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to regulate and control the subdivision of land within the corporate limits and extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the city in order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. They are designed to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to further the orderly layout and use of land; to insure proper legal description and proper monumenting of subdivided land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air, including access to sunlight for solar collectors; to prevent the development of noise sensitive land uses (such as homes, schools and recreational areas) adjacent to highway corridors and to ensure that any such development that does occur is planned to mitigate the adverse effects of noise; to prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, storm drainage, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public requirements; to facilitate the further resubdivision of larger parcels into smaller parcels of land. These regulations are formulated to facilitate enforcement of development standards as outlined in the building code (Chapter 15.04), zoning ordinance (Title 17), comprehensive plan and official map of the city.

Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and submit a complete application packet to the city planner, including the required number of full-size copies of the plat, copies of the plat accurately photocopied and reduced to eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches in size, a land use application form, and all other items as required per the application checklist for this type of request. The required number of copies for each item is listed on the planning department land development application form and checklist for this type of request. The plat will be scheduled for review by the plan commission per their meeting schedule. The subdivider shall also forward a copy to the local electric, gas and telephone utilities. The city planner may allow a combined filing of the preliminary plat and the final plat when it is determined that the scale and complexity of the proposal will allow for a reasonable level of review within the allocated timeline. 
B.  The preliminary plat shall cover the entire area proposed for development at the time, including rights-of-way for all adjacent roads and highways and shall be prepared in accordance with the ordinance codified in this chapter. Where a subdivider owns or controls adjacent lands in addition to those proposed for development at that time, such subdivider shall submit a conceptual plan for the development of the adjacent lands showing streets, utilities, zoning districts, and other information as may affect the review of the preliminary plat in question. 
C.  The planning department shall forward copies of the preliminary plat to city staff who shall examine it for completeness and for conformity with the requirements of the ordinance codified in this chapter and with the requirements of any other city ordinances, statutes or administrative rules and regulations, and for compliance with the city comprehensive plan including potential traffic generation and sewer flows. The preliminary plat shall be subject to the city ordinance requirements in place at the time of submittal of a complete application. A comprehensive report shall then be forwarded to the plan commission. 
D.  The plan commission shall recommend approval or conditional approval of the plat to the city council or shall reject the plat. the plan commission recommendation for the preliminary plat shall be referred to the council for consideration.

A letter and copy of the resolution as appropriate shall be returned to the subdivider, such subdivider's surveyor, or engineer with the date and action endorsed thereon; and if approved conditionally or rejected, the condition of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. A written request to extend the review time may be submitted by the subdivider to the city administrator within ninety (90) days of filing of the preliminary plat. Failure of the city council to act within the ninety (90) days or an agreed to extension thereof constitutes an automatic approval of the preliminary plat. 
E.  Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall entitle filing of the final plat. If the final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any conditions of that approval, and to local plans and ordinances adopted at the time of submittal of the complete preliminary plat application, as authorized by law, it is entitled to approval. If the final plat is not submitted within thirty-six (36) months after the last required approval of the preliminary plat, or a written request to extend the 36-month period is not submitted and approved by the city council prior to the expiration of this period, then the preliminary plat approval is void. The last approval of a preliminary plat means the date of adoption of a resolution approving or conditionally approving the preliminary plat by the city council, or, in the case of an extraterritorial plat, by either the county board, the town board, or city council, whichever occurs latest. Previous preliminary plat approvals shall not constitute grounds for approval upon resubmission. The final plat may, if permitted by the city council, constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record at that time.

No land shall be divided which has been officially mapped as public lands, stormwater management facility or is determined by the city council to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, bad drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, or unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to health, safety or welfare of future residents or landowners in the proposed land division or of the community unless actual buildable sites are outside of these mapped or sensitive areas. 
E.  In the case of any land division, lot sizes shall conform to the area and width requirements prescribed for the zoning district in which the property is located. 
F.  The above requirements shall not apply to those areas outside the corporate limits of the city and within the city's extraterritorial limits except for those areas within the city's urban service area. Areas within the urban service area of the city shall be required to connect to the Sun Prairie public water distribution and/or public sewerage system if determined by the city engineer to be feasible. If such connection(s) are not determined feasible, the proposed land division shall provide for adequate on-site systems and such special piping provisions as may be necessary to serve the anticipated development during the interim period until such Sun Prairie public water and/or sewerage systems are determined by the city engineer to be feasibly available for connection to. The subdivider, and such subdivider's heirs and assigns, shall by written plat restriction agree to abandon the interim water and sewerage facilities and connect to the Sun Prairie public water and sewerage facilities upon a determination by the city engineer that such facilities are available for feasible connection to. 
G.  The city council, in applying the provisions of this section, shall upon written request, recite the particular facts in writing upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for the proposed use. 
Chapter 16.24 - CERTIFIED SURVEY MAPS 
Sections: 

16.24.010 - Land divisions by certified survey. 
A.  A certified survey map, prepared and recorded in accordance with Section 236.34, Wisconsin Statutes, and the requirements of this title, and having been approved by the city council or designated committee or agent, may be used in lieu of a subdivision plat to divide or change the boundaries of lots, outlots or other lands previously approved by the city or other authority and recorded with the Dane County register of deeds as a subdivision plat, certified survey map, assessors plat, metes and bounds description, or other lot of record which does not alter areas previously dedicated to the public or a restriction placed on the platted land by covenant, by grant of easement, or by any other manner provided that a certified survey map of not more than four parcels of land consisting of lots or outlots, may be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the land is situated. A certified survey map may be used to change the boundaries of lots and outlots within a recorded plat, recorded assessor's plat under Section 70.27, Wisconsin Statutes, or recorded, certified survey map or other lot of record if the reconfiguration does not result in a subdivision or violate a local subdivision regulation. A certified survey map may not alter areas previously dedicated to the public or a restriction placed on the platted land by covenant, by grant of an easement, or by any other manner. A certified survey map that crosses the exterior boundary of a recorded plat or assessor's plat may be used to reconfigure fewer than five parcels by a single owner, or if no additional parcels are created. Such a certified survey map must be approved in the same manner as a final plat of a subdivision must be approved under Section 236.10, Wisconsin Statutes, must be monumented in accordance with Section 236.15(1), Wisconsin Statutes, and shall contain owners' and mortgagees' certificates that are in substantially the same form as required under Section 236.21(2)(a), Wisconsin Statutes. 
B.  The certified survey map shall be in the coordinate system and vertical datum currently specified by the city of Sun Prairie and include the entire original parcels of land owned or controlled by the subdivider and proposed for division to ensure that the remaining parcel meets all required lot, layout, access and other applicable standards hereunder. The subdivider shall comply with all requirements of this title, including Chapter 16.28 (Design Standards), Chapter 16.32 (Improvements), Chapter 17.28 (Environmental Corridor: Natural Resource Protection Regulations), and all requirements for a certified survey map of Section 236.34, Wisconsin Statutes, when a certified survey map is used. A certification of the approval of the certified survey map by the city council or the city planner if only a staff approval is necessary as provided herein, and in the extraterritorial area an owners certificate noting that the map shall be submitted to the city as a required approving authority, shall be inscribed legibly on the face of the map. A certificate of the city finance officer stating that there are no unpaid special assessments, taxes, or other past due fees on the lands shall be included on the certified survey map for lands located within the corporate boundaries of the city. 
C.  In addition to preparing the map, the subdivider shall prepare and submit two paper copies of a draft land information spreadsheet with the following fields completed for each lot and outlot in the certified survey map: property address number, roadway directional prefix, roadway name, roadway type suffix, legal description, lot square footage, proposed land use, and current zoning classification. The land division information spreadsheet is also required for certified survey maps within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
D.  The applicant for a land division shall file thirty (30) acceptable reproductions of a certified survey map, two paper copies of a draft land information spreadsheet and a written application requesting approval with the planning department along with an abstract of title certified to date of submission for approval or, at the option of the applicant, a policy of title insurance or certificate of title from an abstract company for examination in order to ascertain whether all parties in interest have signed the owner's certificate on the CSM. 
E.  The city planner shall transmit copies of the map and the draft land division information spreadsheet to the city staff, who shall review it for conformance with the provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and any applicable master plans, ordinances, official maps, statutes, rules or regulations. Upon review of the map, a complete report shall be forwarded to the plan commission, unless only a staff approval is necessary as provided herein. The plan commission may require the submittal of additional information necessary for review of the survey. 
F.  Minor Land Divisions. 
1.  The city planner is the approving authority for minor land divisions through a certified survey map. A certified survey map qualifies as a minor land division if any of the following criteria apply, as determined by the city planner: 
a.  The certified survey map will adjust a common lot line between lots, outlots, parcels or other mortgage descriptions where no new lots are created; 
b.  The certified survey map will combine one or more lots, outlots, parcels or other mortgage descriptions; or 
c.  The certified survey map will split an existing duplex home for the purpose of converting the building into a twin home, as defined by the zoning ordinance. 
d.  The certified survey map will not involve the dedication of right-of-way other than that needed to accommodate the potential widening of existing streets, does not involve lands containing environmentally sensitive features, and includes only lots that meet the minimum requirements of their respective zoning districts without the need for a variance or other relief. 
2.  In limited situations, as determined by the city planner, the dedication of public lands or easements may be accepted through a minor land division. 
3.  City staff will ensure compliance with all requirements for the submittal and complete compliance with the provisions of this title and any other applicable city ordinances and plans. Upon satisfaction of all the requirements of this section, the city planner may approve the certified survey map for the minor land division. 
4.  The city planner may refer the certified survey map to the plan commission if deemed necessary. Likewise, the applicant may appeal any decision of the city planner to the plan commission. If referred or appealed to the plan commission, the certified survey map shall be placed on the agenda within thirty (30) days of the referral, or request for appeal, for consideration by the plan commission, and shall follow the procedures outlined within this chapter for review and consideration of a certified survey map. 
G.  The plan commission shall review all other certified survey maps that are not determined as minor land divisions and shall recommend approval, conditional approval, or rejection of the map to the city council. The city council shall then approve, conditionally approve, or reject the map. One copy of the map shall be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon; and if approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. 
H.  Unless the time is extended in writing by the subdivider, failure to complete the action required herein within ninety (90) days of application, shall constitute an automatic approval of the map. Failure of the approving authority or its agent to act within the ninety (90) days, or any extension of that period, constitutes an approval of the certified survey map and, upon demand, a certificate to that effect shall be made on the face of the map by the clerk of the authority that has failed to act. 
I.  Prior to the city signing the final certified survey map for recording, the subdivider shall submit to the department of planning and economic development two paper copies and an electronic copy in a format as specified by the city the following: the final certified survey map in the coordinate system and vertical datum currently specified by the city of Sun Prairie, and the final land division information spreadsheet. 
J.  The subdivider shall record a copy of the approved certified survey map together with the approving resolution with the register of deeds for Dane County within six months after the date of the city council approval of the certified survey map. All fees shall be paid by the subdivider. 
K.  No building permits shall be issued and no improvements shall be made until the certified survey is recorded and a document recording number is filed with the building inspector. 
L.  Submittals of previously approved certified survey maps for replatting or re-approval by the city council shall be in accordance with Section 16.20.050. 
M.  A recorded copy of the certified survey map shall be provided to the city planner.

Chapter 16.28 - DESIGN STANDARDS 
Sections: 

16.28.010 - Layout requirements-General. 
    The arrangement, character, features, and layout of land divisions in the city shall be designed to comply with the standards of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the comprehensive plan, the official map, and/or any comprehensive utility plans or other planning documents which may pertain to the standards of design for land divisions and which have been adopted by the city council of the city. Where no such planning documents have been adopted, subdivisions shall be designed according to engineering and planning standards approved by the city engineer and applied so as to properly relate the proposed development with adjacent development, the topography, natural features, public safety and convenience, and the most advantageous development of undeveloped adjacent lands. 
    To avoid delays and misunderstandings during the city's review process, the developer's consultant shall list all exceptions to the city ordinances, policies and standard specifications. The list must accompany every submittal to city staff for review, beginning with the concept review stage through preliminary and final platting, and the construction document phase of the development. Failure on the part of the developer or developer's consultant to identify the exceptions will not constitute approval of said exceptions by the city. 
    Documents containing any and all exceptions discovered during the review process, up to and through to approval of the construction documents, will be revised by the developer's consultant to comply with the ordinances, policies, and standard specifications at the cost of the developer. 
16.28.020 - Streets. 
A.  Compliance with Statutes. In laying out a land division, the subdivider shall conform to the provisions of Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes, and all applicable Code sections. In all cases where the requirements of the Code section are different from the requirements of Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
B.  Dedication. The subdivider shall provide lands and street improvements for public dedication as required in this chapter. Streets shall be located with due regard for topographical conditions, natural features, existing and proposed streets, utilities and land uses and public convenience and safety. Streets shall conform substantially to the official map of the city. In the absence of a street being shown on the official map, streets shall be provided in locations determined necessary by the city engineer and to the right-of-way widths required in this chapter for the classification of street required. 
C.  Minimum Lot Frontage. 
1.  All lots shall conform to minimum lot area and width as required by the zoning ordinance provided that no lot has less than a minimum of forty-five (45) feet of platted frontage on a public street to allow access by emergency and service motor vehicles or as permitted through a planned commercial site (refer to Section 16.04.020, Definitions). 
2.  Such frontage shall be provided either by: 
a.  A platted public street; or 
b.  For residential dwelling units only, a private common driveway approved as a conditional use per Section 17.44.050. 
i.  The private common driveway may serve no more than five residential lots. Such private driveway ending in a dead end shall be subject to the regulations pertaining to cul-de-sac streets outlined within this chapter. 
ii.  The pavement width of the private common driveway shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) feet wide; shall not permit parking or storage unless provisions are made to accommodate such parking or storage; and shall be designated as, and clearly signed as, a fire lane. 
iii.  The private common driveway must serve as the primary access for more than one lot. Private common driveways will not be considered solely for the purpose of creating access so that one lot may be created. 
iv.  The private common driveway shall be located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the edge of any other driveway at the access point to a public street. 
v.  All attached and detached single-family dwelling units served by such a private common driveway shall provide a minimum of four on-lot parking spaces. All multifamily dwellings served by such a private common driveway shall provide the minimum required parking spaces on the individual lots as required for those particular uses as specified by the zoning ordinance. 
vi.  Private common driveways shall be commonly owned and maintained by a property owners' association with explicit city-approved common maintenance and access provisions. 
c.  Planned commercial site. Lots in an approved planned commercial site for which an approved specific implementation plan has been recorded, including access to a public street by means and under conditions acceptable to the city, may be included in a subdivision or land division with such access subject to the review and approval standards for land divisions outlined within this chapter. Lots within a planned commercial site shall not be required to meet the dimensions or sizes required by the zoning ordinance (also refer to Section 16.04.020, Definitions). 
3.  Alley frontage (public or private) shall not constitute meeting this minimum frontage requirement. 
D.  Compliance with City Planning Documents. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the city comprehensive plan, the official map, and to this chapter, and other city planning documents and shall be considered in their relation to: existing and planned streets, reasonable circulation of traffic, topographical conditions, runoff of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation at the same or greater width of the existing streets in adjoining areas. 
E.  Areas or Facilities Not Covered by City Planning Documents. In areas not covered by the comprehensive plan, or official map, the layout of streets shall conform to the plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas of the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and officially planned streets, topography and natural terrain, streams and lakes, and existing tree growth, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. 
F.  Street Classifications. Streets shall be required and classified in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan and official map by the city engineer prior to preliminary plat approval and where not identified in such plan and map, in accordance with sound engineering standards, into the classifications indicated below. 
1.  Arterial Streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide through traffic for a heavy volume of vehicles (>12,000 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) typical). 
2.  Collector Streets. Collector streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic from individual areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major streets into which they feed (3,000-12,000 ADT typical). 
3.  Local Streets. Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property (<3,000 ADT typical). 
4.  Alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way width of thirty (30) feet and shall have a minimum pavement width of fourteen (14) feet. The minimum curb return radii for alleys at street intersections shall be ten (10) feet. Alleys shall be constructed to meet the pavement design requirements of Section 16.32.070 B.1. Any variations from the pavement design requirements must have prior approval of the city engineer. Alleys shall only be allowed along rear or side lot lines. The maximum driveway width shall be twenty-four (24) feet for lots that take access to alleys. Public utilities may be located within alley rights-of-way only if approved by the city engineer. 
5.  Reserve Strips. Reserve strips of land shall not be permitted on any plat to control access to streets or alleys. Access shall be controlled by plat restriction statements and The Access Management Guidelines. 
6.  Private Drives. Standards for private drives shall conform to those for local streets except as specifically altered by this chapter. They shall be subject to public use by emergency service vehicles and shall provide for common access as specifically provided for in a joint access agreement. 
G.  Extraterritorial Streets. Streets located in the extraterritorial plat jurisdiction of the city shall provide for the dedication or reservation of the minimum widths of right-of-way in accordance with the city of Sun Prairie official map-ETJ area. Extraterritorial streets within the urban service area shall be provided to the structural standards of Section 16.32.070 B., and minimum pavement widths of twenty-four (24) feet and without curb and gutter. Other streets within the extraterritorial plat jurisdiction of the city shall meet or exceed the town road standards of Section 86.26, Wisconsin Statutes. 
H.  Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for continuation wherever topographic and other physical conditions permit. The use of cul-de-sacs shall be held to a minimum and permanently dead-ended streets shall be prohibited. Provisions shall be made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct connection with, or be continuous and in line with, existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions as determined by the city that such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the land division with existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Temporary dead-end streets shall not be over seven hundred fifty (750) feet in total length, shall provide for an eventual intersection spacing meeting the requirements of Section 16.28.020 P., and shall provide for temporary cul-de-sacs or turnarounds as approved by the city engineer when exceeding a depth of two residential lots on either side of the street or one hundred fifty (150) feet, whichever is less. 
I.  Minor (Local) Streets. Minor (local) streets shall be so designed to discourage through traffic. 
J.  Frontage Roads. Where a land division abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial highway, or railroad right-of-way, the subdivider shall provide a frontage road, platted access restriction along the property contiguous to such highway, or such other treatment as may be determined necessary by the city engineer to ensure safe, efficient traffic flow and/or adequate protection of residential properties. 
K.  Horizontal Curves. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than five degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than one hundred fifty (150) feet on local streets, two hundred fifty (250) feet on collector streets, and four hundred fifty (450) feet on arterial streets as measured at the right-of-way centerline, unless approved by the city engineer. 
L.  Private Streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall public improvements be approved for any private street; all streets shall be dedicated for public use, except private drives approved through a conditional use or planned development (see Section 17.44.050 of the zoning ordinance). 
M.  Visibility. Streets shall afford maximum visibility and safety for motorist, bicycle, and pedestrian use and shall intersect at right angles, where practicable. A minimum sight distance with clear visibility, measured along the centerline, shall meet or exceed the requirements as set forth by the current edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, and other pertinent standards of regulatory agencies with a common interest. 
N.  Vertical Curves. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves that meet or exceed the requirements as set forth by the current edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, and other pertinent standards of regulatory agencies with a common interest. The minimum vertical length in feet shall be the equivalent to thirty (30) times the algebraic difference in grade for all streets. 
O.  Half Streets. Half streets shall not be platted unless necessary to provide the full width of an existing street platted to half width. All newly platted streets shall be platted to the required full width. Where a half street exists adjacent to a proposed land division, the subdivider shall endeavor to acquire and dedicate the remaining half street. 
P.  Intersections. 
1.  Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. The curved street shall intersect another street with not less than fifteen (15) feet of tangent right-of-way between the end of curvature and the right-of-way of the street being intersected. 
2.  The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be not more than two. 
3.  The number of intersections along arterial streets shall be held to a minimum. The distance between such intersections shall not be less than twelve hundred (1,200) feet unless determined by the city engineer to provide safety to motorists. 
4.  Right-of-way lines at intersections with collector and arterial streets shall be rounded with a minimum radius of twenty-five (25) feet unless the city engineer determines a larger radius is necessary. 
5.  Local streets shall continue directly across arterial or collector streets. The center lines of minor streets which approach the major streets from opposite sides thereof within three hundred (300) feet of each other, measured along the center line of the arterial or collector street shall be adjusted so that the alignment across the arterial or collector street is continuous and a jog is avoided. 
6.  Local streets and frontage roads intersecting with other local streets or collector streets shall, wherever practicable, be spaced no closer than one hundred fifty (150) feet between right-of-way lines of a local street, nor closer than two hundred fifty (250) feet to the right-of-way of a collector street and three hundred (300) feet with an arterial street. 

Local Streets and Frontage Roads 
7.  Local streets, frontage roads and collector streets intersecting with arterial streets shall, wherever practicable, be spaced no closer than five hundred (500) feet between right-of-way lines. 

Local Streets, Frontage Roads and Collector Streets 
8.  Cul-de-sac streets shall be designed to have one end permanently closed and shall not exceed seven hundred fifty (750) feet in length from center line of the intersecting street to center of cul-de-sac in CR-5ac, ER-1, SR-4 and MR-8 zoning districts and shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet in length measured as above in other zoning districts. In all cul-de-sacs, there shall be an unobstructed sight distance from the intersection of the intersecting street to the far end of the cul-de-sac bulb. 
9.  The city engineer may require restricted development easements or additional street rights-of-way to be platted at any intersection where the city engineer deems it to be necessary in order to provide adequate site distances for motorists. At a minimum, the subdivider shall grade, clear, or otherwise provide for an unobstructed departure sight distance along the major roadway of two hundred eighty (280) feet for a stopped passenger car. The minor road vertex (decision point) is eighteen (18) feet from the major road traveled way. This distance is for a design speed of twenty-five (25) miles per hour and for left turns onto a two-lane street with no median and grades three percent (3%) or less. For other conditions the distance must be adjusted and may require additional sight distance. 
Q.  Alleys. 
1.  Alleys or alleyway easements may be provided in all residential, commercial, industrial, office and planned development zoning districts. Such alleys or alleyway easements shall be privately owned and maintained and shall not connect to arterial thoroughfares. Prior to approval, a joint use alley or alleyway easement agreement shall be submitted and approved by the city engineer and city attorney. No parking shall be allowed within the fourteen-foot-wide paved area of alleys. 
2.  Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited. 
R.  Street Names. New roadway names shall be proposed by the subdivider in accordance with the roadway naming standards in Chapter 15.32. The roadway naming authority will review the proposed roadway names for compliance with the roadway naming standards. The Sun Prairie public safety communications center, the fire department, and emergency medical services will review the roadway names to ensure there are no conflicting names in their service areas. The roadway names on new plats will ultimately be approved by the city council through plat approval. 
16.28.030 - Blocks. 
A.  Length-Arrangement. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate for the topography and the type of development contemplated, but block length (measured in the long dimension from street centerline to street centerline) shall not be less than five hundred (500) feet nor exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet nor have less than sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth between street lines. Blocks shall be so designated as to provide two tiers of lots, unless it adjoins a railroad, major thoroughfare, waterway, environmental corridor or park where it may have a single tier of lots. Cul-de-sacs may be used where the interblock spacing of adjacent streets exceeds the appropriate depth of two tiers of lots. 
B.  Pedestrian Easements. Pedestrian easements may be required by the city council, upon the recommendation of the plan commission, through the center of a block more than nine hundred (900) feet long, and/or where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities. 
C.  Street Tree Planting Strip Easements. Tree planting easements shall be provided for on both sides of all streets when the street terrace is insufficient. The minimum easement width shall be ten (10) feet and shall be adjacent to the front property line. Street trees shall be maintained by the adjacent property owner in accordance with city ordinances. 
16.28.040 - Lots. 
A.  Size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location and topography of the land division and for the type of development contemplated, provided that no lot shall be smaller in area than the minimum lot size for the appropriate zone as established by the zoning ordinance. 
B.  Lot dimensions, shape, and size shall provide for conformance to the requirements of the zoning ordinance for the proposed land use(s) without the need for the granting of zoning ordinance variances by the board of zoning appeals. 
C.  Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit building setback from both streets, as required by the zoning ordinance. 
D.  Every lot shall abut a public or private drive, except as permitted within a planned commercial site (see Section 16.04.020, Definitions). 
E.  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to or radial to abutting street lines. 
F.  In case a tract is divided and results in parcels of more than twice the minimum lot size provided for by the zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the land is located, such parcels shall be so arranged to permit redividing into parcels in accordance with this chapter and with the zoning ordinance without the necessity for a variance from the board of zoning appeals. 
G.  Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be prohibited except where determined to be necessary by the city engineer, to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
H.  Lots abutting upon wetlands, shorelands, watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall have such additional depth or width, as required by the city engineer to obtain building sites that are not subject to flooding from a post development 100-year storm. The encroachment limits and elevation of the 100-year post-development storm event shall be identified on the final plat. 
I.  Land divisions shall be designed so as to protect natural features included, but not limited to, tree growth, watercourses, historic places, or similar conditions. 
J.  No parcels containing less area than area required by the particular zoning district shall be created by a land division, except as permitted within a planned commercial site (see Section 16.04.020, Definitions). 
K.  In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a limited access highway or other arterials, there shall be no new direct vehicular access from individual lots to such streets and roads and such restriction shall be noted on the land division. In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on limited access highways or other arterials where there is no other alternative, a temporary entrance may be granted by the controlling authority. As neighboring land is subdivided permanent access conforming to the requirements of this chapter and the zoning ordinance shall be provided. At that time, temporary access points permitted under this section shall be closed. 
L.  Lots containing pedestrian or drainage easements shall be platted to include additional width in allowance for the easement unless otherwise approved by the city engineer or city planner. 
16.28.050 - Water supply and sewage disposal. 
A.  Water Supply. Extensions of the public water supply system shall be designed so as to provide public water service to each lot and required fire flow protection to each hydrant continuous from property line to property line. 
B.  Sewage Disposal. Where public sanitary sewers of adequate capacity are determined by the city engineer to be available, extensions of the public sanitary sewer system shall be made so as to provide sewer service to each lot. Gravity sanitary sewers shall be extended to the subdivision and to each buildable lot in accordance with the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive sanitary sewer plan as determined by the city engineer. 
C.  Service Location Markings. The ends of the services for each lot shall be accurately measured and recorded with the wastewater treatment plant and the water and light commission and marked in the field with appropriate staking. The top of curb shall be stamped with an "S" and "W" at the sanitary sewer and water services, respectively. 
16.28.060 - Surface water. 
A.  Drainage System Required. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the land division and the drainage area of which it is a part. A final plat shall be approved contingent on the subdivider submitting plans, profiles and specifications for a drainage system in the subdivision phase under development and being consistent with the city's stormwater management plan, and as specified in this section, and which have been prepared by a registered professional engineer, and which have been reviewed by and modified to the satisfaction of the city engineer. 
B.  Drainage System Requirements. The subdivider shall install all storm drainage facilities as required in Chapter 16.32 necessary to serve, and resulting from, the phase of the subdivision under development: 
1.  Street Drainage. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm collection system. The street system shall serve as the minor collection system and shall be designed to carry stormwater drainage from streets, adjacent land and buildings. Stormwater shall not be permitted to be run into the sanitary sewer at any time. Refer to Section 16.32.110 for additional information. 
2.  Off-Street Drainage. The design of the major drainage system shall include drainage facilities for the entire watershed affecting the land division and shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage. When the drainage system is outside of the street right-of-way, the subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating an easement to the city to provide for the future access and maintenance of such system. Easements shall be provided in accordance with Section 16.28.070 B. 
3.  Drainage Swales. The drainage area for all drainage swales that flow over bike paths and sidewalks shall not exceed an area of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. Provisions shall be made to collect water prior to crossing any sidewalk or bike path. 
C.  Protection of Drainage System. The subdivider shall protect all conveyance systems to the satisfaction of the city engineer and in accordance with Section 16.32.110 of this title. Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded or paved depending upon grades and soil types, and as determined by the city engineer. Storm inlets shall be protected by installing "catch-all" inlet devices or equal as determined by the city engineer. 
16.28.070 - Easements. 
A.  Utility Easements. The city council, on the recommendation of the plan commission and other appropriate departments of the city shall require utility easements for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, and water mains or other utility lines. It is the intent of this section to protect all established easements so as to assure proper grade, assure maintenance of the established grade, prohibit construction of permanent structures or retaining walls over underground installation and prohibit the planting of trees in the easement area. 
B.  Drainage Easements. Where a land division is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream: 
1.  There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this section; or 
2.  The watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be assured and the same provided with a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to comply with this section; or 
3.  Wherever possible, drainage shall be maintained in an easement by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. In all cases, such easements shall be of a minimum width established at the high water mark, or in the absence of such specification, not less than twenty (20) feet. 
C.  Pedestrian Easements. Pedestrian easements shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide and surfaced as required by the city council. 
D.  Easement Locations. Easements shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide and shall run alongside lot lines whenever possible, but may run across lots. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider that easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated in the plat or in deeds that have been approved by the individual utility companies or the organization responsible for furnishing the services involved. 
16.28.080 - Grading. 
    Grading shall not be allowed on the land development until the land division development agreement is approved, or until the subdivider receives an erosion control permit, provides an insurance certificate, all required regulatory permits and surety covering the intended work. Grading operations occurring prior to the plat being recorded and construction plan approval shall be performed at the subdivider's risk. The subdivider shall grade each land division in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to topography as follows: 
A.  The subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all proposed streets in accordance with the approved plans, including the grading of sight triangles at each intersection in accordance with Section 16.28.020 P.8. 
B.  Block grading shall be completed by one or more of the following methods: 
1.  Regrading along the side or rear lot lines which provides for drainage to the public drainage facilities; 
2.  Parts of all lots may be graded to provide for drainage to a ditch or to a swale, provided any ditches or swales are in public drainage easements; 
3.  Draining across rear or side lot lines may be permitted provided that the course of drainage is within a public drainage easement and is toward public drainage facilities. 
C.  Lot grading shall be completed so that water drains away from each building site toward public drainage facilities at a minimum grade of two percent (2%) so that the lowest point of the building foundation opening fronting the street is a minimum of two feet above the lowest point of the adjacent curb or as approved by the city engineer and the building inspector. Provisions shall be made to prevent drainage onto properties adjacent to the land division unless to a public drainage facility. 
D.  Grading activities shall not result in slopes greater than 4:1 on public lands. Slopes within privately owned and maintained stormwater facilities shall not be greater than required by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Conservation Practice Standard. 
E.  The topsoil stripped for grading shall not be removed from the site unless identified in the erosion control plan approved by the city engineer as not being necessary for erosion control or site landscaping purposes. Topsoil shall be uniformly returned to the lots when rough grading is finished. Topsoil piles shall be leveled and seeded for erosion control prior to the city releasing the one year guarantee provision on public improvements in the streets adjacent to the lots on which the topsoil is stockpiled. 
F.  Such grading shall not result in detriment to any existing developed lands either within or outside of the corporate limits. 
(Ord. 503, § 1, 8-21-2012) 
16.28.090 - Public lands and open spaces. 
A.  Purpose. The requirements of this subsection are established to insure that adequate parks, open spaces and sites for other public uses are properly located and preserved as the city grows. It has also been established to insure that the cost of providing the park and recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional people brought into the community by land development may be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs created by the development. The requirements shall apply to all lands proposed for all residential development. Reconfiguration of existing lots which does not create new, additional lots shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. 
B.  Design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, or development project, provision shall be made for suitable sites of adequate area for schools, parks, playgrounds, open spaces, drainageways and other public purposes. Such sites as are shown on the official map and the parks and open space plan element of the comprehensive plan, shall be made a part of the design. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds and ravines and woodland, prairie and wetland plant and animal communities. The park shall be improved with the necessary public improvements required in Section 16.32.010. 
C.  Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate sufficient developable land area for the park, recreation and open space needs of the development, that is suitable and readily developable to provide adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs to be created by and to be provided for a subdivision or land division project in accordance with standards outlined in the parks and open space plan. The minimum dedication shall be at the rate of one acre for each twenty-three (23) proposed dwelling units or portion thereof. Any adjustments or changes in the number of units before issuance of a building permit will be subject to this section. All parkland accepted shall be a minimum of two acres in size. Each park shall have at least two frontages on public streets, with at least one frontage of at least two hundred (200) feet in width on a public street and the other entrance a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet in width on a public street. No perimeter dimension of the park shall be less than two hundred (200) feet. The parks and recreation commission shall have the authority to recommend alternative dimensions for frontages and the park if it can be found that the objectives of access and visibility can be fulfilled. 
D.  Public Park Fees. 
1.  Fee in Lieu of Dedication. Where, in the discretion of the plan commission and the parks and recreation commission, there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed land division or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the city's comprehensive development plan or the parks and recreation commission determines that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the plan commission and parks and recreation commission may recommend to the committee of the whole that the subdivider pay a fee in lieu of making the required land dedication. The amount of any fee imposed shall be determined as follows: For each proposed development, the fee shall be the current rate as established by the common council for each dwelling unit. Any adjustment or changes in the number of dwelling units before final plat acceptance will be subject to this section. 
2.  Dedication and Fee. 
a.  The plan commission and the parks and recreation commission may recommend the subdivider satisfy the requirements by combining land dedication with fee payments. The fee, in such cases, shall be determined by subtracting the credited value of the dedicated land, from the total fee which would have been imposed had no land been dedicated by the subdivider. 
b.  Payment may be made by one of the following methods: 
i.  Option A-Lump Sum. A lump sum amount shall be paid prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development; or 
ii.  Option B-Payment of One-Third of All Land Dedication and Fee Payments. The subdivider shall pay the city thirty-three and four-tenths percent (33.4%) of the total fee by the date the first building permit is issued. At such time that thirty-three and four-tenths percent (33.4%) of the building permits are issued for the approved development or after one year from the date that the city issued the first building permit, whichever occurs first, the subdivider shall pay the second installment of thirty-three and three-tenths percent (33.3%) of the total fee. At such time that sixty-six and seven-tenths percent (66.7%) of the building permits are issued for the approved development or after two years from the date that the city issued the first building permit, whichever occurs first, the subdivider shall pay the final installment of thirty-three and three-tenths percent (33.3%) of the total fee. If this method of payment is used, the outstanding balance after the first payment is made shall be charged the interest rate earned by the park trust fund for the period of time that the second and third installments are outstanding. 
c.  Subdividers shall make the lump sum payment identified in Option A above under the following circumstances: The development is less than twenty-five (25) dwelling units. 
d.  Failure to make the proper payments as defined above shall result in the immediate withholding of all building and occupancy permits until all delinquent payments are made to the city. 
3.  Additional Fee-Assessment Per Unit. In addition, at the time a building permit is issued for new construction of a single unit or multifamily units, a one-time fee per dwelling unit will be assessed for park development as established by the common council. These fees shall be placed in the park fund for park development. 
4.  Use of Fees Paid. The city shall place the fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in the park trust fund for land acquisition and park development. 
5.  Annual Fee Adjustment. All fees in these sections shall be annually adjusted by the city administrator by adding to the base fees the construction cost index (CCI), for the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, on March 1st of each year. 
Chapter 16.32 - IMPROVEMENTS 
Sections: 

16.32.010 - Required public improvements and standards-General. 
    In accordance with the authority granted by Section 236.13, Wisconsin Statutes, the city council requires that, as a condition of final plat or certified survey approval, the subdivider agrees to make and install all public improvements, as required by the ordinance codified in this chapter and as determined to be reasonably necessary by the city engineer. The plat may be developed in phases as approved by the city council. 
    In addition, the subdivider shall provide the city with acceptable surety to ensure that the subdivider installs the required public improvements. If the subdivider's project will be constructed in phases, the amount of any surety bond or other security required by the city council shall be limited to the phase of the project that is currently being constructed. The city council may not require that the subdivider provide any security for improvements sooner than is reasonably necessary before the commencement of the installation of the improvements. The subdivider shall also be responsible for paying all costs involved in required extensions and/or alterations of existing utilities which, by virtue of the platting or certified survey map are located within the public right-of-way, including public easements. The city may require the subdivider to provide acceptable surety for the installation of private streets, alleys, or other private improvements associated with a particular phase of development that are represented by the subdivider as being part of their development proposal, or that are intended for the common benefit of future residents, tenants, and landowners within the plat, as approved by the city council. 
A.  Survey Monumentation. Before final approval of any improvement of any phase of the plat or certified survey within the corporate limits of the city the subdivider shall install monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes, or as may be required by the city engineer. All survey monumentation located adjacent to street or public rights-of-way, but not located within street pavement, shall be protected with steel fence posts erected near the survey monumentation. The city engineer may waive the placing of monuments for a reasonable time during public improvement construction on condition that the subdivider executes a surety to insure the placing of such monuments within the time required. On behalf of the city, the city finance officer is authorized to accept such surety bonds and contracts for monumentation in an amount approved by the city engineer. Building permits shall not be issued until all survey monumentation for the block(s) of lots in which the lot(s) for which building permits are being applied for within the phase of the land division under development has been installed. When the land division includes a 1/2, 1/4, 1/4-1/4, or other such section monument, the monument shall be preserved, fully restored, and/or reset by the subdivider at such subdivider's cost. 
B.  City Acceptance of Dedicated Public Rights-of-Way. As a condition for the acceptance of the dedication of public rights-of-way, the city shall require that all publicly dedicated rights-of-way identified on the plat or certified survey map shall have installed all of the required public improvements as required by this chapter, including, but not limited to, sewerage, storm drainage, water mains and services, grading, electrical and gas mains and services, grading and improvement to the streets and other public ways, sidewalk, street signing, street lighting, traffic control and such other facilities required by the city council and set forth in the approval of the final plat of subdivision or certified survey map. 
(Ord. 445, § 7, 11-2-2010) 
16.32.020 - Subdivider to install improvements. 
    All required public improvements shall be installed by the subdivider at such subdivider's cost. When certain development fees are required prior to development, or when determined necessary by the city council, the subdivider shall be required to enter into a general development agreement in a form provided by the city, prior to the recording of the plat or certified survey map. Among other things, the general development agreement shall include a phasing schedule formulated by the developer and agreed to by the city for all future phases necessary to complete the plat. The subdivider shall agree in the general development agreement to install the required public improvements in accordance with the most current engineering standards and specifications which have been adopted by the city council. Where standards and/or specifications have not been adopted the improvements shall be made in accordance with established engineering practices as designated and approved by the city engineer. 
A.  Detailed Development Agreement. The subdivider shall be required to enter into a detailed development agreement for the entire plat or any phase of a phased plat with the city for land division improvements agreeing to install improvements as herein provided before construction of any improvements and before issuance of any building permit within the plat or applicable. The agreement form shall be provided by the city and may provide for a phasing of public improvements construction, providing such phasing is approved by the city council. 
1.  The city reserves the right to control the phasing through limits, sequence, and/or additional surety so as to provide for continuity of streets, sewers, water mains, and other necessary public improvements within and between the phases. 
2.  The city may place limits on the number of housing units that are allowed for construction per year based upon the provisions of the development phasing plan. 
3.  The city engineer shall review and approve the construction plans, specifications and calculations for the construction of the required public improvements and shall provide a proposed development agreement to the city council for consideration within sixty (60) days of the filing of the necessary materials by the developer. 
B.  Security. The subdivider shall file with such detailed development agreement a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to one hundred twenty (120) percent of the estimate of the cost approved by the city engineer as surety to guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or such subdivider's contractors not later than fourteen (14) months after the date the public improvements for which security is provided have been substantially complete. However, the subdivider may elect, with the approval of the city, to install the improvements in construction phases provided that: the phases are specified in the detailed development agreement for land division improvements; that the developer submits security in an amount equal to one hundred twenty (120) percent of the estimate approved by the city engineer sufficient for the construction of all phases of construction and park improvement in progress; that the developer records deed restrictions approved by the city attorney which specify that the lots which are included in future construction phases of the land division will not be transferred or sold unless the city's approval is obtained; that the subdivider minimize grading and other disturbances to lands included in future construction phases in order to prevent erosion and that erosion control plans and measures submitted and approved herein shall address the individual phases of construction. The time limit for completion of phased improvement program shall take into account the needs and desires of the city and adjacent property owners for street and other improvements to serve lands adjacent to and within the land division. As work progresses on installation of improvements constructed as part of the detailed development agreement, the city engineer, upon written request from the subdivider from time to time, is authorized to recommend a reduction in the amount of surety as hereinafter provided. When portions of construction (water, sanitary sewer, street, sidewalk, greenway or other improvements) are completed by the subdivider, and determined acceptable by the city engineer, the city administrator is authorized, upon submission of lien waivers and affidavits by the subdivider's contractors, to reduce the amount of surety. The amount of surety remaining shall be equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimate of the city engineer of costs of work remaining to be completed and accepted. When the work on the major components of construction has been substantially completed except for work which cannot be completed because of weather conditions or other reasons which in the judgment of the city engineer are valid for noncompletion, the finance officer is authorized to accept a reduction in the amount of surety to an amount in the estimate of the city engineer, sufficient to cover the work remaining to be completed. As a further guarantee that all obligations under contract for work on the development are satisfied, the contractor and subcontractors who are to be engaged in the construction of utilities or street improvements on the street right-of-way to be dedicated shall be approved for such work by the city engineer prior to commencing construction. 
C.  Improvement Guarantee. The subdivider shall include in such detailed development agreement an instrument of public improvement guarantee by personal guarantee, thereby guaranteeing maintenance, repair, replacement by the developer of such public improvements which deteriorate or fail to meet performance or operating standards within one year of completing, or acceptance by the city, whichever is later, or as otherwise provided in the detailed development agreement, and payment of any penalties which may be incurred as a result thereof, equal to fifteen (15) percent of the city engineer's estimate of the cost of the public improvements. If within one year after the date of final acceptance of any public improvement by the city council (or such longer period of time as may be prescribed by laws or regulations or by the terms of any special guarantee required by the terms of such detailed development agreement as may be necessary due to the phasing of the construction of public improvements), any work on any public improvement is found to be defective, the subdivider shall remove it and replace it with nondefective work in accordance with written instructions given by the city engineer. If the subdivider does not promptly comply with the terms of such instructions, or in an emergency where delay would cause serious risk of loss or damage, the city may cause the removal and replacement of such defective work and charge all direct, indirect and consequential costs of such removal and replacement to the subdivider. 
D.  The subdivider is responsible for requesting in writing for acceptance of the improvements and to start the one-year guarantee period when the improvements are completed. All improvements with the exception of the binder course of asphalt shall be guaranteed for one year. The binder course of asphalt shall be guaranteed until the surface course of asphalt is placed, at which point in time the one-year guarantee will begin for the surface course of asphalt. The subdivider is responsible for requesting in writing for a one-year guarantee inspection to relieve the subdivider of maintenance of any improvements deemed defective after one year and to release the instrument of surety. 
E.  Designated Projects Manager. The subdivider shall designate a project manager who shall be readily available on the project site during the construction of the required public improvements. The project manager shall be granted authority on behalf of the subdivider to make decisions related to the construction of the required public improvements as they may arise during the course of the construction. The project manager shall also be responsible for the scheduling and coordination of the required work to construct the required improvements. Correspondence with, or verbal orders to the designated project manager shall have the same authority as with the subdivider directly. 
(Ord. 640, § 1, 4-19-2016; Ord. 555, § 1, 1-10-2014) 
16.32.030 - Reserved for future use. 
16.32.040 - Extra-sized and off-site facilities. 
    In order to serve future developments, the city may require proposed developments to provide utilities that are oversized and installed to depths beyond that required to serve the proposed development. The city will require developments to install water mains up to twelve (12) inches in diameter without additional cost to the utility owner. Sanitary sewers shall be installed to diameters up to twelve (12) inches and to depths of sixteen (16) feet (as measured from the finished grade to the pipe invert) without additional cost to the utility owner. 
A.  The city shall pay the developer for the cost of additional depth when the request for additional depth results in the following additional costs to the developer: 
1.  When the sanitary sewer depth to serve the development plus five feet exceeds sixteen (16) feet in depth as measured to the invert. 
2.  When the developer can demonstrate that the additional depth will encounter rock or water conditions that would not have been encountered at the depth required to serve the development. 
3.  Storm sewers, storm channels, retention and detention facilities will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. As a general rule, the developer will be allowed to recover costs for extra/oversize. 
4.  The city may also require and may pay for extra, oversize (except streets), overdepth and off-site improvements to accommodate future development. 
B.  The developer will not be compensated for additional depth under the following conditions: 
1.  Sanitary sewers extended to the perimeter of the proposed land division at minimum grade and when the depth is equal to or less than sixteen (16) feet in total depth as measured to the invert. Sewers may not be laid at greater than minimum grade unless approved by the city engineer. 
2.  If the depth required in order to provide service to the development exceeds sixteen (16) feet. 
3.  Storm sewers extended to the perimeter of the proposed land division at minimum grade and when the depth is equal to or less than ten (10) feet as measured to the invert. 
C.  The developer at no additional cost to the city or upstream development shall install sanitary sewers up to and including twelve (12) inches in diameter. 
D.  The developer at no additional cost to the water and light commission or upstream development shall install water main up to and including twelve (12) inches in diameter. 
E.  When any public improvements of adequate capacity are not available at the boundary of proposed land division, the city, or its duly authorized representative, shall require, as a prerequisite to approval of a final plat or certified survey, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided as follows in accordance with the following sections: 
1.  Design Capacity. All improvements within or entering or leaving the proposed development shall be installed to satisfy the service requirements for the entire service or drainage area in which the development is located and the improvements shall be of sufficient capacity to handle the expected development of the overall service area involved. 
2.  Lift Stations. Where sanitary or storm sewer lift stations and force mains are required to lift sewerage to the gravity system, the subdivider shall have plans, profiles, specifications, and estimated operation and maintenance costs prepared for the installation of such facilities to the city engineer's requirements. Equipment similar to existing city equipment shall be utilized whenever possible. The installation, inspection, supervision, and engineering fees for lift stations and/or force mains shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise determined and agreed upon by the city council. Gravity sanitary sewer service shall be employed whenever determined by the city engineer to be feasibly accessible. 
16.32.050 - Site grading. 
A.  The subdivider shall be required to grade the full land division in accordance with the requirements of Section 16.28.080. Prior to receiving acceptance of the public improvements, the subdivider shall submit for approval a master grading map for the limits of the land division phase of development. This map shall show the design spot elevations at all lot corners, break points, and low points. Both an electronic copy and hard copy of this map shall be submitted in a format acceptable to the engineering department. 
B.  Grading of the site may commence after a developer's agreement has been approved and signed by all pertinent parties. If the subdivider wishes to commence with land disturbance activities prior to the finalization of the developer's agreement the subdivider must receive an approved erosion control permit and all required regulatory permits. Surety in an amount acceptable to the city engineer shall be submitted along with an insurance certificate acceptable to the city's finance department prior to the commencement of any land disturbance activities. Grading shall not be allowed on the land development until the land division development agreement is approved, or until the subdivider receives an erosion control permit, provides an insurance certificate, all required regulatory permits and surety covering the intended work. Grading operations occurring prior to the plat being recorded and construction plan approval shall be performed at the subdivider's risk. 
16.32.060 - Recapture agreement. 
    The city may at the discretion of the city council enter into a written recapture agreement with the subdivider which provides for the recapture costs of public improvements from those properties benefiting from the improvements. The recapture agreement shall prohibit development on those properties until payment has been made. The subdivider may contract directly with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversized and/or off-site improvements constructed. 
    Such recapture agreement shall provide that the subdivider be reimbursed for those oversized improvements constructed within the proposed land division, but which are oversized to serve lands beyond the boundaries of the land division or other lands within the subdivider's control. Such reimbursement shall be only for the actual additional cost of constructing the oversized improvements within the boundaries of the land division and shall not provide for payment of any interest. Only land divisions within Phase I of the staged development plan for public facilities (Map 13-3) identified in the city's comprehensive development plan are eligible to proceed under this provision. 
16.32.070 - Streets. 
A.  Grading. The subdivider shall be required to grade the full width of right-of-way of all roadways, alleys, pedestrian and/or bike paths, access easements, and other public ways required to be improved as a result of the platting whether or not such public ways are within the boundaries of the plat. Such grading shall be made to the required grade and cross section and of the street, and of materials approved by the city engineer. 
B.  Roadways. The subdivider shall be required to provide improved roadways to meet the following criteria for each street classification:

**  Widths of pavement are back to back with 30-inch C&G in typical roadway and right-of-way sections except that the minimum pavement widths for local residential streets and local residential high density streets shall be measured from the back of curb to back of curb; additional widths for pavement and right-of-way may be required at intersections or in other locations when determined by the city engineer. 
    Required right-of-way width and pavement width may be increased above the minimum standards or reduced below the minimum standards when deemed appropriate by the city engineer. Appropriateness shall be determined based on criteria including, but not limited to, the reduction of environmental impacts due to runoff from impervious cover, the need to calm traffic, and reduced long-term costs for street construction, reconstruction, and long-term maintenance. 
1.  Pavement Designs. The subdivider shall submit to the city engineer for review, alternative bituminous street pavement designs based upon the AASHTO structural number design method (interim guide) and shall include consideration of construction year and design year anticipated traffic loads, soils support values, a 20-year design life, a minimum bituminous pavement serviceability index of 2.5, and a regional factor of 3.0, and summarized as follows: 
SN = a1D1 + a2D2 + a3D3 + .... 
Where 
a = the coeff for each structural material layer 
D = the final design thickness of each structural material layer (in inches) 
Chemical stabilizations will not be considered in the pavement design calculations. The coefficients for geotextile fabrics shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the manufacturer's published values when used in the design calculations.

Prior to the commencement of any street construction, the subdivider shall notify the city engineer, at least one workday in advance as to the nature of the work being done. 
All subgrade material shall have a minimum California Bearing Ration (CBR) of 5. Subgrade material having a CBR less than 5 shall be removed and replaced with a suitable fill material, or the pavement must be designed to compensate for the soil conditions. The soil support CBR values selected for use by the designer should represent a minimum value for the soil to be used. 
The minimum total bituminous pavement thickness shall be three inches (one and three-fourths inches of binder and one and one-fourth inches of surface). The placement of bituminous asphalt pavement shall follow the guidelines outlined in the city's two-phase approach to street building which delays the placement of the surface layer for approximately two years. Natural gas mains proposed for installation in the street rights-of-way shall be installed prior to placement of the surface paving. The minimum thickness of crushed aggregate base course shall be nine inches (five inches of three-inch material, and four inches of one and one-half-inch material). 
No vehicular traffic shall be permitted on the pavement for a minimum period of between twenty-four (24) and seventy-two (72) hours following paving, as determined necessary by the city engineer to protect the new pavement. 
2.  Continuity and Transitions. All street pavement widths on streets continued from previously developed or platted streets shall, wherever practical, provide for the greater of either the existing or required pavement type, width, grade and cross slope. The design of the street extension shall be approved by the city engineer. 
Where it is necessary to provide for a transition of pavement width and/or type between new and existing streets, the transition shall occur in a safe manner as approved by the city engineer. In width transitions, the ratio of the transition length to width shall be not less than 15:1 unless the city engineer determines that special circumstances prevent use of such a ratio.

A.  The subdivider shall pay a stormwater management fee for each acre undergoing land division, or each fraction thereof. The fee shall be based on the acre-feet of storage required to detain the 25-year post-development storm and shall be determined by the city council by multiplying acre-feet of stormwater storage required by the current stormwater management unit fee. Acre-feet of stormwater storage required shall be calculated using the current version of TR-55 or other method as determined by the city engineer and the current requirements of this chapter. Note: All developments are subject to this fee.

Agreements will be prepared using the fee currently in effect and adjusted retroactively to January 1st when the new year cost index becomes available. 
16.36.040 - Stormwater management and fee in lieu of dedication. 
A.  Where, upon the recommendation of the city's public works committee, there is no land suitable for stormwater management facilities or the land would not be compatible with the city's stormwater management plan, comprehensive master plan, and/or official map, or if the city public works committee determines that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the subdivider shall pay a fee in lieu of making the required land dedication. The amount of this fee shall be in addition to the fee paid per Section 16.36.060 of this chapter and shall be determined by the acre-feet of storage required to detain the 25-year storm event. The fee in lieu of dedication shall be determined by the city council by multiplying acre-feet of stormwater storage required by the current stormwater management unit fee. Acre-feet of stormwater storage required shall be calculated using the current version of TR-55 and the current requirements of this chapter. 
    Note: Developments that provide on-site stormwater management facilities are not required to pay this fee.

Such fee is determined to cover the costs of the city engineer's review of the construction documents and such other administrative costs as may be incurred by the city engineer. This fee shall not include the costs for on-site inspection of the actual construction operations. Additional costs to the city for consulting services, inspections, testing, legal services, or any other costs resulting from the review shall be charged to the subdivider at the actual cost to the city as outlined in Section 16.32.060.

Where, in the discretion of the plan commission and the parks and recreation commission, there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed land division or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the city's comprehensive development plan or the parks and recreation commission determines that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the plan commission and parks and recreation commission may recommend to the committee of the whole that the subdivider pay a fee in lieu of making the required land dedication. The amount of any fee imposed shall be determined as follows: For each proposed development, the fee shall be the current rate as established by the common council for each dwelling unit. Any adjustment or changes in the number of dwelling units before final plat acceptance will be subject to this section.

3.  Subdividers shall make the lump sum payment identified in Option A above under the following circumstance: The development is less than twenty-five (25) dwelling units. 
4.  Failure to make the proper payments as defined above shall result in the immediate withholding of all building and occupancy permits until all delinquent payments are made to the city. 
C.  Additional Fee-Assessment Per Unit. In addition, at the time a building permit is issued for new construction of a single unit or multifamily units, a one-time fee per dwelling unit will be assessed for park development as established by the common council. These fees shall be placed in the park fund for park development. 
D.  Use of Fees Paid. The city shall place the fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in the park trust fund for land acquisition and park development.

    This title is applicable to all territory located within the corporate limits of the city of Sun Prairie. (Prior code § 13-1-9)

B.  All provisions of Title 17 of the city of Sun Prairie code of ordinances which are not reenacted herein are repealed.

    All plans approved under previous zoning regulations shall be valid and may be used to obtain permits for a period of not more than one year after the effective date of this title.

    The following subsections specify the purpose and intent of the standard zoning districts established by this title. References to "development options" refer to conventional, equestrian, and cluster development options which are explained in detail in Section 17.16.070. 
A.  Agricultural District. 
1.  Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District. This district is intended to permit development which is solely of a rural community character. The land use standards for this district permit very low density single-family residential development at an average density of one dwelling unit for every thirty-five (35) acres, as well as a variety of agricultural and agricultural support land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that development which requires even a minimum of urban services does not occur until such services are available. As such, the rural holding (RH-35ac) district shall either serve as a designation which preserves and protects agricultural activities, or as a "holding zone" which provides for an interim land use (agriculture) that will easily permit further development (with rezoning to another district) at the appropriate time. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no nonresidential land use within this district shall have direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the protection of agricultural activities, and a very low density residential area for those who want to live in a rural environment and who retain enough land with their residence to ensure that the rural environment is maintained as long as the rural holding (RH-35ac) district designation is retained. In this manner, even if all property were developed in a given area with the rural holding (RH-35ac) district designation, the rural community character of that area would still be maintained. 
B.  Residential Districts. 
1.  Countryside Residential (CR-5ac) District. This district is intended to permit development which has a very low density, countryside community character. Unlike the case for the rural holding (RH-35ac) district, the land use standards for this district permit primarily single-family detached residential development and a variety of related institutional land uses, and are not oriented to a wide range of agricultural activities. 
    Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the countryside residential (CR-5ac) district shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the countryside community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of approximately one dwelling unit for every five acres. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of a very low density residential area for those who want to live in a countryside environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the countryside community character is maintained as long as the countryside residential (CR-5ac) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
2.  Estate Residential (ER-1) District. This district is intended to permit development which has a low density, estate community character. Like the case for the countryside residential (CR-5ac) district, the land use standards for this district permit primarily single-family detached residential development and a variety of related institutional land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the estate residential (ER-1) district shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the estate community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of approximately one dwelling unit per acre. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of a low density residential area for those who want to live in an estate environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the estate community character is maintained as long as the estate residential (ER-1) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
3.  Suburban Residential (SR-4) District. This district is intended to permit development which has a moderate density, suburban community character. This district is intended to be the principal district for single-family development within the city. Unlike the case for the previously described residential districts, the land use standards for this district permit both single-family detached residential development and certain types of moderate density single-family attached development, as well as a variety of related institutional land uses. 
    Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the suburban residential (SR-4) district shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the suburban residential community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of approximately four dwelling units per acre. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of a moderate density residential area for those who want to live in a suburban residential environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the suburban community character is maintained as long as the suburban residential (SR-4) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
4.  Mixed Residential (MR-8) District. This district is intended to permit development which has a moderately high density community character which lies somewhere between suburban and urban. The land use standards for this district permit both single-family detached residential development and certain types of moderately high density single-family attached development permitted by right, and both moderately high density single-family attached development and certain types of multi-family development permitted as a conditional use, as well as a variety of related institutional land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the mixed residential (MR-8) district shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the moderately high density residential community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of approximately eight dwelling units per acre. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area for those who want to live in a moderately high density residential environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the desired community character is maintained as long as the mixed residential (MR-8) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. As such, this district is intended to provide the principal location for a wide range of single-family attached dwelling types, including twin houses, duplexes, atrium houses, and weak link townhouses. 
5.  Urban Residential (UR-12) District. This district is intended to permit development which has a high density, urban community character. The land use standards for this district permit both single-family detached and single-family attached development permitted by right, and multi-family development permitted as a conditional use, as well as a variety of related institutional land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the urban residential (UR-12) district shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the urban residential community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of approximately twelve (12) dwelling units per acre. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area for those who want to live in a high density residential environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the urban community character is maintained as long as the urban residential (UR-12) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. As such, it is intended to provide the principal location for multi-family development, including multiplexes and apartments. 
C.  Nonresidential Districts. 
1.  Suburban Office (SO) District. This district is intended to permit high-quality office and institutional land uses at an intensity compatible with the overall suburban community character of the city. A relatively low maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. In order to ensure a district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area for those who desire a high quality office environment which maintains the attractiveness of the site and retains enough open land in their development to ensure that the suburban community character is maintained as long as the suburban office (SO) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
2.  Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District. This district is intended to permit small scale commercial development which is compatible with the desired overall suburban community character of the area in general, and with adjacent residential development in particular. This is accomplished with relatively low maximum floor area ratios (FARs). Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is used to provide both convenience oriented goods and services and for the permanent protection of adjacent residential areas by permitting only a limited range of commercial activities. The desired suburban community character of the development is attained through the floor area ratio (FAR) and landscape surface area ratio (LSR) requirements, and by restricting the maximum building size (MBS) of all buildings on a lot within this district to fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet. Together, these requirements ensure that the desired suburban community character is maintained as long as the neighborhood commercial (NC) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
3.  Suburban Commercial (SC) District. This district is intended to permit large and small scale commercial development which is compatible with the desired overall suburban community character of the area in general. This is accomplished with relatively low maximum floor area ratios (FARs). Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to serve as the principal zoning district for commercial development which occurs after the adoption of this title. The standards of this district are designed to provide a clear distinction from the urban commercial (UC) and central commercial (CC) districts in terms of permitted intensity of development, and required green space areas. The desired suburban community character of the development is attained through the floor area ratio (FAR) and landscape surface area ratio (LSR) requirements. 
    Together, these requirements ensure that the desired suburban community character is maintained as long as the suburban commercial (SC) district designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. 
4.  Urban Commercial (UC) District. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale commercial development at intensities which provide significant incentives for infill development and the continued economic viability of existing development. To accomplish this effect, maximum permitted floor area ratios (FARs) are significantly higher and minimum required green space ratios (GSRs) are substantially lower than those required in the suburban commercial (SC) district. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to provide an alternative, primarily infill development, designation for commercial activity to the suburban commercial (SC) district. Performance standards for the urban commercial (UC) district are designed to ensure the long-term economic health of strip commercial development areas, existing as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, by limiting the attraction of the suburban commercial (SC) district to those uses which can afford the relatively higher development costs and rents associated with development in that district. 
5.  Central Commercial (CC) District. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale commercial development at an intensity which provides significant incentives for infill development, redevelopment, and the continued economic viability of existing development. To accomplish this effect, maximum floor area ratios (FARs) permitted in this district are much higher than those allowed in the suburban commercial (SC) and urban commercial (UC) districts. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. This district is strictly limited to downtown locations. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to provide a primarily infill development alternative for commercial activity to the suburban commercial (SC) and urban commercial (UC) district designed to assist in maintaining the long-term economic viability of the downtown. 
    Any demolition of an existing structure, construction of a new structure or substantial change to the exterior of any existing structure within the central commercial zoning district shall be allowed only after the city council has issued a conditional use permit authorizing the proposed demolition, new construction or substantial change of the structure. A conditional use permit shall not be required for general maintenance of the site. This conditional use permit requirement shall be in effect from December 21, 1999 to June 30, 2001. 
6.  Suburban Industrial (SI) District. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale industrial and office development at an intensity which is consistent with the overall desired suburban community character of the community. Beyond a relatively low maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and a relatively high minimum green space ratio (GSR), the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to indoor industrial activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for suburban intensity light industrial land uses such as assembly operations, storage and warehousing facilities, offices, and light manufacturing which are protected from potential nuisances associated with certain development permitted within the heavy industrial (HI) district. In addition, land uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in Chapter 17.36. 
7.  Urban Industrial (UI) District. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale industrial and office development at an intensity which is consistent with existing transition and urban intensity development in the older, southern areas of the community. Beyond a relatively high maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and a relatively high minimum green space ratio (GSR),the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to indoor industrial activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for urban intensity light industrial land uses such as assembly operations, storage and warehousing facilities, offices, and light manufacturing which are protected from potential nuisances associated with certain development permitted within the heavy industrial (HI) district. In addition, uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in Chapter 17.36. 
8.  Heavy Industrial (HI) District. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale industrial and office development at an intensity which provides ample incentive for infill development and redevelopment of industrial areas existing as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title. This district is designed to permit a very wide variety of industrial uses which may occur both indoors and outdoors, including certain land uses which are permitted in no other zoning district because of their potential to create nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
    Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for both light and heavy industrial uses in a zoning district in which the potential for nuisance complaints from nearby properties is minimized. It must be emphasized that this is not a district where virtually any land use is permitted, as all uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in Chapter 17.36. In addition, certain land uses such as extraction, junkyards and salvage operations, and freight terminals are permitted within this district only upon the granting of a conditional use permit. 
D.  This district is intended to permit planned developments for development and redevelopment in areas of the community that are experiencing a lack of significant reinvestment, and/or to accommodate forms of development that promote both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the city by controlling the site design and appearance, density or intensity of development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk, landscaping, and parking requirements. For the specific procedures and requirements governing the creation of planned development districts, see Sections 17.12.080 and 17.12.090. 
(Ord. 480, 1999; Ord. 460, (part), 1999; prior code § 13-3-5) 
17.12.060 - Environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay zoning districts. 
A.  This title employs overlay zoning districts to identify and regulate areas in which environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection requirements apply. Each type of natural or historic resource regulated by this title is represented by an overlay zoning district bearing its name. 
B.  Environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay districts include: 
Floodplain overlay district; 
Wetland overlay district; 
Drainageway overlay district 
Shoreland overlay district; 
Woodland overlay district; 
Steep slope overlay district; 
Ridge top overlay district; 
Prairie overlay district; 
Historic preservation overlay district. 
C.  For specific environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay district regulations, see Chapter 17.28. 
(Ord. 228A, § 3, 1-17-2006; prior code § 13-3-6) 
17.12.070 - Map of environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay districts. 
    Environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay zoning districts established by this title are shown on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map of the city, which together with all the explanatory material thereon, is made part of this title. For specific environmental corridor: natural and historic resource protection overlay district designation criteria, see Chapter 17.28. 
(Ord. 228A, § 4, 1-17-2006; prior code § 13-3-7) 
17.12.080 - Planned development (PD) district procedures. 
A.  Purpose. 
1.  The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed planned developments (PDs). 
2.  Planned developments are intended to foster development and redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of significant reinvestment, and/or to accommodate forms of development that forward public and private objectives that are not possible within standard zoning districts. Furthermore, planned developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the city by controlling the site design and the appearance, density or intensity of development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk, landscaping and parking requirements. Variation from certain land division ordinance provisions, official map requirements and other development-related regulations may also be sought under this process. In exchange for such flexibility, a planned development shall provide a much higher level of site design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments. 
3.  All planned developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to planned developments, in addition to the general requirements of the zoning ordinance. A public hearing process is required to review a request for a planned development. This process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with that required for a conditional use, with several additional requirements. 
(Ord. 460, (part), 1999; prior code § 13-3-8 (part), 1999) 
17.12.090 - Planned development district regulations. 
A.  Provision of Flexible Development Standards for Planned Developments. 
1.  Permitted Location. Planned developments shall be permitted with the approval of a planned development zoning district, specific to the approved planned development in accordance with the procedures of subsections 2.F. and G., of this section. 
2.  Flexible Development Standards. The following variations from the development standards of the most comparable standard zoning district(s) may be provided with the approval of a planned development. 
a.  Land Use Requirements. All land uses considered as "residential", "institutional", "commercial", "office", "light industrial", or "recreational" may be permitted within a planned development as specified in the general development plan and the precise implementation plan for the approved planned development. 
b.  Density and Intensity Requirements. All requirements listed for residential density (number of dwelling units per acre) and nonresidential intensity (percentage of lot area compared to total floor area and impervious surface area) shall be as specified in the approved planned development. 
c.  Bulk Requirements. All bulk requirements (building setback and height) shall be as specified in the approved planned development. 
d.  Landscaping Requirements. All landscaping requirements shall be as specified in the approved planned development. 
e.  Parking and Loading Requirements. All requirements for off-street parking, traffic circulation, and off-street loading shall be as specified in the approved planned development. 
f.  Other Development Requirements Imposed by Ordinance or Plan. Requirements of the land division ordinance, official map or other local regulations or plans shall be as specified in the approved planned development. 
3.  Requirements to Depict All Aspects of Development. Only development which is explicitly depicted on the site plan required by the city as part of the approved planned development shall be permitted, even if such development (including all aspects of land use, density and bulk, landscaping, and parking and loading) is otherwise permitted. 
4.  Minimum Site Area Requirements. The minimum site areas required for planned development projects shall be as follows: 
Central commercial district planned developments No minimum site area requirement Infill planned developments* 1 acre (43,560 square feet) Residential planned developments 3 acres (130,680 square feet) Commercial and office planned developments 3 acres (130,680 square feet) Mixed use planned developments 5 acres (217,800 square feet) Industrial planned developments 10 acres (435,600 square feet)  
* "Infill planned developments" are defined as new development or redevelopment projects that are proposed on scattered, vacant sites within already developed areas or neighborhoods. 
B.  Initiation of Request for Approval of a Planned Development. Proceedings for approval of a planned development shall be initiated by: 
1.  An application of the owner(s) of the subject property; or 
2.  A recommendation of the plan commission and action by the common council, relative to city-owned property. 
C.  Application Requirements. All applications for proposed planned developments, regardless of the party of their initiation per subsection B., of this section, shall be certified as complete by the zoning administrator. Such applications, when complete, shall apply to each of the process steps in subsections E. through G., of this section. With the plan commission's approval (and generally for simple PDs), the applicant may combine PD process steps as deemed appropriate. 
D.  PD Process Step 1: Pre-Application Conference (Optional). 
1.  The applicant (may) contact the zoning administrator to place an informal discussion item for the PD on the plan commission agenda. 
2.  No details beyond the name of the applicant, the location of the subject property, a listing of potential land uses, and the identification of the discussion item as a PD is required to be given in the agenda. 
3.  At the plan commission meeting, the applicant shall engage in an informal discussion with the plan commission regarding the potential PD. Appropriate topics for discussion may include the location of the PD, general project themes and images, the general mix of types and/or land uses being considered, approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities, the general treatment of natural features, the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets, potential development phasing limitations, and relationship to the comprehensive (master) plan. 
4.  Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall in no way be binding upon the applicant or the city, but should be considered as the informal, nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step. 
E.  PD Process Step 2: Concept Plan (Required). 
1.  The applicant shall provide the zoning administrator with an application and a draft PD concept plan submittal packet for a determination of completeness prior to placing the proposed PD on the plan commission and committee of the whole agenda for concept plan review. This submittal packet shall contain all of the following items, prior to its acceptance by the zoning administrator and placement on the agenda for concept plan review: 
a.  A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches, as depicted on a copy of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive (master) plan land use plan map; 
b.  A general written description of the proposed PD including: 
i.  General project themes and images; 
ii.  The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses; 
iii.  Approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio (total building floor area divided by site area) and impervious surface area ratio (total impervious surface area divided by site area); 
iv.  The general treatment of natural features; 
v.  The general relationship to nearby properties and public streets; 
vi.  The general relationship of the project to the comprehensive (master) plan; 
vii.  Proposed development phasing, including a plan illustrating the sequence of development on the property and expected number of dwelling units to be constructed per year. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall prepare a written description of requested variations from the requirements of the most comparable standard zoning district(s) and land division ordinance requirements, including: 
i.  Land use; 
ii.  Density and intensity; 
iii.  Bulk; 
iv.  Access, parking and loading; 
v.  Landscaping; 
vi.  Variations related to other municipal ordinances and plans including engineering and public works standards and requirements. 
    The purpose of this listing shall be to provide the plan commission with information necessary to determine the relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public benefit resulting from design flexibility. 
d.  A concept plan drawing (at eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches) of the general land use layout and location of major public streets and/or private drives. The applicant may submit copies of a larger version in addition to the eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches. 
2.  Once the zoning administrator has received a complete packet as determined by the administrator, the proposed PD concept plan shall be placed on the plan commission agenda within forty-five (45) days of the city's receipt of a complete packet. 
3.  At the plan commission meeting, the applicant shall engage in an informal discussion regarding the concept plan PD. Appropriate topics for discussion may include any of the information provided in the PD concept plan submittal packet, or other items as determined by the plan commission. 
4.  Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall be in no way be binding upon the applicant or the city, but should be considered as the informal, nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step. 
5.  If approval or conditional approval of the concept plan is recommended by the plan commission, the concept plan shall be referred to the committee of the whole for consideration. The committee of the whole shall then review and comment on the concept plan. The committee of the whole's review and comments are advisory. 
6.  Approval or conditional approval of the concept plan by the plan commission shall entitle the developer to prepare and submit to the plan commission a general development plan, provided the general development plan conforms substantially to the concept plan, including any conditions of approval. If the concept plan is approved by the plan commission, the general development plan must be filed within six months of the date of concept plan approval by the plan commission or the concept plan is void. Previous concept plan approvals shall not constitute grounds for automatic approval upon resubmission. 
F.  PD Process Step 3: General Development Plan (GDP) (Required). 
1.  The applicant shall provide the zoning administrator with an application and a draft GDP submittal packet for a determination of completeness prior to placing the proposed GDP on the plan commission agenda for GDP review. The zoning administrator shall place the draft GDP on the plan commission agenda within forty-five (45) days of receiving a complete GDP submittal packet. This submittal packet shall contain all of the following items, prior to its acceptance by the zoning administrator and placement of the item on a plan commission agenda for GDP review: 
a.  A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches, as depicted on a copy of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive (master) plan land use plan map; 
b.  A vicinity map of the subject property showing all lands for which the planned development is proposed, and all other lands within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on such map as the same appear on the current records of the register of deeds of Dane County. Such map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control, and which watershed the project area lies within. Such map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals eight hundred (800) feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
c.  A general written description of proposed PD including: 
i.  General project themes and images; 
ii.  The general mix of land uses, including (if applicable) dwelling unit types; 
iii.  Approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio (the total floor area divided by the site area) and impervious surface area ratio (the total impervious surface area divided by the site area); 
iv.  The general treatment of natural features; 
v.  The general relationship to nearby properties, and to public streets, utilities and facilities; 
vi.  The general relationship of the project to the comprehensive (master) plan; 
vii.  A statement of rationale as to why PD zoning is proposed. This shall identify barriers that the applicant perceives in the form of the requirements of standard zoning districts, and the opportunities for community betterment the applicant suggests are available through the proposed PD zoning; 
viii.  The zoning administrator shall prepare a complete list and description of zoning and land division ordinance standards of the most comparable standard zoning district(s)/requirements which will not be met by the proposed PD and the location(s) in which they apply, and a complete list of zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed PD and the location(s) in which they apply shall be identified. A list of items shall be provided, including: 
1.  Land use; 
2.  Density and intensity; 
3.  Bulk; 
4.  Landscaping; 
5.  Access, parking and loading requirements; 
6.  Variations related to other municipal ordinances and plans including engineering and public works standards and requirements. 
    The purpose of this list shall be to provide the committee of the whole, plan commission, public works committee, technical review committee and other review bodies with the information necessary to determine the relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public benefit created by design flexibility. 
d.  A general development plan drawing at a minimum scale of one inch equals one hundred (100) feet (eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches) reduction shall also be provided by applicant) of the proposed project showing at least the following information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against criteria for approval: 
i.  A conceptual site plan drawing (at eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches) of the general land use layout and the general location of major public streets and/or private drives. The applicant may submit copies of a larger version of this "bubble plan" in addition to the eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches reduction; 
ii.  Location of recreational and open space areas and facilities and specifically describing those that are to be reserved or dedicated for public acquisition and use, stormwater facilities, drainageways, and floodplains; 
iii.  Statistical data on minimum lot sizes in the development, the approximate areas of large development lots and pads, density/intensity of various parts of the development, floor area ratio, impervious surface area ratio and landscape surface area ratio of various land uses, expected staging, and any other plans required by the plan commission or common council; 
iv.  Notations relating the written information provided in subsection (F)(1)(c)(i) through (vi) to specific areas on the GDP drawing; 
v.  Maps shall include existing topography, locations of public streets, sidewalks and bicycle paths. 
e.  A general conceptual landscaping plan for subject property, noting in text and/or general map labels, the anticipated general compliance with requirements for the locations of foundation, street, yard and paving, landscaping; and anticipated instances of noncompliance with the landscaping requirements of the ordinance codified in this title (as noted in the listing of variations prepared by the zoning administrator) and the anticipated use of extra landscaping and bufferyards. Land uses exempted by the zoning ordinance from required landscaping such as agricultural uses and detached single-family dwellings are not required to provide conceptual or detailed landscaping plans. 
f.  For single building planned developments, a series of general conceptual building elevations depicting the general architectural theme for the planned development, including notes as to the general range of materials and colors proposed. For multi-building planned developments, a written description of the proposed range of architectural character(s) for the planned development, and sample drawings and/or photos for this project or other developments that provide visual examples of such character(s). 
g.  A general conceptual signage plan for the project, including project identification signs, concepts for public fixtures and signs (such as street light fixtures and/or poles or street sign faces and/or poles), and group development signs which are proposed to vary from city standards or common practices. 
h.  Written Justification for the Proposed Planned Development. (The applicant shall follow the requirements of the zoning map amendment procedure in Section 17.44.030 of the city of Sun Prairie zoning ordinance to develop such written justification.) The applicant must demonstrate that the generally desired balance between public and private benefits associated with standard development is improved in the public's favor with the approval of the proposed planned development. 
i.  A development phasing plan that demonstrates compliance with the city's development phasing plan. 
2.  The city may require the developer (after the developer has been notified by the city of the need for the study) to conduct, at the developer's expense, a traffic impact study. The city shall require the developer to enter into a predevelopment agreement, obligating the developer to reimburse the city for any additional costs it incurs, including without limitation, time incurred by city staff in reviewing the project. 
3.  The proposed GDP shall be forwarded to the plan commission for review and public hearing. After holding a public hearing, the plan commission shall make a recommendation to the common council for approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the proposed GDP. The plan commission and common council may, upon consideration of the request, table the GDP for a reasonable period of time to obtain more information or clarification of issues directly related to the consideration of the GDP. The same procedures used for amendments to the official zoning map shall be followed for this process. 
4.  If the common council conditionally approves the PD/GDP, the applicant shall submit, to the zoning administrator, a copy of the PD/GDP that satisfies the conditions of approval. Once the zoning administrator has certified that the conditions have been satisfied, an affidavit of notice for the PD/GDP shall be recorded with the Dane County Register of Deeds. Along with paper copies, the applicant shall submit an electronic copy of the final PD/GDP, in a format as specified by the zoning administrator. 
5.  Approval of the PD/GDP shall establish the basic right of use for the area in conformity with the PD/GDP as approved, which shall be recorded by the zoning administrator as an integral component of the district regulations, but such PD/GDP shall not make permissible any of the uses as proposed until a precise implementation plan (PIP) is submitted and approved for all or a portion of the PD/GDP. 
G.  PD Process Step 4: Precise Implementation Plan (PIP) (Required). 
1.  After the approval date of the rezoning to PD/GDP (i.e., the date of the ordinance approval of the GDP by the common council) and certification that any conditions of approval have been satisfied, the applicant may file an application for a proposed precise implementation plan (PIP) with the plan commission. The zoning administrator shall place the proposed PIP on the agenda of the plan commission within forty-five (45) days of receiving a complete PIP submittal packet from the applicant. This submittal packet shall contain all of the following items, prior to its acceptance by the zoning administrator and placement of the item on a plan commission agenda for review: 
a.  A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches, as depicted on a copy of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive (master) plan land use plan map; 
b.  A vicinity map of the subject property showing all lands for which the planned development is proposed, and all other lands within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on such map as the names appear on the current records of the register of deeds of Dane County. Such map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Such map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals eight hundred (800) feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
c.  A general written description of proposed PIP including: 
i.  Specific project themes and images; 
ii.  The specific mix of land uses, including (if applicable) dwelling unit types; 
iii.  Specific residential densities and nonresidential intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio (the total floor area divided by the site area) and impervious surface area ratio (the total impervious surface area divided by the site area); 
iv.  The specific treatment of natural features; 
v.  The specific relationship to nearby properties, and to public streets, utilities and facilities; 
d.  A precise implementation plan drawing at a minimum scale of one inch equals one hundred (100) feet (eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches reduction shall also be provided by applicant) of the proposed project showing at least the following information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against criteria for approval: 
i.  A PIP site plan conforming to any and all of the requirements of the site plan review and approval procedures required by the city. If the proposed planned development is a cluster development, a proposed preliminary plat or conceptual plat shall be provided in addition to the required site plan; 
ii.  Location of recreational and open space areas and facilities, stormwater facilities and drainageways and specifically describing those that are to be reserved or dedicated for public acquisition and use; 
iii.  Statistical data on minimum lot sizes in the development, the precise areas of all development lots and pads, density/intensity of various parts of the development, floor area ratio, impervious surface area ratio and landscape surface area ratio of various land uses, expected staging, and any other plans required by the plan commission or common council; 
iv.  Notations relating the written information provided in subsections (F)(1)(c)(i) through (vi) of this section to specific areas on the PIP drawing; 
v.  Precise implementation plan drawings shall include all street and utility layouts, storm water systems, detention/retention facilities (sizing and calculations) and pedestrian ways; 
vi.  Location of proposed right-of-way and street widths for all streets within the proposed development. 
e.  A landscaping plan for subject property, specifying the location, species, and installed size of all trees and shrubs. This plan shall also include a chart which provides a cumulative total for each species, type and required location (foundation, yard, street, paved area or bufferyard) of all plants. Land uses exempted by the zoning ordinance from required landscaping such as agricultural uses and detached single-family dwellings are not required to provide conceptual or detailed landscaping plans. 
f.  A series of building elevations for the entire exterior of all buildings in the planned development, including detailed notes as to the materials and colors proposed except for single-family detached and duplex dwellings which shall follow general design guidelines established by the developer and approved as part of the PIP. 
g.  A signage plan for the project, including all project identification signs, concepts for public fixtures and signs (such as street light fixtures and/or poles or street sign faces and/or poles), and group development signage themes which are proposed to vary from city standards or common practices. 
h.  A general outline of the intended organizational structure for a property owners' association, if any, deed restrictions and provisions for private provision of common services, if any. 
i.  A written description which demonstrates the full consistency of the proposed PIP with the approved PD/GDP, including development phasing limitations established in the GDP. 
j.  Any and all deviations between the requirements of the applicable PD/GDP zoning district and the proposed PIP development; 
k.  The area included in a precise implementation plan may be only a portion of the area included in a previously approved PD/GDP; 
l.  A timeline indicating anticipated construction phasing including, the dates that project construction will commence and project construction will be complete. 
2.  When the PIP submission is deemed by the zoning administrator to be complete, the matter shall be reviewed by city staff and then placed on the agenda of the plan commission for review, consideration and a recommendation for approval, approval with conditions, or denial. No public hearing is required at this stage. 
3.  The PIP submission shall be reviewed by the plan commission against the standards of the ordinance codified in this title, Title 16, Subdivisions and the previously approved PD/GDP. The plan commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the PIP. The plan commission may, upon consideration of the request, table the PIP for a reasonable period of time to obtain more information or clarification of issues directly related to the consideration of the PIP. In order to approve a PIP or approve with conditions, the plan commission must determine that the PIP is consistent with the previously approved PD/GDP. 
4.  The common council shall consider and act on the PIP after reviewing the recommendations of the plan commission on the same. The common council shall approve, approve with conditions, refer for further consideration, or deny the PIP. The common council may, upon consideration of the request, table the PIP for a reasonable period of time to obtain more information or clarification of issues directly related to the consideration of the PIP. 
a.  For PIPs associated with PD/GDPs approved prior to November 6, 2008, the common council shall approve a PIP that is consistent with the previously approved PD/GDP. 
b.  For PIPs associated with PD/GDPs approved after November 6, 2008, the common council shall consider the PIP's compliance with the general written description of the PD/GDP as required in Section 17.12.090(E)(1)(b) (including the general project theme), the standards of the zoning ordinance and the standards of the subdivision ordinance. 
5.  If the common council conditionally approves the PD/PIP, the applicant shall submit, to the zoning administrator, a PIP that satisfies the conditions of approval. Once the zoning administrator has certified that the conditions have been satisfied, the applicant may apply for a building permit. Along with paper copies, the applicant shall submit an electronic copy of the final PD/PIP, in a format as specified by the zoning administrator. 
6.  Prior to construction of any required land division improvements and before the issuance of any building permits, the applicant and the owner shall enter into a development agreement with the city per the requirements of Section 16.32.020 of the city of Sun Prairie subdivision ordinance to guarantee the implementation of the development according to the terms and conditions established as part of the PD/GDP and PD/PIP, including any building permit limits necessary for compliance with the approved GDP, PIP, and/or the city's development phasing plan. 
7.  This paragraph shall only apply to PIPs associated with PD/GDPs approved after November 6, 2008. Within twenty-four (24) months of the approval of a PIP by the common council, the PIP as approved shall be commenced by the issuance of a building permit except for single-family and duplex uses where a single PIP is intended to cover multiple lots within a subdivision to be built over a number of years. Failure to commence the PIP by the issuance of a building permit within the 24-month period shall render the PIP null and void. Within the initial 24-month period, the applicant may request a one-time extension of the PIP for up to twenty-four (24) months. Such request shall require approval by resolution of the common council. For PIP's that include multiple buildings, the issuance of a building permit for the first building shall satisfy the requirements of this section, provided that detailed building plans and site plans are provided for all buildings within the area covered by the PIP. 
H.  Planned Development Implementation. Upon approval of a development agreement between the developer and the city per Section 16.32.020 of the city of Sun Prairie subdivision ordinance, and upon approval of the PD/PIP by the common council, the applicant may apply for building permits, zoning and use permits from the zoning administrator. Upon granting of the necessary permits, and following city review and approval of all construction plans and specifications, the applicant may commence construction. 
I.  Determination of Most Comparable Standard Zoning Districts. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for making a determination as to the most comparable set of standard zoning districts. 
J.  Fees. Required fees shall be as set by resolution of the common council. Any municipal consultant costs, and (if land is to be divided) costs of reviewing the preliminary and final plats of the subdivision per the municipal code shall be reimbursed by the applicant. These reimbursement expenses are in addition to the regular application fee.

Chapter 17.16 - LAND USE REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.16.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to indicate which land uses may locate in each zoning district and under what requirements; and which land uses may not locate therein. A further distinction is made for land uses which may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a conditional or temporary use permit to do so. Finally, certain land uses may locate in a given district as a matter of right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use. 
(Prior code § 13-4-1) 
17.16.020 - Interpretation of land use tables. 
A.  The land uses listed in Sections 17.16.030 (Table of Land Uses) and 17.16.040 (Table of Land Uses Permitted in Permanently Protected Green Space Areas) are specifically designated and refer to the detailed listing of land uses contained in Sections 17.16.060. 
B.  Land Uses Permitted by Right. Land uses listed as permitted by right (designated as a "P" in Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.040) are permitted per the general land use requirements of this title (Section 17.16.050), per the general requirements of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay zoning districts as designated on the official zoning map; per the general requirements of this title; and per any and all other applicable city, county, state, and federal regulations. 
C.  Land Uses Permitted as a Special Use. This category of land uses is subject to certain additional controls than apply to land uses permitted by right, while avoiding the public hearing process required of land uses permitted as conditional uses. 
1.  Land uses listed as permitted as a special use (designated as an "S" in Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.040) are permitted subject to all of the general zoning requirements applicable to land uses permitted by right (subsection B of this section), plus certain additional requirements applicable to that particular land use specified in Section 17.16.060 through 17.16.160. (See also Section 17.44.040.) 
2.  If a proposed land use, listed as a special use, cannot meet one of the special use requirements of Section 17.16.060 for reasons directly related to the nature of the subject property, the petitioner of such land use may request plan commission and city council review for approval as a conditional use, per the requirements of Section 17.44.050. No more than one special use requirement shall be waived in this manner for any given land use or property. See subsection (D)(2) of this section. 
D.  Land Uses Permitted as a Conditional Use. 
1.  Land uses listed as permitted as a conditional use (designated as a "C" in Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.040) are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in subsection B of this section, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as contained in Section 17.16.060 through 17.16.160, including any additional requirements imposed as part of the conditional use review process. Each application for, and instance of, a conditional use shall be considered a unique situation and shall not be construed as precedence for similar requests. (See also Section 17.44.050.) 
2.  Conditional use requirements also apply to proposed special uses when one of the special use requirements cannot be met. (See subsection (C)(2) of this section.) No more than one special use requirement shall be waived in this manner. 
E.  Land uses listed as permitted as an accessory use are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in subsection B of this section, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as contained in Sections 17.16.060 through 17.16.160. 
F.  Land uses listed as permitted as a temporary use (designated as a "S" in Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.040) are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by special use as listed in subsection C of this section, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as contained in Sections 17.16.060 through 17.16.160. (See also Section 17.44.040.) 
G.  Land uses for which a blank space is shown for a specific zoning district are not permitted in such zoning district, except as legal nonconforming uses. (See Section 17.16.170.) 
H.  Although a land use may be indicated as permitted by right, permitted as a special use, or permitted as a conditional use in a particular district, it does not follow that such a land use is permitted or permissible on every parcel in such district. No land use is permitted or permissible on a parcel unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards and regulations of this title which are applicable to the specific land use and parcel in question, or unless an appropriate variance has been granted pursuant to Section 17.44.080. 
(Prior code § 13-4-2) 
17.16.030 - Table of Land Uses. 
    This title regulates the location of land uses to specific zoning districts through the use of the Table of Land Uses contained in this section.

I.  Number of Buildings Per Lot. In the RH-35ac, CR-5ac, ER-1, and SR-4 districts, only one principal building shall be permitted on any one lot. In the MR-8, UR-12, SO, NC, SC, UC, CC, SI, UI, and HI districts, more than one principal building shall be permitted on any one lot upon the granting of a conditional use permit for a group development in compliance with Section 17.16.180. 
J.  Number of Land Uses Per Building. 
1.  No more than three nonresidential land uses shall be permitted in any building unless a conditional use permit for a group development is granted in compliance with Section 17.16.180. 
2.  With the exceptions of a commercial apartment or a home occupation, no building containing a nonresidential land use shall contain a residential land use. (See Sections 17.16.140(1) and (19).) 
K.  Division or Combining of a Lot. No recorded lot shall be divided into two or more lots, and no two or more recorded lots shall be combined into one or more lots, unless such division or combination results in the creation of lots, each of which conforms to all of the applicable regulations of the zoning district in which such lot is located (as set forth in this title). (See also Title 16, land division regulations.) (Prior code § 13-4-5) 
17.16.060 - Detailed land use descriptions and regulations. 
    The land use categories employed by this title (particularly Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.040) are defined in this title. Land uses which are not listed in this title are not necessarily excluded from locating within any given zoning district. Section 17.48.020 empowers the zoning administrator to make interpretations on matters regarding specific land use proposals which are not addressed by this title. (Prior code § 13-4-6 (part)) 
17.16.070 - Residential land uses-Development options. 
    Specific residential unit types (such as a single-family detached house on a forty thousand (40,000) square foot lot, a duplex, twin house, atrium house, weak-link townhouse, multiplex, or apartment, etc.) are defined in Section 17.24.030 which provides standards for each residential unit type. 
A.  Conventional Residential Development. Description. This land use includes, but is not limited to, all residential developments which do not provide permanently protected green space areas. Property which is under common ownership of a property owners' association is permitted, but is not a required component of this type of development. Up to ten percent (10%) of a conventional residential development's gross site area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space areas), without a reduction in maximum gross density (MGD). (See subsection I of this section.) 
1.  Permitted by right (RH-35ac, CR-5ac, ER-1, SR-4, MR-8, UR-12); 
2.  Special use regulations: Not applicable; 
3.  Conditional use regulations: Not applicable. 
B.  Equestrian Residential Development. Description: This land use is a form of loose cluster residential development, subsection C of this section, which permits the keeping of horses on private lots or on common green space. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the development's gross site area (GSA) shall be held under common ownership by a homeowners' association. This commonly-held area shall be used to provide equestrian facilities which are available to all residents of the development. These facilities may include common pasture area, group stables, riding trails, training areas, or other land uses typically associated with equestrian activities (including kennel facilities for private, noncommercial hunt club operations). With the exception of riding trails, (which may be linked to a general trail network extending beyond the area of the equestrian development) such areas shall only be used by the residents of the equestrian residential development and their guests, and no facilities within an equestrian development shall be operated as a for-profit commercial venture. Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of an equestrian residential development's gross site area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space area (per Section 17.28.110), without a reduction in maximum gross density (MGD). (See subsection I of this section.) 
1.  Permitted by right: Not applicable. 
2.  Special use regulations: Not applicable. 
3.  Conditional use regulations (CR-5ac): 
a.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the gross site area (GSA) of the development shall be held in common ownership by a homeowner's association and shall be devoted to equestrian facilities. 
b.  Each lot shall have direct access to an equestrian trail maintained by a homeowner's association. 
c.  Any stable facility shall be reserved for the exclusive use of the development's residents. No stable located within an equestrian residential development shall be operated as a for-profit commercial venture. 
d.  All stables located on individual lots shall conform to the standards of Section 17.16.140(7). 
e.  All stables serving the equestrian residential development as a whole shall conform to the standards of Section 17.16.100(J). 
f.  Shall provide appropriate deed restrictions and performance bonds to ensure the long-term maintenance and viability of common areas and the development as a whole. 
g.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.050, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses. 
C.  Loose Cluster Development. Description: This land use is a residential subdivision which requires that a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the development's gross site area (GSA) be protected as permanently protected green space (per Section 17.28.110). This form of development permits slightly higher maximum gross densities (MGDs), and dwelling unit types which require slightly smaller lots, than conventional residential developments within the same zoning district. This density incentive is provided because the provision of the required common green space balances with the density increase to result in a community character which is consistent with such conventional residential developments. Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of a loose cluster development's gross site area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space area), without a reduction in maximum gross density (MGD). (See subsection I of this section.) 
1.  Permitted by right: Not applicable; 
2.  Special use regulations: Not applicable; 
3.  Conditional use regulations (CR-5ac, ER-1, SR-4, MR-8, UR-12): 
a.  Development clusters shall be located so as to blend with adjacent residentially zoned areas to the greatest extent possible,

D.  Moderate Cluster Development. Description: This land use is a residential subdivision which requires that a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the development's gross site area (GSA) be protected as permanently protected green space (per Section 17.28.110). This form of development permits higher maximum gross densities (MGDs), and dwelling unit types which require smaller lots, than conventional residential developments within the same zoning district. This density incentive is provided because the provision of the required common green space balances with the density increase to result in a community character which is consistent with such conventional residential developments. Up to fifty percent (50%) of a moderate cluster development's gross site area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected, (or other permanently protected green space areas), without a reduction in maximum gross density (MGD). (See subsection I of this section.)

    Commentary: The incorporation of this subsection into this title is designed to reflect the common council's official finding that sexually-oriented commercial uses have a predominant tendency to produce certain undesirable secondary effects on the surrounding community, as has been demonstrated in other, similar jurisdictions. Specifically, the common council is concerned with the potential for such uses to limit: the attractiveness of nearby locations for new development, the ability to attract and/or retain customers, and the ability to market and sell nearby properties at a level consistent with similar properties not located near such facilities. 
    It is explicitly not the intent of this subsection to suppress free expression by unreasonably limiting alternative avenues of communication, but rather to balance the need to protect free expression opportunities with the need to implement the city's comprehensive plan and protect the character and integrity of its commercial and residential neighborhoods.

17.16.170 - Nonconforming use regulations. 
A.  Definition: A nonconforming use is an active and actual use of land or structures, or both; legally established prior to the effective date of this title or subsequent applicable amendment thereto which has continued the same use to the present, and which would not be permitted under the current terms of this title. 
B.  Continuance of a Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this title may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as specified in this section. 
C.  Modification of a Nonconforming Use: 
1.  Except as permitted in subsection C.2. of this section, a nonconforming use shall not be expanded, or changed to another nonconforming use; unless such modification would make the nonconforming use have a more desirable effect in terms of implementing the purpose of this title (as determined by the zoning administrator). If such a modification occurs, such use shall not be modified back to the original nonconforming use, or to any other nonconforming use which does not better accomplish the purpose of this title. 
2.  A nonconforming nonresidential use which is not served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if such facilities are not available within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property, and upon the granting of a conditional use permit per the requirements of Section 17.44.050. 
D.  Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use: When any nonconforming use of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of such structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of this title. 
E.  Maintenance of a Nonconforming Use: The normal maintenance of a structure or land containing or related to a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this title. In no instance shall such repairs exceed fifty percent (50%) of the value of such structure or property prior to such repairs. 
F.  Nonconforming Lots, Structures and Buildings: See Sections 17.24.100 and 17.24.110. 
G.  Legal, Nonconforming Residential Uses in Nonresidential Districts: A legal nonconforming residential use, existing as of March 16, 1989, is eligible to be approved a conditional use within any zoning district in which it is not permitted under the regulations of Chapter 17.16 of this title. The procedure for reviewing such request shall follow the requirements of Section 17.44.050. The conditional use shall be for a specified initial time period not to exceed five years, and shall remain in effect throughout the period unless revoked for failure to comply with applicable conditions. 
    A conditional use issued under this section may be renewed one or more times by the zoning administrator for time periods not to exceed five years for each renewal. The zoning administrator shall grant a renewal if the applicant demonstrates continuing compliance with all requirements of this section and all applicable conditions attached to the original conditional use. 
    Applications for renewal shall be processed under the procedures for special use permit in Section 17.48.050. To obtain conditional use approval, the petitioner must meet the requirements of Section 17.44.050, and also must demonstrate: 
1.  That the subject property and its environs are not subject to an active transition of land uses or property assemblage as a precursor to land use transition, as demonstrated by transfers of ownership, assemblage of options, or related activity; and 
2.  That the subject property, including all on-site development, has been maintained so as to meet or exceed standards established by the city of Sun Prairie property maintenance ordinance. 
    A conditional use permit issued under this section shall not be revoked during an initial or renewed term on grounds of noncompliance with the property maintenance ordinance if the reason for noncompliance is a fire or similar disaster and the residence is promptly rebuilt or repaired to be in compliance within one hundred eighty (180) days. 
    Owners of more than one property may file jointly a single conditional use application under this section, provided that such properties are located within the same block and are comparable in terms of subsections (G)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(Prior code § 13-4-7) 
17.16.180 - Group developments. 
A.  Definition: A group development is any development containing two or more structures containing principal land uses (as listed in Table 17.16.040) on the same lot, and/or any single structure on a single lot which contains five or more dwelling units. Common examples of group developments include six-unit apartment buildings, apartment complexes, condominium complexes, shopping centers, and office centers. (One-building office structures, one-building commercial strip centers, four-unit apartment buildings, and other land uses in which each lot contains only one structure and where each residential building contains four or fewer dwelling units, are not group developments, even though such developments may contain parcels under common ownership.) 
B.  Regulation of Group Developments: Group developments are permitted as conditional uses in all zoning districts. Any land use which is permitted within the applicable zoning district(s) is permitted to locate within a group development. The land use regulations of this section, as well as Sections 17.16.060 through 17.16.160 and all other applicable provisions of this title shall apply to the group development. The requirements of Section 17.44.050 shall apply to the review of proposals for group developments. 
C.  Specific Development Standards for Group Developments: 
1.  All required off-street parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development. 
2.  Each individual land use shall have a rear or side entrance that is accessible to a loading or service drive. Such service drive shall have a minimum width of twenty-six (26) feet. Such service drive shall not be part of the vehicle circulation network used by customers. 
3.  The development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner. 
4.  All development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this title regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines. As such, individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes which serve to demonstrate complete compliance with such intent. Such building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments. The use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future (if such action is so desired). 
5.  Building permit limitations may be placed on the proposed development in order to assure compliance with the city's development phasing plan. Said limitations shall be detailed within a developer's agreement between the city and the developer that shall be executed prior to the issuance of any building permits. 
D.  Discrimination Against Condominium Forms of Ownership: It is not the intent of this section, nor any other provision of this title, to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with Section 703.27, Wisconsin Statutes. As such, the provisions of this section are designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development.

Any change in use, demolition of an existing structure, construction of a new structure or substantial change to the exterior of any existing structure within a business district revitalization overlay district as depicted on the city of Sun Prairie official zoning map (Sheet 3) shall be allowed only after the city council has issued a conditional use permit in accordance with Section 17.44.050 of this title authorizing the proposed change in use, demolition, new construction or substantial change of the structure. A conditional use permit shall not be required for general maintenance of the site, or for Indoor Sales and Service Uses within existing storefront buildings in the traditional Main Street business district (between Vine Street and South Street). Conditional use permits shall only be granted if the city council, after considering the report of the staff and recommendation of the city plan commission, determines that the proposed conditional use permit is consistent with the recommendations of the duly adopted city of Sun Prairie business district revitalization plan (especially pages 37 through 60 V. Recommendations for the Downtown) and the requirements of Section 17.44.050 
(Ord. 560, § 1, 4-15-2014; Ord. 575 § 4, 2001; prior code § 13-4-9) 
17.16.200 - Main Street corridor overlay (MSO) district regulations. 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of this section is to aid in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the West Main Street corridor plan, an element of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan, to encourage high quality redevelopment and revitalization of lands located within the Main Street corridor overlay district as established on Sheet 6 of the official zoning map per Section 17.12.170 of this title. 
B.  Applicability: The provisions of this section shall provide the primary development and redevelopment regulations for properties located within the Main Street corridor overlay district boundary, and supersede other development regulations and standards contained within this title.

Unless otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of the MSO shall apply to all new buildings and building additions that expand the gross floor area of an existing building by two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet or twenty-five percent (25%), whichever is less. Smaller expansions shall conform to the provisions of the applicable base zoning district regulations, but in such instances applicants are encouraged to follow the site and building design standards contained herein to the extent practicable. 
2.  The provisions of the MSO shall not apply to legally established uses and occupancies in place as of January 6, 2011, which may continue in their current configuration as legally conforming uses under the terms of the base zoning district regulations as provided in this title. 
3.  The provisions of the MSO shall not apply to new businesses or tenants occupying an existing building or lease space, provided that the new use is permitted by right within the applicable base zoning district. When site and/or building modifications are proposed as part of such projects, applicants are encouraged to follow the site and building design standards contained herein to the extent practicable. 
4.  The establishment of a use identified in Title 17 as a special use within the applicable base zoning district regulations that is to be established within an existing building, that does not involve new construction or a building expansion as defined above, and that is not subject to the provisions of the MSO, shall comply with the procedures for all special uses outlined in Section 17.44.040 and the base zoning district regulations per this title. Approval may be conditioned upon the correction of nonconforming site conditions such as, but not limited to, deficiencies associated with required parking and parking dimensions, landscaping deficiencies, and site paving, if deemed reasonable by the zoning administrator. 
5.  The establishment of a use identified in Section 17.16.200(C)(3) shall require approval of a conditional use permit regardless of whether or not a new building or building expansion is proposed, and shall be reviewed for consistency with the provisions of the MSO and Section 17.44.050. 
6.  The establishment of a use identified in Title 17 as a conditional use within the applicable base zoning district regulations, that is to be established within an existing building or site that does not involve new construction or a building expansion, and that is not subject to the provisions of the MSO, shall be regulated as a conditional use and shall comply with the procedures for all conditional uses outlined in Section 17.44.050 and the base zoning district regulations per this title. Approval may be conditioned upon the correction of nonconforming site conditions such as, but not limited to, deficiencies associated with required parking and parking dimensions, landscaping deficiencies, and site paving, if deemed reasonable. 
7.  The use and expansion of single-family residences shall be exempt from the provisions of the MSO, unless or until such properties are redeveloped or converted for nonresidential use. 
8.  Where a proposed use or development activity does not require review under the MSO per subsections (1) through (7), above, an applicant may request review under the provisions of the MSO at their discretion. In such instances, all provisions of the MSO district shall apply. 
9.  The establishment of a use identified in Section 17.16.200(C)(4) shall be prohibited in the MSO regardless of whether or not a new building or building expansion is proposed. 
C.  Land Use Regulations: The following regulations establish land uses allowed within the Main Street corridor overlay district: 
1.  Permitted by right: Not applicable. 
2.  Special use regulations: Unless otherwise specified herein, all uses allowed in the base zoning district applicable to any specific property shall be allowed in the MSO as special uses and shall comply with the procedures for all special uses outlined in Section 17.44.040, provided that they also comply in full with the site and building design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section, as determined by the zoning administrator. Furthermore: 
a.  Land uses or development proposals that require only one variation from the site or building design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section may be approved through the special use permit process provided the zoning administrator finds that the proposed alternative compliance provisions to mitigate the variation are satisfactory. 
b.  Mixed-use developments and mixed-use buildings may be considered as special uses under this section, provided that commercial uses are located on the ground level of Main Street facing facades. 
c.  Senior housing facilities may be considered as special uses under this section. 
3.  Conditional use regulations: Unless otherwise specified herein, all uses allowed in the base zoning district applicable to any specific property in the MSO, but that do not fully comply with the site and building design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section, may request approval as a conditional use and shall be subject to the alternative compliance provisions contained in subsection (F) of this section. All uses reviewed under this section shall also comply with the procedures for all conditional uses outlined in Section 17.44.050. In addition, the following uses and activities shall be permitted only by conditional use: 
a.  Multifamily residential buildings; 
b.  Tattoo or body piercing establishments, subject to the standards contained within Section 17.16.100(R) of this title;

a.  Sexually oriented land uses. 
b.  Outdoor maintenance service. 
c.  Outdoor storage. 
d.  Outdoor commercial entertainment. 
e.  Boarding house. 
f.  Parking lot as a principal use, excluding municipal parking. 
g.  Commercial dog day care. 
h.  Animal boarding. 
D.  Site Design Standards: The following site design standards are the minimum standards for site development and redevelopment within the MSO boundary. Unless otherwise specified herein, all development and redevelopment proposed within the MSO shall meet the following standards, or shall be subject to the alternative compliance provisions of subsection (F) herein. Building additions and remodels that are subject to compliance under this section may be exempted from some standards, if determined by the zoning administrator to be inapplicable or unreasonable due to existing site layout or conditions. 
1.  A "build-to" zone of five to twenty (20) feet from the right-of-way along Main Street and all side streets intersecting with Main Street shall be met on each site to encourage buildings to have a strong visual presence along Main Street and at intersections. Greater setbacks may be required when the city engineer determines that more sight visibility at an intersection is necessary. In addition, one of the following parameters must be met: 
a.  Buildings within the build-to zone shall occupy at least one-half of the buildable width of the lot along Main Street. Required side yard setbacks and driveways, if any, may be excluded from the buildable width calculations; or 
b.  At least one-third of the land area within the build-to zone along Main Street shall be occupied by buildings. Required side yard setbacks and driveways, if any, may be excluded from the build-to area calculations; 
c.  Under either option, private outdoor cafes, seating patios, and similar features may be counted as building area for the purposes of this section, provided they abut a building or buildings on the site. 
2.  Parking shall be located behind buildings and alongside buildings, and shall not be located closer to Main Street than the front facade of the principal structure on a lot, except as provided in subsection (3)(c) of this section. 
3.  Parking lots shall be buffered along the street edge/sidewalk with a landscaped edge that meets one of the following criteria: 
a.  A landscaped area of at least ten (10) feet in width containing a minimum of 0.5 plant unit per one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage; 
b.  A landscaped area of at least five feet in width containing a continuous hedge of twenty-four (24) to thirty-two (32) inches in height or a minimum of 1.0 plant unit per one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage; or 
c.  A landscaped area of less than five feet in width, or of any width if the parking area is to be located closer to the street than the principal building on the lot, if a decorative masonry wall or a combination decorative metal fence with shrubs is provided between the parking lot and the sidewalk. In no case shall said decorative wall or fence be located closer than two feet from the public sidewalk. If the decorative metal fence with landscaping option is implemented, adequate impervious area must be provided for the landscape plantings. A landscaped area of less than five feet in width is not recommended due to issues related to maintenance, snow removal and limited growing area for landscaping, and should only be used when other options are not practical. 
4.  When located adjacent to a residentially zoned property, a minimum five-foot landscaped area that includes a six-foot high screening fence and 1.0 plant unit per one hundred (100) feet shall be required along said property line. An alternative buffer may be negotiated with the adjacent landowner if an alternative to the six-foot high fence is desired. 
5.  Site design and layout shall occur in a manner that allows cross access between sites to occur over time, unless site conditions such as topography make such connections impractical. Ideally, cross access would be established at the time of redevelopment or site modifications provided that the adjacent landowner is willing to participate. At a minimum, easement agreements shall be recorded for the benefit of the city and adjacent properties to allow cross access to be accommodated in the future. Cross access easements should be located a sufficient distance from Main Street so as to not cause turning conflicts that could impact traffic flow on Main Street or at a drive entrance, and should be designed to discourage cut-through traffic while still allowing mid-block circulation. The easement shall specify that the owner of the subject property shall share in the cost of the cross access drive when it is installed in the future. Said easement agreements may include provisions for the property owner to request review of the proposed cross access drive by the plan commission and city council at the time a future cross access connection is to occur, to allow consideration of concerns related to shared parking, the nature of the adjacent use, or other factors prior to installation of the cross access drive. 
6.  Pedestrian connections from building entries to the street sidewalks along Main Street and side streets shall be provided. 
7.  Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided across drive-thru lanes and other main internal drives to provide safe access for pedestrians between parking areas and building entries. 
8.  Drive-thru lanes shall not be located between the building and a street right-of-way unless approved as a conditional use under subsection (C)(3) of this section. Screening of drive-thru lanes to address headlights shining into street traffic lanes or nearby residential properties shall be provided. Menu boards, ATMs and vehicle idling areas shall be located a sufficient distance away from property lines so as not to be a nuisance to adjacent residential properties, and shall meet the noise standards contained in Section 17.36.090 of this title. 
9.  Loading and delivery areas shall be provided on-site, and shall not be located between the principal building and the street. Loading docks shall be screened with landscaping or a decorative wall when visible from a public right-of-way or adjacent properties. 
10.  Refuse collection areas shall be located toward the rear of the site to the extent practical, and shall be enclosed with a six-foot high enclosure constructed of decorative materials that are similar to or compatible with the materials used on the principal structure on the site. When attached to or located within the principal building, they shall be designed so as to appear to be an integrated component of the building. A portion of the required landscaping for the site per Chapter 17.32 of this title shall be provided in areas adjacent to the enclosure. 
11.  Fueling areas and canopies associated with convenience stores/gas stations shall not be located between the principal building and the street, but rather behind or alongside the building. On corner lots, the principal building shall be located at the corner, with the fueling area along Main Street or the side street, and located no closer to the street than the principal structure. Fueling areas shall be treated as parking lots for the purpose of required screening, and shall meet the standards contained in subsections (2) through (4) of this section. 
12.  Outdoor mechanical equipment and meters shall be placed so as not to be highly visible from the adjacent street(s), and shall be screened with landscaping or a decorative wall that is compatible with the architecture of the principal building. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened with parapets or other decorative feature that is compatible with the architecture of the building. 
13.  In addition to signs permitted per Chapter 17.40, businesses located within the MSO shall be permitted to install one projecting sign per storefront, provided: 
a.  Each projecting sign shall meet the standards contained in Chapter 17.40; 
b.  Projecting signs shall only be allowed within the build-to zone. 
14.  Outdoor vending machines are permitted only as accessory uses on properties whose principal use is a commercial use. Vending machines do not require a zoning permit, but may need an electric permit or other approvals. Vending machines must abut an exterior wall of a building containing a commercial use, and shall be placed in an area that provides safe pedestrian access that is clear from vehicle circulation drives and parking areas. 
E.  Building Design Standards: The following building design standards are the minimum standards for new buildings and building additions within the MSO boundary. Unless otherwise provided herein, all development and redevelopment proposed within the MSO shall meet these standards, or shall be subject to the alternative compliance provisions of subsection (F) herein. Said standards apply to all new construction. Building additions and remodels may be exempted from some standards, if it is determined by the zoning administrator that alternative standards are more appropriate for the specific situation. 
1.  Primary building materials shall consist of high quality, long lasting materials such as brick, stone, stained or finished decorative concrete block, wood, or fiber cement materials. At least sixty percent (60%) of the surface area of building facades facing public streets or customer parking and circulation areas, excluding window openings and customer entrance doorways and associated trim, shall consist of the above building materials. Street facade treatments shall continue along side elevations to at least the first logical transition point or building offset as appropriate based on building architecture. 
2.  Accent materials may consist of any materials listed above in subsection (1) as acceptable primary materials, as well as glass, decorative metal finishes, decorative composite materials, stucco or acceptable stucco-like products, and similar products that are deemed acceptable by the zoning administrator. 
3.  Pitched roofs and eaves shall be finished in a traditional manner, with asphalt shingles, other decorative shingles, or standing seam metal roof materials, and eaves and soffits of typical materials and dimensions. Integrated metal roof and soffit systems that contain features such as excessively high fascia profiles shall not be allowed. Alternative designs and materials may be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
4.  Flat roofs shall be finished with a decorative cornice along street facades. Parapets shall be provided as needed to augment the architecture of the building and effectively screen rooftop mechanical equipment from view from the street and surrounding properties at ground level, although other rooftop screening methods may also be acceptable. 
5.  A minimum percentage of the first-floor building wall facing Main Street, measured between two and eight feet above the finished grade of the site, shall consist of transparent glass that provides visual access into the interior space of the building to a depth of at least four feet. 
a.  For most commercial and institutional uses, the minimum area of transparent glass shall be fifty percent (50%). 
b.  For clinics, medical or dental offices, or other uses where customer privacy is necessary, the minimum area of transparent glass shall be thirty percent (30%). 
c.  For buildings with residential units on the ground level, the minimum area of transparent glass shall be thirty percent (30%). 
d.  Alternative architectural solutions that continue the rhythm of windows established on the building may be included in lieu of up to fifty percent (50%) of the transparent glass requirement, if deemed acceptable by the zoning administrator. 
6.  At least one customer entrance, with appropriate architectural emphasis, shall be provided on the Main Street side of the building. As an alternative, an entrance on a side facade that is located within fifteen (15) feet of the Main Street facade may be used to satisfy this requirement if architectural projections such as a decorative canopy, a projecting vestibule, or other architectural element is provided in association with the entry. 
7.  Street facing facades greater than fifty (50) feet in length shall contain variations in vertical elevation at the roofline and shall incorporate either of the following measures to provide variety and visual interest along the street side of the building: 
a.  Wall plane projections or recesses along the facade, with offsets in each instance of six inches or greater, creating building bays of no more than thirty-two (32) feet in width; or 
b.  Architectural treatments that reflect a regular storefront rhythm along the facade of the building of no more than thirty-two (32) feet in width. 
8.  New buildings shall incorporate a building base of at least two feet in height that consists of durable materials such as stone, brick or decorative concrete block, as well as architectural articulation along the eave or roofline, on all building facades. 
9.  The minimum height of one-story buildings shall be eighteen (18) feet as measured from the sidewalk elevation to the top of the cornice or parapet on a flat roof building, or to the midpoint between the eave line and peak on a pitched roof. 
10.  The minimum ground floor height of commercial and office spaces shall be twelve (12) feet as measured from the finished floor to the finished ceiling, and ten (10) feet for ground floor residential uses in order to accommodate future conversion or adaptation for nonresidential use. 
11.  Building colors shall be limited to earth tones and muted accents that complement the primary materials of the building. Corporate colors and bright accents shall be limited to signs that fall within the wall sign parameters of the zoning ordinance. 
F.  Alternative Compliance: Any proposal being reviewed under subsection (C)(3) of this section shall be subject to the alternative compliance provisions contained herein. To offset any waivers or reductions in any of the site and design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section, offsetting features such as those listed herein may be considered. Acceptance of proposed offsetting features shall be at the discretion of the plan commission and common council upon a report and recommendation from the zoning administrator. 
1.  Potential offsetting features: The following features may be proposed to mitigate a proposed variation from the site and building design standards contained herein. Potential mitigating measures may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
a.  The use of a garden wall or decorative fencing, in combination with higher than required levels of landscaping at the parking lot edge along Main Street, may be used to offset parking lot design and location or building placement standards. 
b.  Attractively designed and articulated vertical elements that act as focal points may be incorporated into the building architecture to offset building design or building placement standards. 
c.  A higher percentage of street side windows along Main Street that provide visual access into the interior of the building may be provided to offset building design standards. 
d.  The incorporation of privately maintained "public" space along Main Street or a side street, such as a seating area, plaza, or unique landscape area, may be provided to offset any of the building or site design standards. Such features shall be designed in such a manner as to provide adequate visibility of all areas from the primary building on the property as well as the street and sidewalk. The designation of such spaces by easement for use by the public as a future transit stop may also be considered as an offsetting feature. Provisions to ensure that such areas are well maintained in the future, such as a performance agreement that provides for the city to step in and maintain the area in the event the property owner fails to do so, and pass maintenance costs plus administrative fees on to the property owner, may be required. 
e.  Decorative paving of on-site pedestrian walkways, parking lot crosswalks, or other paved areas on the site may be used to offset any of the building or site design standards. 
f.  Additional stormwater management provided on-site or underground, where deemed appropriate and of particular benefit by the city engineer to address known stormwater issues, may be provided to offset any of the building or site design standards. 
g.  The provision of public art or a monument located such that it can be viewed from Main Street or the sidewalk along Main Street may be used to offset any of the building or site design standards. 
h.  The incorporation of green site and building technologies, such as pervious pavement options, green roofs, solar or geothermal systems, etc., may be proposed to offset any of the building or site design standards. 
i.  Other potential offsetting features may be proposed for consideration and shall be reviewed under the criteria established in subsection (F)(2) of this section. 
2.  Review of proposed offsetting features: The consideration of potential offsetting features shall be considered by the plan commission and city council based upon the following criteria: 
a.  Does the proposed offsetting feature(s) provide some benefit to the public, including pedestrians and motorists along Main Street? 
b.  Does the proposed offsetting feature(s) improve the appearance and aesthetic experience of the site as viewed from Main Street? 
c.  Does the proposed offsetting feature(s) or resulting development provide something unique or of specific interest that may draw additional customers to the MSO? 
d.  Overall, does the benefit offered by the proposed offsetting feature(s) meet or exceed any potential negative effects of the proposed site or building design feature(s) being proposed to be waived or reduced? 
G.  Compliance With Approved Plans: Any development approved in the Main Street overlay district under this section, as either a special use or a conditional use, that is deemed by the zoning administrator to be out of compliance with plans approved under this section shall be subject to revocation under the procedures outlined in Section 17.44.050(H) of this title.

17.16.210 - Main Street live-work overlay (LWO) district regulations. 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of this section is to aid in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the West Main Street corridor plan, a component of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan, to encourage the continued residential use or the high quality reuse, redevelopment or revitalization of lands located within the Main Street live-work overlay district as established on Sheet 6 of the official zoning map per Section 17.12.190 of this title. The primary intended uses within the LWO include the continued occupancy of existing single-family residences or small multifamily buildings, and the reuse or partial reuse of existing residential properties for small office or small retail or professional service uses. New construction that approximates the scale and rhythm of the existing streetscape is also appropriate in the LWO. The LWO recognizes the importance of this segment of Main Street as a transition area between the traditional downtown located to the east of the district, and the commercial corridor to the west of the district. 
B.  Applicability: The provisions of this section shall provide the primary use, development and redevelopment regulations for properties located within the Main Street live-work overlay district boundary, and supersede other development regulations and standards contained within this title. The land use regulations of Chapter 17.16, the density and intensity regulations of Chapter 17.20, the bulk regulations of Chapter 17.24, the landscaping regulations of Chapter 17.32, the performance standards of Chapter 17.36, and the sign regulations of Chapter 17.40 shall all apply to properties located within the Main Street live-work overlay district boundary, unless otherwise regulated by this section. 
C.  Permitted/Prohibited Uses: The following regulations establish land uses allowed within the Main Street live-work overlay district: 
1.  Permitted by right: Any existing residential, office or commercial use located within the LWO and established prior to (January 6, 2011) shall be considered a conforming use and shall be permitted to be continued in its current configuration and intensity. In addition, the following activities are permitted by right: 
a.  Existing single-family homes shall be permitted to expand provided the expansion meets the dimensional requirements of the base zoning district and does not involve the creation of additional dwelling units. 
b.  Multi-unit residential buildings shall be allowed to be modified to reduce the number of dwelling units within the structure by right, provided any modifications to the exterior of the building do not involve building additions or major alterations to the Main Street façade of the building. 
c.  The addition of a garage or other accessory building associated with an existing residential building shall be permitted provided that the accessory building is similar to the principal building in terms of architecture and materials, and meets all dimensional requirements of the base zoning district, unless modified by the standards contained herein. 
d.  Residential structures currently being used for commercial or office uses shall be permitted to be converted back to a single-family use. 
2.  Special use regulations: Unless otherwise specified herein, the following activities may be permitted with the approval of a special use permit, provided that they also comply in full with the site and building design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section: 
a.  Any change in use involving either the full conversion of the building or any portion of the building, provided the proposed use is permitted within the base zoning district regulations and is not listed as a prohibited use per Section 17.16.210(C)(4). 
b.  The expansion of existing buildings or uses, or construction of new buildings within the LWO that do not involve combining, dividing or reconfiguring existing lots. 
c.  Mixed-use arrangements where a portion of the building, whether located on the ground floor or upper floor(s), is used for residential purposes. 
d.  Permanent or temporary outdoor display and sales as an accessory use, provided the display area does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the land area located within thirty (30) feet of Main Street. 
e.  Land uses or development proposals that require only one variation from the site or building design standards contained in subsections (D) and (E) of this section may be approved through the special use permit process, provided the zoning administrator finds that the proposed design meets the general intent of the LWO district. 
3.  Conditional use regulations: Unless otherwise specified herein, all uses allowed in the base zoning district applicable to any specific property in the LWO, except those specifically prohibited herein, but that do not qualify for approval as a permitted use or a special use under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, may request approval as a conditional use. Consideration of a conditional use permit request submitted under this section shall take into account the proposal's consistency with the intent of the LWO district and the compatibility of the proposed use and improvements with surrounding properties. 
4.  Prohibited uses: The following uses shall be prohibited within the LWO: 
a.  Sexually oriented land uses. 
b.  Outdoor maintenance service. 
c.  Outdoor storage.

a.  For new buildings, the front wall of the building shall be located within five feet of the average of the setbacks on the two adjacent properties, but shall extend no closer to the street than the closest of the adjacent structures or five feet, whichever is greater. 
b.  Building additions are discouraged on the street side of existing structures. Such additions that extend toward the street require review as a conditional use per subsection (C)(3) of this section. When allowed, such additions may encroach no more than twenty percent (20%) closer than the average of the setbacks of the two adjacent properties, and no closer to the street than the closest of the adjacent structures or five feet, whichever is greater. 
c.  Open front porches and stoops that are no more than one story in height may encroach into the front setback by up to five feet, and may include a roof. However, a minimum five-foot setback must be maintained. 
2.  Parking is encouraged to be located behind or along the side of buildings to the extent possible. For existing buildings with deep setbacks, up to fifty percent (50%) of an existing front yard may be paved for parking when existing residential buildings are converted or partially converted for nonresidential use, provided that no paving is located within fifteen (15) feet of the Main Street right-of-way and 0.5 plant units per one hundred (100) feet of frontage is provided within the setback area. All vehicle maneuvering shall be accommodated on-site, with no backing into the public street from on-site parking spaces. 
3.  Parking areas containing more than four parking spaces shall be screened from adjacent residentially zoned properties by a minimum five-foot landscaped area that includes a six-foot high fence and 1.0 plant unit per one hundred (100) feet along the property line. An alternative buffer may be negotiated with the adjacent landowner if an alternative to the six-foot high fence is desired. 
4.  Single-lane drives to rear yard parking areas shall be permitted when existing buildings are changed in use. However, such drives should be widened to two lanes near the street where possible to allow vehicles to pass while entering and exiting the site. 
5.  Wall signs shall be permitted per Chapter 17.40. In addition, one freestanding monument sign shall be permitted per property. Said sign shall consist of materials and colors that are compatible with the principal building on the site, and shall be further regulated, as follows: 
a.  The structure holding the sign shall be no more than eight feet in height, with the signable area of the sign limited to six feet in height; 
b.  The signable area of the sign shall be limited to twenty-four (24) square feet per side; 
c.  No internally lit signs shall be permitted; 
d.  All other provisions of Chapter 17.40 of this title shall be adhered to. 
6.  Refuse containers and/or dumpsters shall be located toward the rear of the site, and containers over ninety-five-gallon capacity shall be screened with a six-foot high enclosure. If located adjacent to residentially zoned or used property the enclosure shall meet the setback and landscaping requirements for parking areas described in subsection (D)(3) of this section. A portion of the required landscaping for the site per Chapter 17.32 of this title shall be provided in area adjacent to the enclosure. 
7.  Site lighting shall be downcast and shielded to minimize impacts on adjacent residentially zoned or used properties. Fixtures on poles or mounted on structures should be no higher than fifteen (15) feet above grade. 
8.  Outside mechanical equipment and meters shall not be located on the street side of the building. When visible from the right-of-way such items shall be screened with landscaping or a decorative screening wall. 
9.  Outdoor vending machines are permitted only as accessory uses on properties whose principal use is a commercial use. Vending machines do not require a zoning permit, but may need an electric permit or other approvals. Vending machines must abut an exterior wall of a building containing a commercial use, and shall be placed in an area that provides safe pedestrian access that is clear from vehicle circulation drives and parking areas. 
E.  Building Design Standards: The following building design standards are the minimum standards for new buildings and building additions within the LWO boundary. 
1.  New buildings shall be limited to two and one-half stories or thirty (30) feet, whichever is greater. Building additions shall be no taller than the existing structure being added to. 
2.  New buildings shall be gable or hipped roof structures that are compatible in scale, massing and pitch with existing buildings in the district. Building additions shall utilize similar roof styles and pitches as those found on the existing building, or alternative designs that are compatible with the existing building design as determined by the zoning administrator. 
3.  Primary building materials for new structures shall consist of high quality, long-lasting materials such as brick, stone, stucco or acceptable stucco-like products, wood, or fiber cement materials. Building additions and accessory buildings shall be constructed of materials that are compatible with the existing building. 
4.  New buildings shall have a residential appearance in terms of their overall scale, massing and design details. 
F.  Compliance With Approved Plans: Any development approved in the live-work overlay district under this section, as either a special use or a conditional use, that is deemed by the zoning administrator to be out of compliance with plans approved under this section shall be subject to revocation under the procedures outlined in Section 17.44.050(H) of this title.

Chapter 17.20 - DENSITY AND INTENSITY REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.20.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to indicate the maximum permitted density (for residential projects) and maximum permitted intensity (for nonresidential projects) of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this title (see Section 17.04.080). The development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 1) the area of the site; 2) the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources; 3) the zoning district(s) in which the site is located; 4) the development option(s) the site is developed under; and 5) the use(s) considered for development. 
B.  Rationale: This chapter regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this title. This chapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan. (See also, Section 17.04.050 of this title.) Many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques, particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities, and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments. Such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options, which in turn results in land use inefficiencies, forced site planning, and/or the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources. The approach employed by this chapter, relying on maximum gross densities (MGDs) and minimum green space ratios (GSRs) for residential development, and minimum required landscape surface ratios (LSRs) in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios (FARs) for nonresidential development, (both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district) results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives. (Prior code § 13-5-1) 
17.20.020 - How to use this chapter. 
    This chapter contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site. Prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the development potential of a given property, the guidelines provided by Section 17.20.060(A) through (C) should be reviewed. This chapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses, and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners. The description of the process addressing residential development in subsections 17.20.060(A) and (B) refers to the requirements of Section 17.20.040, residential density standards. The description of the process addressing nonresidential development in subsections 17.20.060(A) and (B) refers to the requirements of Section 17.20.050, nonresidential intensity standards. (Prior code § 13-5-2) 
17.20.030 - Required natural resources site evaluation. 
A.  Purpose. An important goal of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development and/or other land use activities. These resources include: floodplains, wetlands, waterways, shorelands, steep slopes, woodlands, hilltops, and native prairies. (These resources are defined in Chapter 17.28.) These resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development and/or other land use activities, in the absence of correct mitigation approaches. In many instances, these functions cannot be provided by other natural or man-made features. Specific broad categories of such functions include the: protection and enhancement of air, surface water, ground water, and soil quality; habitat provision and diversification; aesthetic diversification; and buffering effects. 
B.  Mitigation. In certain instances, natural features can accommodate development and/or other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed. (Chapter 17.28, natural resource protection regulations, provides detailed standards regarding permitted mitigation techniques and requirements.)

Key to Table 17.20.050 
Zoning District regulates the type of uses permitted on the site. Section 17.12.050 describes each zoning district. Table 17.16.030 provides a detailed listing of all uses permitted in each zoning district. Sections 17.12.050 and 17.12.060 provide detailed regulations applying to specific land uses. Zoning districts are depicted on the official zoning map. (See Section 17.12.030.) 
Maximum Floor Area Ratio is the maximum permitted ratio calculated by dividing the total gross flood area of all buildings on the site by the gross site area (GSA). "Gross floor area" is defined in Section 17.08.040. 
Minimum Building Size is the maximum total gross floor area which a building is permitted to contain. "Gross floor area" is defined in Section 17.08.040. 
Maximum Number of Floors is the maximum number of full floors a building is permitted to contain. "Full floors" is defined in Section 17.08.040. 
Minimum Landscape Surface Area Ratio is the minimum permitted percentage of the gross site area (GSA) which must be preserved as permanently protected landscaped area. LSR is calculated by dividing the total landscaped area of a site by the gross site area (GSA). GSA is calculated in Section 17.20.030(C)(1). "Landscaped area" is defined in Section 17.08.040.

17.20.060 - Detailed instructions for Chapter 17.20. 
A.  For Both Residential, and Nonresidential, Development. 
1.  Check Planning Recommendations for the Subject Property. 
a.  Check Comprehensive Plan Recommendations. The city's comprehensive plan should be checked for implications related to the subject property, particularly: Map 11-3, preferred future land use; Map 12-4, functional classification of roads; Map 13-1, preferred growth areas; and Map 13-3, staged development plan for public facilities. (Copies of the plan are available at the city's planning department. Complete plans are sold at cost, summaries are free of charge.) From time to time, this plan may be amended. The city's planning department should be consulted regarding changes to the plan which may effect the subject property or its environs. 
b.  Check Official Map Recommendations. The city's official map should be checked for proposed capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools, parks, stormwater management facilities and street improvements which may affect the subject property. The official map is on display at the city's planning and engineering departments. From time to time this map may be amended. The city's planning and engineering departments should be contacted regarding changes to the map which may effect the subject property or its environs. 
2.  Check the Zoning of the Subject Property. The potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located. The subject property should be identified on the city's official zoning map (see Section 17.12.030), and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in Section 17.12.050. The official zoning map is on display at the city's planning department. From time to time, the official zoning map may be amended. The zoning administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the map which may effect the subject property or its environs. 
3.  Complete a Natural Resources Site Evaluation for the Site. The effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated. All resources listed in Section 17.20.030, required natural resources site evaluation, should be identified on the subject property, located on a map (or air photo) of the subject property, and the total area of the property (in acres) covered by those resources, known as required resource protection area (RPA) should be determined, as should the gross site area (GSA) and the net developable area (NDA) of the subject property. (Subsection 17.20.030(C) contains a worksheet to simplify these calculations.) The city planner should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations. 
B.  For Residential Development. For Steps (1) through (3), see subsection A of this section. Section 17.20.040 contains a key to assist with the procedure described below. 
4.  Determine What Types of Dwelling Units are Permitted. The Table of Uses (Section 17.16.030) should be checked to determine which types of dwelling units are permitted within the zoning district present on, or proposed for, the subject property. Each dwelling unit listed in the table requires a particular minimum lot area (MLA) which is given in square feet to the right of the dwelling unit name. A complete description of each dwelling unit type, and their detailed lot, setback and development standards, is presented in Section 17.24.030. 
5.  Identify the Desired Permitted Development Option. The Table of Uses (Section 17.16.030) should be checked to determine which types of development options are permitted within the zoning district present on, or proposed for, the subject property. Each development option listed in the table permits different dwelling unit types. Care should be taken to ensure that the selected development options permit the desired dwelling unit types (see subsection (B)(4) of this section). Each development option is described in detail in Section 17.16.070. The selection of a particular development option may be related to the preponderance of sensitive natural resource areas on the site, or may reflect current or projected residential market conditions and the dwelling unit types they call for. After the desired permitted development option is identified, Section 17.20.040, residential density standards, should be referred to for a detailed listing of requirements for the selected development option in the identified zoning district(s). 
6.  Check Minimum Site Area Requirement Against Gross Site Area Present on the Subject Property. The required minimum site area (MSA), given in Section 17.20.040 (residential density standards) for the development option selected in (5), and in the zoning district identified in (2), should be compared with the gross site area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in Step (3) in subsection A of this section. If the GSA is less than the MSA required by the selected development option, then a development option requiring a lower degree of clustering must be selected (to reduce the required MSA), or additional property should be acquired. In other words, the GSA (from (3)) must be equal to or greater than the MSA (from (5)). 
7.  Check Green Space Ratio Requirement Against Required Resource Protection Area Present on the Subject Property. The required green space ratio (GSR), given in Section 17.20.040 (Residential Density Standards) for the development option selected in (5) and in the zoning district identified in (2), should be multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) used in Step (6), above. The resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space. This area should be compared with the required resource protection area (RPA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in Step (3) in subsection A of this section. If the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected green space required in the selected development option, then a development option requiring a higher degree of clustering may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential of the site. In other words, if the RPA (from (3)) is greater than the area required by the GSR (from (5)), a more clustered development option may permit the development of more dwelling units on the subject property. 
8.  Determine Maximum Gross Density Permitted on the Site. The maximum gross density (MGD), given in Section 17.20.040 (Residential Density Standards) for the development option selected in (5) and the zoning district identified in (2), above, should be noted. This number will be used in Step (9), below. 
9.  Determine the Maximum Number of Units Permitted on the Site. The maximum gross density (MGD), identified in (8), above, multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) calculated in Step (3), above, equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district. The ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site. 
10.  Check the Minimum Permitted Lot Area Against Table 17.16.030. The minimum lot area (MLA) requirement given in Section 17.20.040 (residential density standards), is the smallest size lot permitted within the selected development option within the selected zoning district. The MLA must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in Step (4), above. If the MLA given in Section 17.16.040 is larger than the lot size requirement given in Step (4), then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected (in which case, it may be advantageous to repeat Steps (4) through (10) using a different dwelling unit type and a different development option). 
    Rationale: Each residential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum gross density (MGD) depending upon the type of development option used. As the minimum required green space ratio (GSR) increases within each zoning district (based on the development option selected), the MGD increases. This density incentive is based on two principles: First, the combinations of MGD and GSR requirements for the various development options permitted within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district; second, the density incentive is designed to at least partially compensate for potential per-unit price reductions associated with smaller lot sizes in developments providing significant amounts of required green space. The minimum lot area (MLA) requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted gross densities are approachable, if not completely attainable, under efficient site design practices. Finally, the minimum site area (MSA) requirements ensure that development within any given zoning district maintains a homogeneous appearance. 
C.  Nonresidential Development. For Steps (1) through (3), see subsection A of this section. Section 17.20.050 contains a key to assist with the procedure described below. 
4.  Determine What Types of Land Uses are Permitted. The second and third pages of the Table of Uses (Section 17.16.030) should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district present on, or proposed for, the subject property. A complete description of each land use is presented in Sections 17.16.060 through 17.16.160. 
5.  Identify the Desired Development Option (Number of Floors). Section 17.20.050 (nonresidential intensity standards) presents a detailed listing of the development options available for nonresidential development in each zoning district. Each development option is based on a particular combination of maximum number of floors (#F), minimum landscape surface ratio (LSR), and maximum floor area ratio (FAR). The selection of a particular development option may be related to the presence of sensitive natural resource areas on the site, or may reflect current or projected nonresidential market conditions and the types of buildings they call for. 
6.  Check Minimum Lot Area Requirement Against Gross Site Area Present on the Subject Property. The required minimum lot area (MLA), given in Section 17.20.050 (nonresidential intensity standards) for the development option selected in (5), and in the zoning district identified in (2), should be compared with the gross site area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in Step (3), above. If the GSA is less than the MLA required by the selected development option, then additional property should be acquired. In other words, the GSA (from (3)) must be greater than or equal to the MLA (from (5)). 
7.  Check Minimum Landscape Surface Ratio Requirement Against the Required Resource Protection Area Present on the Subject Property. The required landscape surface ratio (LSR), given in Section 17.20.050 (nonresidential intensity standards) for the development option selected in (5), and in the zoning district identified in (2), should be multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) used in Step (6), above. The resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space. This area should be compared with the required resource protection area (RPA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in Step (3) of subsection A of this section. If the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required in the selected development option, then a development option requiring more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site. In other words, if the RPA (from (3)) is greater than the LSR (from (5)), a taller development option may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property. 
8.  Determine Maximum Floor Area Ratio Permitted on the Site. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) given in Section 17.20.050 (nonresidential intensity standards) for the development option selected in (5) and the zoning district identified in (2), of subsection A of this section, should be noted. This number will be used in Step (9), below. 
9.  Determine the Maximum Floor Area Permitted on the Site. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR), identified in (8), above, multiplied by the Gross Site Area (GSA) calculated in Step (3), above, equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property under that development option within that zoning district. The ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site. 
10.  Check the Maximum Building Size Requirement (NC District). The maximum building size (MBS) requirement given in Section 17.20.050, nonresidential intensity standards, is the largest size building permitted within the selected development option within the neighborhood commercial (NC) district. The MBS must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in Step (9), above. If the MBS given in Section 17.16.050 is smaller than the proposed building size calculated in Step (9) above, then a smaller building must be built, or the use of additional buildings should be considered. 
    Rationale: Each nonresidential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum floor area ratio (FAR) depending upon the type of development option used. As the minimum required landscape surface ratio (LSR) increases within each zoning district (based on the development option selected), the FAR increases. This intensity incentive is based on two principles: First, the combinations of FAR and LSR requirements for the various development options within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district; second, the intensity incentive is designed to compensate for potential per square foot price reductions associated with smaller FARs in developments providing significant amounts of required green space. The minimum lot area (MLA) requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted floor area ratios (FARs) are approachable, if not completely attainable, under efficient site design practices. Finally, the maximum building size (MBS) requirements ensure that development within the neighborhood commercial (NC) district retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale which is compatible with nearby residential development. (Prior code § 13-5-6) 
17.20.070 - Nonconforming development regulations. 
    A variance for any and all requirements of this chapter is automatically granted to all developments in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this title. However, after the effective date of this title such developments shall not be permitted to enlarge, expand or extend without bringing the enlargement, expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals per the requirements of Section 17.44.080. 
    Rationale: The "blanket variance" provision of this section is intended to prevent the creation of certain nonconforming developments within the jurisdiction of this title. The adoption of the provisions of this section ensures that developments approved prior to the adoption of this title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming. (Prior code § 13-5-7) 
Chapter 17.24 - BULK REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential developments. The provisions of this chapter interact closely with the provisions of Chapter 17.20, density and intensity regulations. 
(Prior code § 13-6-1) 
17.24.020 - How to use this chapter. 
    This chapter contains the standards which determine the location and height of buildings on any given site. Prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the potential layout of a given project, the recommendations provided below should be reviewed. 
    This chapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential projects, and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners. The description of the process addressing residential property in subsections A and B of this section, refers to the requirements of Section 17.24.030, residential bulk standards. The description of the process addressing nonresidential property in subsections A and C of this section, refers to the requirements of Section 17.24.040, nonresidential bulk standards. 
A.  For Both Residential and Nonresidential Development. 
1.  Identify the Zoning District and Development Option to Govern Development of the Subject Property. For buildable lots, the official zoning map should be consulted to determine the zoning of the subject property. For proposed developments, the operations required in Chapter 17.20 should be performed in order to identify the applicable zoning district and development option. Section 17.20.060 contains a detailed step-by-step description of the recommended procedure for determining the applicable zoning district and development option. 
2.  Note the Identified Zoning District and Development Option Applicable to the Subject Property. The applicable zoning district and development option identified for the subject property per subsection (1), above, should be noted. The development option for residential development determines the minimum lot area (MLA) permitted within the development. This is the key item of information for determining residential bulk regulations. The development option for nonresidential development determines the maximum number of floors (#F) permitted within the development. This is the key item of information for determining nonresidential bulk regulations. 
B.  For Residential Development. For Steps (1) and (2), see subsection A. of this section. 
1.  Determine the Type(s) of Dwelling Unit to be Used. Data for residential bulk standards are presented in a series of illustrations in Section 17.24.030, with each illustration pertaining to a specific dwelling unit type and its minimum lot size. The type(s) of dwelling unit(s) identified for use in subsection 1., above, should be used to identify the pertinent subsections of Section 17.24.030. 
2.  Identify the Bulk Standards for Each Dwelling Unit Type. Each page of Section 17.24.030 contains information for all bulk standards applicable to each dwelling unit type. All residential development within a proposed project must conform to the standards of Section 17.24.030, unless a variance is granted in accordance with Section 17.44.090 of this title. 
C.  For Nonresidential Development. For Steps (1) and (2), see subsection A. of this section. 
1.  Determine the Type(s) of Development Options to be Used. Data for all nonresidential bulk standards are presented in Table 17.24.040, with each row of the table pertaining to a specific zoning district and development option. The type(s) of development option(s) identified for use in subsection A.1. of this section should be used to identify the pertinent portions of Section 17.24.040. 
2.  Identify the Bulk Standards for Each Development Option. Each row of Table 17.24.040 contains information for all bulk standards applicable to each development option. All nonresidential development within a proposed project must conform to the standards of Section 17.24.040, unless a variance is granted in accordance with Section 17.44.090 of this title. 
(Prior code § 13-6-2) 
17.24.030 - Residential bulk standards. 
    All residential lots created under the provisions of this title shall comply with the standards of this section. These standards are related to the type of dwelling unit used, rather than to a specific zoning district. Table 17.16.030 and Table 17.20.040 relate each dwelling unit type to each zoning district and development option.

17.24.040 - Nonresidential bulk standards. 
    All nonresidential lots created under the provisions of this title shall comply with the standards of this section. These standards are related to the specific zoning district and development option used. Table 17.16.030 and Table 17.20.050 relate each use with each zoning district and development option. 
    Rationale: The maximum permitted height restrictions established are based upon the firefighting equipment available to the fire department as of the effective date of this title, the existing and planned character of neighborhoods within each zoning district, and the compatibility of a proposed use with existing similar uses within the city. Consideration to exceed the maximum building height limit may be made and approved through a conditional use permit if the following standards can be met: 
A.  The structure is equipped with internal firefighting mechanisms approved by the fire department or the fire department has firefighting equipment available to them to effectively fight a fire in the structure of the proposed height. 
B.  The proposed maximum building height does not exceed the maximum structure height allowed for that area of the city regulated by the "Height Limitation Zoning Map, Dane County Regional Airport, Madison, Wisconsin." 
C.  The proposed maximum building height is found to be compatible with existing and planned land uses adjacent to the subject site. 
    The following table, 17.24.040, presents the standards for nonresidential bulk regulations:

17.24.050 - Front yard or street yard setback adjustment. 
A.  The required front yard or street side yard setback for any use may be reduced for a principal structure on any lot where more than fifty percent (50%) of the same type of principal structure on the same block face or street face do not meet the required front yard setback. In such instances, the required front yard setback for the proposed structure shall be the average of all same type principal structures on such block face or street face. 
B.  A special use permit may be granted to reduce the front yard or street side yard setback requirement for a residential use along an arterial street, as established for each individual dwelling unit type in Section 17.24.030, to a dimension equal to or greater than the required front yard or street side yard setback for the same dwelling unit type along a collector street, provided the zoning administrator, upon consultation with the city engineer, determines that the following standards are being met: 
1.  A need for additional right-of-way for roadway expansion is not anticipated along the arterial street in the foreseeable future; 
2.  The proposed development will be generally consistent with the existing or proposed development along the same block face and in the surrounding area; and 
3.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.040, standards and procedures applicable to all special uses. 
C.  A special use permit may be granted to reduce the front yard or street yard setback requirement for a side-loaded attached garage, provided the zoning administrator determines that the following standards are being met; 
1.  At least fifteen percent (15%) of the street-facing facade of the garage consists of windows or pedestrian entryway doors; 
2.  Architectural details of the street-facing facade of the garage, such as window and door design and placement, trim details, and building materials, are consistent with the features of the living portion of the home; and 
3.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.040, standards and procedures applicable to all special uses. 
D.  If a requested front yard or street side yard setback reduction, listed as a special use above, cannot meet one of the special use requirements of subsection B., of this section, for reasons directly related to the nature of the subject property, the petitioner may request plan commission and city council review for approval as a conditional use, per the requirements of Section 17.44.050. No more than one special use requirement shall be waived in this manner for any given request. 
(Ord. 167, § 3, 12-21-2004; Ord. 74, § 1, 2003; prior code § 13-6-5) 
17.24.060 - Side yard setback adjustment. 
    The minimum required side yard setback listed for single-family detached houses of nine thousand (9,000) square feet and lot line houses (Section 17.24.060) are reduced for lots of record existing as of the effective date of this title. For both dwelling unit types, required minimum side yards shall be five feet for one-story dwellings and eight feet for two-story dwellings; and for both dwelling types, required total side yards shall be thirteen (13) feet for one-story dwellings and sixteen (16) feet for two-story dwellings. 
(Prior code § 13-6-6) 
17.24.070 - Rear yard setback reduction. 
    Certain residential dwelling unit types may qualify for a reduction in the required rear yard setback with the provision of a bufferyard to mitigate any potential adverse effects of the rear yard reduction on adjacent residential properties. 
A.  Such reduction shall permit the required rear yard setback to be reduced from thirty (30) feet to twenty (20) feet (from the rear lot line to the nearest point of the dwelling unit). 
B.  These units shall include the: single-family detached nine thousand (9,000) square foot lot house, lot line house, village house, twin house, duplex house, and two-flat house. 
C.  Prior to acquiring a building permit which indicates such reduction, the petitioner shall file an agreement with the recorder of deeds which requires the installation and continuous maintenance of such bufferyard. Such agreement shall specifically state that such requirements shall apply to any current or future owner or assign of the subject property. 
D.  Such bufferyard shall have a minimum opacity of two-tenths, and shall be located along the entire length of the rear lot line, and along both side lot lines a distance of thirty (30) feet from the rear lot line toward the front lot line, except as provided in subsections 1. and 2. below: 
1.  Where the abutting properties to the rear or side of the subject rear yard consist of uses such as cemeteries, schools, parkland, stormwater management facilities or other permanently protected green spaces, the plant units required to meet the landscaping component of the required bufferyard may be reduced by two-thirds, provided that the landscaping or landscape features provided are used in such a manner as to define the property line, thereby minimizing the potential for future encroachment of rear yard activities or mowing into the adjacent lands. 
2.  Where the provisions of subsection 1., above, do not apply, and the abutting properties are developed or zoned for nonresidential uses and are not planned for future residential use as per the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan, no bufferyard shall be required.

The following are permitted up to a maximum height of forty-five (45) feet in all rural and residential zoning districts and fifty (50) feet in all nonresidential zoning districts: church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes which do not contain useable space, public monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers, flagpoles, chimneys, cooling towers, elevator penthouses, and communication towers. Exhaust stacks are permitted up to a maximum height of eighty-five (85) feet in all industrial zoning districts. In zoning districts that allow for a greater maximum building height than stated in Section 17.24.040, the maximum building height for that zoning district applies to all structures within that respective zoning district. 
B.  Required Procedure for Exceeding Maximum Height Regulations. In order to secure permission to exceed the maximum height regulations of Sections 17.24.030 and/or 17.24.040, and/or the maximum number of floors regulations of Section 17.20.050, or the regulations of subsection A.2. of this section, the petitioner shall apply for and be granted a conditional use permit which specifically states the maximum permitted height and/or maximum permitted number of floors per the standards and procedures of Section 17.44.050, as well as the following standards: 
1.  The building shall be equipped with internal firefighting mechanisms as determined necessary by the fire department. 
2.  The requested height shall be compatible with surrounding existing or surrounding proposed or planned structure or building heights or shall be designed with a stepped roofline or similar design to minimize the difference in heights; or is otherwise so located in terms of distance or natural topography or screening from surrounding structures that the proposed increase in height will not detract from the area nor negatively impact adjoining land uses. 
3.  The request shall comply with the general purposes of the zoning ordinance, particularly those relating to provision of adequate light and air, including access to sunlight for solar collectors and to wind for wind energy systems, prevention of overcrowding, undue concentration of population, and security from fire, as well as the standards for conditional uses per Section 17.44.050, and any other neighborhood plan or adopted plan or policy governing development of the site.

17.24.095 - Exceptions to bulk standards, intensity standards, and landscape bufferyard regulations for nonresidential uses in the Urban Residential (UR-12) zoning district. 
A.  Permitted Exceptions to Bulk Standards, Intensity Standards, and Landscape Bufferyard Regulations for Nonresidential Uses in the Urban Residential (UR-12) Zoning District. 
1.  The standards for minimum lot width, minimum setbacks, and minimum building separation for nonresidential uses contained in Section 17.24.040, the minimum lot area, minimum landscape surface ratio, and maximum floor area contained in Section 17.20.050, and the landscaping requirements for bufferyards contained in Section 17.32.090 may be reduced through the approval of a conditional use permit provided that the city determines that the following standards are met: 
a.  The most recent use of the property and structure was a conforming or legally nonconforming nonresidential use; 
b.  The proposed use is listed as an allowed use within the zoning district in Section 17.16.030 Table of Land Uses; 
c.  The requested use is compatible with surrounding existing or surrounding proposed or planned land uses; 
d.  Exceptions or reductions from landscape bufferyard standards are kept to a minimum; 
e.  The public benefit resulting from flexibility in design standards must be justified versus the benefit of a private individual or entity; and 
f.  The standards for all conditional use permits contained in Section 17.44.050 are met. 
2.  Exceptions permitted under this section shall only be granted for existing buildings. 
3.  To avoid duplication of conditional use permit applications, if a proposed use already requires a conditional use permit, per Section 17.16.030 Table of Land Uses, then a request for the exceptions listed in this section may accompany such request. 
(Ord. 144, § 1, 6-1-2004) 
17.24.100 - Nonconforming lot regulations. 
A.  Except as provided in subsection C., below, upon and after the effective date of this title, no lot shall be created which does not meet the minimum lot area (MLA) requirements of Section 17.20.040 or 17.20.050 or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements of Section 17.24.030 or 17.24.040. 
B.  A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this title in a residential district (see Section 17.12.020), which does not meet the minimum lot area (MLA) requirements of Section 17.20.040 or 17.20.050 or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements of Section 17.24.030 or 17.24.040 may be utilized for a detached single-family dwelling unit, provided the measurements of such area and dimensions are equal to or greater than seventy percent (70%) of the requirements of this title. Such lot shall not be more intensively developed (with multifamily or nonresidential uses) unless combined with one or more abutting lots (or portions thereof) so as to create a lot which meets the requirements of this title. 
C.  A special use permit may be granted to accommodate lot adjustments to lots of record existing prior to March 16, 1989, that contain existing single-family or duplex uses, even if the resulting lot configuration does not meet the city's bulk standards of Section 17.24.030, the minimum lot area requirements of Section 17.20.040 or the minimum lot dimension requirements of Section 17.24.030. In such situations, the bulk standards, minimum lot area requirements or minimum lot dimension requirements may be reduced provided the zoning administrator determines that the following standards are being met: 
1.  The lot adjustment does not result in the creation of additional lots, nor will it facilitate the creation of additional dwelling units. 
2.  As a result of the adjustment, adequate area will be maintained on the lot to allow for maintenance and upkeep of all structures on the lot and to meet the Uniform Building Code. 
3.  The proposed lot pattern would be consistent with the lot pattern established for other single-family and/or two-family uses within the neighborhood. 
4.  The reduction in the bulk standards being proposed is determined to be the minimum necessary to facilitate the proposed adjustment. 
In the event that a special use permit is granted per this section, the lot adjustment shall be accomplished by certified survey map or subdivision plat. 
Rationale: Many of the lots that predate the current zoning ordinance, particularly in the older portions of the city, do not meet the current bulk standards, minimum lot area and minimum lot dimension requirements. Since these areas of the city were developed decades before the current standards were adopted, it is difficult to meet the more "suburban" lot standards contained in the current ordinance. The result has been a significant loss of flexibility for owners of homes in the city's older neighborhoods who wish to make a minor adjustment to their lot to reflect changing circumstances or desires for the property, even when such adjustments would result in lots that are still substantially consistent with the overall pattern of development within the neighborhood. This process was conceived to allow for city staff to review proposals for lot adjustments and approve such adjustments provided that certain standards are met and no negative impacts are anticipated as a result of the lot adjustment. 
(Ord. 267, § 1, 8-15-2006; prior code § 13-6-10) 
17.24.110 - Nonconforming structure and building regulations. 
A.  Any structure or building lawfully existing upon the effective date of this title may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as hereafter specified. 
B.  Nothing in this title shall preclude the building inspector from remedial or enforcement actions when such structure or building is declared unsafe. 
C.  When any lawful nonconforming structure or building in any district is modified so as to be in conformance with the provisions of this title, any future modification of such structure or building shall be in conformance with the provisions of this title. 
D.  Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure or building has been damaged by fire, flood, wind, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, unlawful act, or act of God, it may be reconstructed and used as before if it be reconstructed within one year after such calamity, unless the damage to such structure or building equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its assessed value. In such cases, the reconstruction shall be limited to uses permitted by the provisions of this title (unless the ability to re-establish a nonconforming use is specifically granted by council). 
E.  Normal maintenance of a nonconforming structure or building is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconformity. 
F.  Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming residential units, provided such alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building, except that a conforming garage may be added if none previously existed. 
G.  A legal, nonconforming garage may be enlarged or replaced provided the following requirements are met: 
1.  That the proposed garage replacement or addition does not encroach farther into required setback(s) than the current legal, nonconforming structure; 
2.  That the proposed garage replacement or addition does not locate closer to an existing residence on an adjacent parcel than the sum of the required garage setback (on the subject property) and the required house setback (on such adjacent parcel); 
3.  That exterior building materials and building styles match that of the original garage or the residence; 
4.  And that precautions (determined on a case-by-case basis by the building inspector) are taken to reduce the possibility of fire damage to nearby structures. 
H.  Any structure or building for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this title which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this title or amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the effective date of this title and provided that construction is completed within seven hundred thirty (730) calendar days of the effective date of this title or amendments thereto. Such structure or building shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure or building. 
I.  A variance for any and all requirements of this chapter is automatically granted to all nonconforming residential dwellings in their configuration existing as of the effective date of this title. However, after the effective date of this title, such structures shall not be permitted to enlarge, expand or extend without bringing the enlargement, expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of the chapter unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals per the requirements of Section 17.44.090. 
    Rationale: The "blanket variance" provision of subsection I of this section is intended to eliminate the continued classification and/or creation of certain nonconforming residential structures within the jurisdiction of this title. This provision addresses two different situations. First: prior to the provision of full-time inspection services, a number of residential structures were approved in the City of Sun Prairie which did not meet setback requirements. Second: this title requires greater side yard setback requirements for certain residential lot sizes than did previous regulations for similar sized lots. The adoption of the provisions of subsection I of this section ensure that residential structures approved prior to the adoption of this title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming uses. This "blanket variance" is not available for nonresidential structures.

17.24.120 - Exceptions to bulk standards, intensity standards and bufferyard regulations for the expansion of existing nonresidential uses in the Suburban Residential (SR-4), Mixed Residential (MR-8), and Urban Residential (UR-12) zoning districts. 
A.  Permitted Exceptions to Bulk Standards, Intensity Standards, and Landscape Bufferyard Regulations for Nonresidential Uses in the Suburban Residential-4 (SR-4), Mixed Residential-8 (MR-8), and Urban Residential (UR-12) Zoning Districts. 
1.  The standards for minimum lot width, minimum setbacks, and minimum building separation for nonresidential uses contained in Section 17.24.040, the minimum lot area, minimum landscape surface ratio, and maximum floor area contained in Section 17.20.050, and the landscaping requirements for bufferyards contained in Section 17.32.090 may be reduced through the approval of a conditional use permit provided that the city determines that the following standards are met: 
a.  The most recent use of the property and structure was a conforming or legally nonconforming nonresidential structure; 
b.  The proposed use is listed as an allowed use within the zoning district in Section 17.16.030, Table of Land Uses; 
c.  The requested use and building expansion is compatible with surrounding existing or surrounding proposed or planned land uses and buildings; 
d.  The front or street yard setback reduction shall not be reduced to less than twenty (20) feet. If reduced to twenty (20) feet, parking shall not be allowed in the front or street setback area; 
e.  The front or street yard setback shall not be reduced for street-facing garages; 
f.  Exceptions or reductions from the landscape bufferyard standards are kept to a minimum; 
g.  The architectural quality shall be compatible with existing building and the neighborhood; 
h.  The public benefit resulting from flexibility in design standards must be justified versus the benefit of a private individual or entity; and 
i.  The standards for all conditional use permits contained in Section 17.44.050 are met. 
2.  Exceptions permitted under this section shall only be granted for the expansion of existing buildings and/or a change of use within an existing building. 
3.  To avoid duplication of conditional use permit applications, if a proposed use already requires a conditional use permit, per Section 17.16.030 Table of Land Uses, then a request for the exceptions listed in this section may accompany such request.

Chapter 17.28 - ENVIRONMENTAL CORRIDOR: NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION REGULATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Section 5 of Ord. 228A, adopted January 17, 2006, amended the title of Ch. 17.28 to read as herein set out. 

17.28.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the requirements for the mandatory protection of natural and historic resources and permanently protected green space areas within the jurisdiction of this title (see Section 17.04.080). The provisions of this chapter interact closely with the provisions of Section 17.16.040 (uses permitted in other permanently protected green space areas), Section 17.16.160 (natural resource disruption and required mitigation standards), Section 17.20.030 (required natural resources site evaluation), and Sections 17.20.040 and 17.20.050 which provide residential and nonresidential development standards (including minimum required green space ratios (GSRs) and minimum required landscape surface ratios (LSRs). Section 17.20.060 provides a complete overview of the interrelationship between the above-listed sections. In part, the provisions of this chapter are designed to ensure the implementation of the City of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan, the environmental protection element of the Dane County regional development guide, and Sections 62.231, 62.23(7)(em), and 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Prior code § 13-7-1) 
17.28.020 - How to use this chapter. 
    This chapter contains the standards which govern the protection, disturbance, and mitigation of disruption of all natural and historic resources and other permanently protected green space areas. The provisions of this chapter are intended to supplement those of the City of Sun Prairie, Dane County, the State of Wisconsin, and the Federal Government of the United States which pertain to natural resource protection. Prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the permitted disruption of such areas, the requirements provided below should be reviewed. This chapter recognizes the important and diverse benefits which natural and historic resource features provide in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type, and is designed to accomplish several objectives: 
A.  First, a definition of the natural or historic resource is provided; 
B.  Second, the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural or historic resource type are provided; 
C.  Third, the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural or historic resource area is given; 
D.  Fourth, mandatory protection requirements are identified. 
    Note: Protection requirements for specific land uses and natural resource types designed to minimize disruption of natural resource functions are presented in Section 17.16.160. 
(Prior code § 13-7-2) 
17.28.025 - Environmental corridors. 
A.  Definition. Environmental corridors are continuous systems of open space in urban and urbanizing areas, that include environmentally sensitive lands and natural resources requiring protection from disturbance and development, and lands needed for open space and recreational use. They are based mainly on drainageways and stream channels, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, and other resource features, and are part of a countywide system of continuous open space corridors. Buffer zones for each environmental resource as defined in this section are considered a part of that specific resource. 

Environmental Corridor 
B.  Purpose of Environmental Corridor Protection Requirements. The objective is to delineate, in local and regional plans, those lands and resources, which perform important environmental functions and need to be protected from development and urbanization. Protection of these corridors in the community helps the city to protect lands needed for drainage and recreation; avoid problems from development on steep slopes, problem soils or flood-prone areas; protect water resources and avoid pollution; and enhance scenic beauty and wildlife habitat. Once delineated and adopted, the corridors are used by the city and state and federal agencies in making decisions on the location of urban development and major facilities. The corridors are also used as a basis or starting point for open space and recreation planning and acquisition. An important use of the corridors is in RPC/DNR review of sewer extensions and sewer service areas, to direct urban development to areas outside the corridors. 
C.  Determination of Environmental Corridor Boundaries. General environmental corridor boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. The Dane County Regional Planning Commission staff has worked with local units of government in Dane County to delineate the corridors, based on available information and mapping of environmental resources and open space lands (water bodies and drainageways, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, woodlands, areas of unique vegetation or geology, existing and proposed parks, etc.). All environmental corridors within urban service areas county-wide have been mapped. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property, which contains an environmental corridor depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all environmental corridor areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A of this section. 
D.  Mandatory Environmental Corridor Protection Requirements. Environmental corridors shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 for the specific "Permanently Protected Green Space" type and per the requirements of Section 17.16.160. 
1.  Buffer zone. A buffer zone is a vegetative strip of land adjacent to a stream, lake, or wetland, which serves as a protection for that water resource. Buffers moderate flow rates of stormwater runoff into receiving waters, stabilize banks and shorelines, filter nutrients and sediments from runoff, support fish habitat, provide habitat for other wildlife, and screen aesthetically unappealing land uses. Buffers can also serve to moderate stream temperatures, critical for some fish species such as trout. Buffer zones are established in this ordinance for wetlands, perennial streams, intermittent streams or open drainageways, and lakes, as shown on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. 
2.  Required minimum buffer zone widths for applicable environmental resources are listed in Table 17.28.025 D.2., below. 
Table 17.28.025 D.2. 
Minimum Buffer Zone Widths

*  Navigability of a stream must be determined by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
E.  Amendments to the Environmental Corridor. Amendments to the Environmental Corridor involve amending Sheet 2 of the City of Sun Prairie Official Zoning Map and procedures for amending the official zoning map, contained in Section 17.44.030 must be followed. The department of natural resources, regional planning commission, or other agencies may also need to be involved in the approval process. 
(Ord. 228A, § 6, 1-17-2006) 
17.28.030 - Floodplains. 
A.  Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose, Title and General Provisions. 
1.  Statutory Authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Sections 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in Section 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes 
2.  Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
3.  Statement of Purpose. This section is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
a.  Protect life, health and property; 
b.  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
c.  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
d.  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
e.  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
f.  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
g.  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
h.  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
i.  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
4.  Title. The ordinance from which this section is derived shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin." 
5.  General Provisions. 
a.  Areas to be Regulated: This section regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
b.  Official Maps and Revisions: The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes in the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see subsection H. Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the zoning administrator, city of Sun Prairie. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
i.  Official Maps: Based on the FIS: 
(a)  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel numbers 55025C0258H, 55025C0259H, 55025C0266H, 55025C0269H, 55025C0279H, 55025C0285H, 55025C0286H, 55025C0287H, 55025C0288H, dated September 17, 2014, and 55025C0267G, dated January 2, 2009; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) 55025CV001D, 55025CV002D, 55025CV003D, and 55025CV004D dated June 16, 2016. 
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
ii.  Official Maps: Based on Other Studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development. 
(a)  General floodplain boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the city of Sun Prairie Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property, which contains a floodplain depicted on this map and/or the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) identified in this title, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all floodway (FW), floodfringe (FF) and general floodplain (GFP) districts on the subject property. Unmapped floodplains do exist within the city. For these areas, the city may require a floodplain determination prior to the issuance of a permit for any work in such areas or prior to final approval of a land use application. These areas shall be considered floodplain and shall be labeled as such on subdivision plats, certified survey maps, and site plans. 
(b)  City of Sun Prairie Flood Storage District, Panel 3 of 21. Dated September 17, 2014. Prepared and approved by the WDNR. 
(c)  Letter of Map Revision (Case No. 15-05-4807P, effective February 12, 2016). 
c.  Establishment of Floodplain Zoning Districts: The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows: 
i.  The floodway district (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the FIRM. 
ii.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM. 
iii.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
iv.  The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
d.  Locating Floodplain Boundaries: Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs i. or ii. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to subsection H. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection. G.3.c. and the criteria in i. and ii. below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to subsection H. 
i.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
ii.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
e.  Removal of Lands From Floodplain: Compliance with the provisions of this section shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to subsection H. 
f.  Compliance: Any development or use within the areas regulated by this section shall be in compliance with the terms of this section, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
g.  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated: Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this section and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Section 30.2022, Wisconsin Statutes, applies. 
h.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: 
i.  This section supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Sections 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Section 62.23 for cities; Section 61.35 for villages; or Section 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
ii.  This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. 
i.  Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this section, required by ch. NR 116, Wisconsin Administrative Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this section or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section. 
j.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The flood protection standards in this section are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This section does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this section. 
k.  Severability: Should any portion of this section be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected. 
l.  Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages: The county floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wisconsin Administrative Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. 
B.  General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain Districts. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this section and all other requirements in subsection G.1.b. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
1.  Hydraulic and Hydrologic Analyses.

B.  Channel sections must be surveyed. 
C.  Minimum four foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping. 
D.  A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 
E.  The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used. 
F.  A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure. 
G.  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
H.  Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices.

A.  Duplicate Effective Model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot. 
B.  Corrected Effective Model. The corrected effective model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for department review. 
C.  Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 
D.  Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
E.  All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
F.  Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated. 
(3)  Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the department for review which meet the following conditions:

For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
61.  "Nonconforming structure" means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this section for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
62.  "Nonconforming use" means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this section for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the floodway.)

71.  "Regional flood" means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
72.  "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
77.  "Unnecessary hardship" means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.

17.28.040 - Wetlands. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Sections 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26, Wisconsin Statutes. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  Findings of Fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands, inland wetlands, and the pollution of the navigable waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control buildings sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
2.  Purpose. To promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, this chapter has been established to: 
a.  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; 
b.  Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters and to maintain storm and flood water capacity; 
c.  Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
d.  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the wetland area; 
e.  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
C.  Title of Chapter. Wetland Zoning Ordinance Chapter for the city of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 
D.  Compliance. The use of wetlands, and the alteration of wetlands within the city shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see subsection M of this section, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
E.  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Section 30.12(4)(a), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. 
1.  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any city zoning ordinance enacted under Sections 62.23 or 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes, which relate to wetlands, except that where another city zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
F.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. 
1.  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any city zoning ordinance enacted under Sections 62.23 or 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes, which relate to wetlands, except that where another city zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
G.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Chapter NR 117, Wisconsin Administrative Code, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
H.  Purpose of Wetland Zoning. This chapter is adopted to maintain safe and healthful conditions to prevent and control water pollution to protect fish spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life and wildlife habitat, to preserve shore cover and natural beauty and to control building and development in wetlands whenever possible. When development is permitted in a wetland, the development should occur in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland. 
I.  Official Wetland Zoning Maps. The following maps are adopted and made a part of this chapter and are on file in the office of the city clerk for the city of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin: 
1.  Wetland inventory map(s) stamped "Final" on July 1, 1986; 
2.  United States Geological Service Quadrangle Maps; 
3.  General wetland boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the city of Sun Prairie Official Zoning Map; 
4.  Flood hazard boundary maps. 
J.  District Boundaries. 
1.  The wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the city of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, which are shown on any federal or state wetland inventory map, Sheet 2 of the official zoning map, or as determined by field investigation. Wetland buffer zones are required for all wetlands within the city and its environs and shall meet the minimum standards outlined in Table 17.28.025 D.2. General wetland boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map: 
2.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
3.  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the wetland district boundary shown on the official wetland zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error. If the department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official wetland zoning maps, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a wetland map amendment within a reasonable period. 
4.  Upon the proposal of development activity on any property, which contains a wetland depicted on any of the official wetland zoning maps identified in this title, or as discovered through field investigation, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all wetlands on the subject property.

In the issuance of a variance, the purpose of the chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. No variance from the terms of this chapter shall be granted which is contrary to the public interest. A variance may be granted where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. The granting of a variance shall not have the effect of granting or extending any use of property which is prohibited in that zoning district by this chapter. 
3.  Appeals to the Board. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the community affected by any order, requirement decision, or determination of the zoning administrator or other administrative official.

The final disposition of an appeal or application to the board of appeals, shall be in the form of a written decision, made within a reasonable time after the public hearing, signed by the board chairperson. Such decision shall state the specific facts which are the basis of the board's determination and shall either affirm, reverse, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed, in whole or in part, dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction or persecution, or grant the application. 
b.  A copy of such decision shall be mailed to the parties in interest and the appropriate district office of the department within ten (10) days after the decision is issued. 
V.  Amending Wetland Zoning Regulations. The common council may from time to time, alter, supplement or change the district boundaries and the regulations contained in this chapter in accordance with the requirements of Section 62.23(7)(d)2, Wisconsin Statutes; NR 117, Wisconsin Administrative Code; and the following: 
1.  A copy of each proposed text or map amendment shall be submitted to the appropriate district office of the department within five days of the submission of the proposed amendment to the city planning agency. 
2.  All proposed text and map amendments to the wetland zoning regulations shall be referred to the city plan commission, and a public hearing shall be held as required by Section 62.23(7)(d)2, Wisconsin Statutes. The appropriate district office of the department shall be provided with written notice of the public hearing at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing. 
3.  In order to insure that the shoreland protection objectives in Section 144.26, Wisconsin Statutes, will be accomplished by the amendment, the common council may not rezone a wetland in a wetland zoning district, or any portion thereof, where the proposed rezoning may result in a significant adverse impact upon any of the following: 
a.  Storm and floodwater storage capacity; 
b.  Maintenance of dry season stream flow or the discharge of groundwater to a wetland, the recharge of groundwater from a wetland to another area or the flow of groundwater through a wetland; 
c.  Filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
d.  Shoreline protection against soil erosion; 
e.  Fish spawning, breeding, nursery or feeding grounds; 
f.  Wildlife habitat; 
g.  Areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific interest, including scarce wetland types and habitat of endangered species. 
4.  Where the district office of the department determines that a proposed rezoning may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the criteria listed in subsection C., of this section, the department shall so notify the city of its determination either prior to or during the public hearing held on the proposed amendment. 
5.  The appropriate district office of the department shall be provided with: 
a.  A copy of the recommendations and report, if any, of the city plan commission on the proposed text or map amendment, within ten (10) days after the submission of those recommendations to the common council; 
b.  Written notice of the common council's action on the proposed text or map amendment within ten (10) days after the action is taken; 
c.  If the department notifies the city plan commission in writing that a proposed amendment may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the criteria listed in subsection C., of this section, that proposed amendment, if approved by the common council, may not become effective until more than thirty (30) days have elapsed since written notice of the common council approval was mailed to the department, as required by subsection E., of this section. If within the thirty-day period, the department notifies the common council that the department intends to adopt a superseding wetland zoning ordinance for the city under Section 62.231(6), Wisconsin Statutes, the proposed amendment may not become effective until the ordinance adoption procedure under Section 62.231(6), Wisconsin Statutes, is completed or otherwise terminated. 
W.  Enforcement and Penalties. Any development, building or structure or accessory building or structure constructed, altered, added to, modified, rebuilt or replaced or any use or accessory use established after the effective date of this chapter in violation of the provisions of this chapter, by any person, firm, association, corporation (including building contractors or their agents) shall be deemed a violation. The zoning administrator shall refer violations to the common council and the city attorney who shall prosecute such violations.

(Ord. 228A, § 8, 1-17-2006; prior code § 13-7-4) 
17.28.050 - Shorelands. 
A.  Definition. "Shorelands" are lands within the following distances from the ordinary highwater mark of navigable waters: One thousand (1,000) feet from a lake, pond or flowage; three hundred (300) feet from a river or stream or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. 
B.  Purpose of Shoreland Protection Requirements. Shorelands serve to protect land/water margins from erosion due to site disruption. Because of regular contact with wave action, currents, and runoff, such areas are highly susceptible to continuous, and in some cases, rapid erosion. Shoreland protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy, and filters significant amounts of water-borne pollutants and sediments. Shorelands also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water margin. 
C.  Determination of Shoreland Buffer Zones. General shoreland boundaries are set forth in Table 17.28.025 D.2 and depicted on Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a shoreland depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all shoreland buffer areas on the subject property. This section does not apply to lands adjacent to an artificially constructed drainage ditch, pond or stormwater retention basin if the drainage ditch, pond or retention basin is not hydrologically connected to a natural navigable water body. 
D.  Zoning of Annexed Shoreland. All shorelands, including shorelands annexed to the City of Sun Prairie after May 7, 1982 that prior to annexation were subject to the Dane County Shoreland Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of annexation, shall be subject to the following regulations: 
1.  All principal and accessory buildings shall be set back at least seventy-five (75) feet from the ordinary high-water mark. 
2.  A setback less than seventy-five (75) feet for a principle building may be allowed if all of the following apply: 
a.  The principal building is constructed or placed on a lot or parcel of land that is immediately adjacent on each side to a lot or parcel of land containing a principal building; and 
b.  The principal building is constructed or placed within a distance equal to the average setback of the principal buildings on the adjacent lots if or thirty-five (35) feet from the ordinary high-water mark, whichever distance is greater. 
3.  Vegetative buffer zone. A vegetative buffer zone shall extend the entire length of the shoreline and thirty-five (35) feet inland. Existing vegetation within the vegetation buffer zone shall be maintained except as follows: 
a.  If the vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or diseased vegetation, the owner of the shoreland property may remove the vegetation, except that if the owner removes all of the vegetation in the vegetative buffer zone, the owner shall establish a vegetative buffer zone with new vegetation. 
b.  Vegetation may be removed in order to establish a viewing or access corridor that is no greater than thirty (30) feet wide for every one hundred (100) feet of shoreline frontage and that extends no more than thirty-five (35) feet inland from the ordinary high-water mark. 
E.  Mandatory Shoreland Protection Requirements. Shoreland buffer zones shall remain in an undisturbed state, except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 per the requirements of Section 17.16.160. 
(Ord. 567, § 3, 7-8-2014; Ord. 228A, § 9, 1-17-2006; prior code § 13-7-5) 
17.28.060 - Drainageways. 
A.  Definition. "Drainageways" are navigable or nonnavigable, aboveground watercourses, detention basins and/or their environs which are identified by the presence of one or more of the following: 
1.  All areas within seventy-five (75) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of a "navigable stream", as classified by the DNR. Such stream may be shown as a "perennial stream", "intermittent stream", or "open channel drainageway", on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map for the City of Sun Prairie and its environs, which includes the applicable buffer zone per Table 17.28.025 D.2.; 
2.  All areas within seventy-five (75) feet centered on a "nonnavigable stream", as classified by the DNR. Such streams may be shown as a "perennial stream", "intermittent stream", or "open channel drainageway", on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map for the City of Sun Prairie and its environs, which includes the buffer zone for an intermittent stream per Table 17.28.025 D.2. 
B.  Purpose of Drainageway Protection Requirements. Drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas. As such, drainageways serve to carry surface waters, supplement floodplain, wetland, and shoreland water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events, filter water-borne pollutants and sediments, promote infiltration and groundwater recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water margin. Drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement. 
C.  Determination of Drainageway Boundaries. General drainageway boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a drainageway depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all drainageway areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A., of this section. 
D.  Mandatory Drainageway Protection Requirements. Drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 per the requirements in Section 17.16.160. Vegetation clearing to maintain drainageway functions is permitted with the written approval of the city engineer. All areas designated as drainageways shall be located within a public easement or dedication for maintenance purposes to preserve proper drainage flow. 
(Ord. 228A, § 10, 1-17-2006; prior code § 13-7-6) 
17.28.070 - Woodlands. 
A.  Definition. "Woodlands" are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of an area of one acre or more, as shown on environmental corridors maps for the city and its environs, prepared by the Dane County regional planning commission. 
B.  Purpose of Woodland Protection Requirements. Woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions. These include atmospheric benefits such as removing air-borne pollutants, carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen production, and evapotranspiration returns. Water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates (particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus) and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities. Woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources. Woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers, greatly reducing runoff-related soil erosion. Woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion. Finally, under proper management techniques, woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources. 
C.  Determination of Woodland Boundaries. General woodland boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a woodland depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A., of this section. 
D.  Mandatory Woodland Protection Requirements. 
1.  Woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040, per the requirements of Section 17.16.160, and areas subject to the following mitigation requirements. Tree removal (30% or less) operations are permitted as a special use in all woodland areas per the requirements of Section 17.16.080 F. Tree removal (more than 30%) is permitted as a conditional use in all woodland areas per the requirements of Section 17.16.080 G. 
2.  Areas of the subject property which are proposed for inclusion within other permanently protected green space areas and which conform to the reforestation mitigation requirements of Section 17.32.080 may be substituted for woodlands subject to tree removal (more than 30%). 
(Ord. 276, § 1, 10-3-2006; prior code § 13-7-7) 
17.28.080 - Steep slopes. 
A.  Definition. "Steep slopes" are areas which contain a gradient of twelve percent (12%) or greater, (equivalent to a ten-foot elevation change in a distance of eighty-three (83) feet or less), as shown on environmental corridors maps for the city and its environs, prepared by the Dane County regional planning commission. 
B.  Purpose of Steep Slope Protection Requirements. Steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption, primarily related to soil erosion. Such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed. Such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil, results in exacerbated erosion downhill, and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways, wetlands, streams, ponds and lakes. Beyond adversely effecting the environmental functions of these resources areas, such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components, thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas. Beyond these threats to the public safety, disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumping, unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties, buildings, and public facilities such as roads and utilities. 
C.  Determination of Steep Slope Boundaries. General steep slope boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a steep slope depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all steep slope areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A., of section. 
D.  Mandatory Steep Slope Protection Requirements. Steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 per the requirements of Section 17.16.160. Steep slopes subject to the reforestation requirements of Section 17.32.080 may be removed from the steep slope natural resource classification and may be developed as woodlands to the extent permitted by the tree removal (30% or less) provisions of Section 17.16.080 F., and the provisions of Section 17.16.160. 
(Ord. 276, § 1, 10-3-2006; prior code § 13-7-8) 
17.28.090 - Ridgetops. 
A.  Definition. "Ridgetops" are areas which are located within one hundred (100) feet of, and at a higher elevation than, areas designated as steep slopes (see Section 17.28.080 A.), as shown on environmental corridors maps for the city and its environs, prepared by the Dane County regional planning commission. 
B.  Purpose of Ridgetop Protection Requirements. Because of their exposed position above steep slopes, ridgetops are susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption, primarily related to wind-related and water-related soil erosion. Such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed. Such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil, results in exacerbated erosion downhill, and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways, wetlands, streams, ponds and lakes. Beyond adversely effecting the environmental functions of these resources areas, such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components and thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas. Beyond these threats to the public safety, disruption of ridgetops also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumping, unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties, buildings, and public facilities such as roads and utilities. 
C.  Determination of Ridgetop Boundaries. General ridgetop boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a ridgetop depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all ridgetop areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A., of this section. 
D.  Mandatory Ridgetop Protection Requirements. Ridgetops shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 per the requirements of Section 17.16.160. Ridgetops subject to the reforestation requirements of Section 17.32.080 may be removed from the ridgetop natural resource classification and may be developed as woodlands to the extent permitted by the tree removal (30% or less) provisions of Section 17.16.080 F., and the provisions of Section 17.16.160. 
(Ord. 276, § 1, 10-3-2006; prior code § 13-7-9) 
17.28.100 - Prairies. 
A.  Definition. "Prairies" are areas of one acre or more which are dominated by the presence of native grasses, including, but not limited to, Big Bluestem, Little Bluestem, Foxtail Barley, Gama Grass, Indian Grass, Switch Grass, and Prairie Cordgrass. Prairies created as part of a prairie restoration process shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. 
B.  Purpose of Prairie Protection Requirements. Prairies provide a unique and rare habitat which is also an important remnant component of the midwestern heritage. 
C.  Determination of Prairie Boundaries. General prairie boundaries are depicted on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a prairie depicted on the official zoning map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 17.28.120. This analysis shall depict the location of all prairie areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection A of this section. 
D.  Mandatory Prairie Protection Requirements. 
1.  Prairies shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.16.040 per the requirements of Section 17.16.160, or unless subject to the following mitigation practices: Section 17.28.100 D.2. 
2.  Disruption to prairie areas shall not be permitted unless an area equal in size is re-established in native prairie elsewhere on the same property, per the approval of the zoning administrator working in conjunction with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(Prior code § 13-7-10) 
17.28.110 - Other permanently protected green space. 
A.  Definition. "Other permanently protected green space" includes all areas designated as permanently protected green space which do not contain protected natural resource areas. These areas are typically required to provide permanent green space per the requirements of Chapter 17.20 of this title. 
B.  Purpose of Protection Requirements for Other Permanently Protected Green Space. These areas are protected in order to meet the minimum green space ratio (GSR) requirements of Section 17.20.040 associated with various cluster residential development options. 
C.  Determination of Other Permanently Protected Green Space Boundaries. Boundaries of these areas shall be as depicted as required to fulfill the minimum green space ratio (GSR) requirements of this title per Chapter 17.20. 
D.  Mandatory Protection Requirements for Other Permanently Protected Green Space. 
1.  Other permanently protected green space areas shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 17.60.040 per the requirements of Section 17.16.160. 
2.  Other permanently protected green space areas shall be planted per the landscaping requirements of Section 17.32.070. 
E.  Dedicated Park Lands. Permanently protected green space areas dedicated and accepted as public open space, shall not be counted as part of the gross site area (GSA) of the subject property. Such areas shall be subtracted as a component of line (1)(b) in the calculations of Section 17.20.030 C. 
(Prior code § 13-7-11) 
17.28.120 - Detailed site analysis. 
A.  Purpose. The detailed site analysis required by this chapter is designed to provide the clear identification of permanently protected green space areas on a site which is proposed for development. The detailed survey work required to identify these areas accurately on a map is not required prior to the initiation of development plans for an area. A detailed site analysis shall be performed in conjunction with required land division documents or development site plans (see Section 17.44.070) for any and all properties containing permanently protected green space areas. (See also Section 17.20.030, required natural resources site evaluation.) 
B.  Description. The detailed site analysis shall be shown on a map of the subject property which depicts the location of all protected natural resource areas, as defined by the provisions of this chapter, and as located by an on-site survey. The detailed site analysis shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  Scale. A minimum scale of one inch equals two hundred (200) feet shall be used. 
2.  Topography. Topographic information is not required for any property which does not contain steep slopes (as designated on Sheet 2 of the official zoning map). For such properties, topographic information with a minimum contour interval of two feet is required. 
3.  Specific Natural Resources Areas. All natural resource areas which require protection under the provisions of this title, including buffer zones, shall be accurately outlined and clearly labeled. Particular care as to clarity shall be taken in areas where different resource types overlap with one another. 
4.  Development Pads. 
a.  All site disruption (including tree removal (30% or less)) proposed to occur within permanently protected natural resource areas shall be limited to development pads. Development pads shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map, site plans required for development permits, and the recorded plat of subdivision or certified survey map. 
b.  Beyond visible damage to natural resources, vegetation, soil, and drainage patterns, site disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree roots, or otherwise damage trees beyond the area in which trees are to be removed from. All trees with calipers exceeding three inches, whose canopies are located adjacent to disturbed areas, which die within a period of five years following site disruption shall be replaced by the property owner with a three inch caliper tree of the same type (canopy or understory). Therefore, care shall be taken to ensure that equipment and actions associated with permitted site disruption activities are limited to the area in which they are permitted. The use of snow fences and other barriers to outline development pads during disruption activity is strongly recommended to limit the extent of inadvertent compaction or other disturbance of earth, and collision damage to vegetation intended for protection. Such barriers should be placed no closer to protected trees than a point on the ground directly under their outer canopy edge. 
5.  Mitigation Areas. All mitigation areas related to the provisions of this title shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map with notations provided which describe the mitigation techniques employed. 
C.  Required Procedure for Submission and Review. 
1.  Required Timing of Submission. The detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for initial review prior to, or concurrently with, the submission of the preliminary plat of subdivision or the certified survey map; or if the proposed development does not involve a land division, then submittal is required as an attachment to a required site plan (see Section 17.44.070). A concept plan of the proposed development may be submitted prior to the submission of the detailed site analysis map, however, in no way does the acceptance and/or general approval of the concept plan indicate the approval of green space protection concepts and/or natural resource feature locations. A detailed site analysis map prepared for the subject property which has been previously approved by city staff, may be submitted for any subsequent development activity on the site. However, modifications to such a previously approved map will be required if the analysis is no longer accurate for the subject property. 
2.  Review by City Staff. City staff shall review the submitted detailed site analysis map for general compliance with the following data sources: 
a.  Sheet 2 of the official zoning map; 
b.  Applicable Dane County regional planning commission environmental corridors maps; 
c.  Air photos of the subject property; 
d.  USGS quads and other sources of topographic information; 
e.  Applicable FEMA and related floodplain maps; 
f.  Applicable federal and state wetland inventory maps; 
g.  The City of Sun Prairie master plan; 
h.  Site visits. 
    The zoning administrator shall provide the petitioner with a written evaluation of the submitted detailed site analysis map which shall indicate the acceptance by city staff, or the need for further analysis work, discussion with the petitioner and/or staff-recognized experts, or a joint site visit. 
3.  Modification of Detailed Site Analysis Map. If necessary, as determined by city staff, revised detailed site analysis maps shall be prepared and submitted for review by city staff, until a version is deemed acceptable. Staff review of the detailed site analysis map may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals as a matter of ordinance interpretation. (See Section 17.48.040.) 
4.  Acceptance of Detailed Site Analysis Map. Upon notification of acceptance by city staff (or in case of appeal, by determination of the board of zoning appeals), the petitioner may proceed with the submittal of necessary development documents. 
D.  Integration of Detailed Site Analysis Information with Required Development and/or Land Division Documents. Information contained on the detailed site analysis map relating to the boundaries of permanently protected green space areas (including natural resource protection areas, other permanently protected green space areas, and required mitigation areas) shall be clearly depicted on any and all site plans required as a precondition for application for any development permit (such as a building permit) and on any proposed plat of subdivision or certified survey map. (See also, Section 17.44.070 regarding required site plans.)

Sections: 

17.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to indicate the minimum requirements for the landscaping of developed lots, street frontages, paved areas, permanently protected green space areas, reforestation areas, and bufferyards. 
(Prior code § 13-8-1) 
17.32.020 - How to use this chapter. 
    This chapter contains the standards which govern the amount, size, type, installation and maintenance of required landscaping. This chapter recognizes the important and diverse benefits which landscaping provides in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and implementing the comprehensive plan. Each section of this chapter is oriented to a specific category of required landscaping. These include landscaping requirements for developed lots (Section 17.32.040), landscaping requirements for street frontages (Section 17.32.050), landscaping requirements for paved areas (Section 17.32.060), landscaping requirements for permanently protected green space areas (Section 17.32.070), landscaping requirements for reforestation (Section 17.32.080), and landscaping requirements for bufferyards (Section 17.32.090). In each instance, a "plant unit" concept is used to provide a maximum amount of flexibility in terms of the selection of plant materials. Section 17.32.030 discusses standard plant unit alternatives used by this chapter. At the end of this chapter, Section 17.32.100 provides a listing of plant species fitting into the "canopy tree", "understory tree", and "shrub" categories used by this title, Section 17.32.110 provides requirements for the installation and maintenance of required landscaping, and Section 17.32.120 describes the procedure for calculating landscaping requirements for this chapter. 
(Prior code § 13-8-2) 
17.32.030 - Plant units. 
    All landscaping requirements are stated in terms of the number of plant units required. All landscaping shall conform to one or more of the plant unit alternatives identified by this section. 
    Illustration 17.32.030, depiction of plant unit alternatives and identification of their minimum requirements, depicts and specifies alternative plant units that may be used for bufferyards, general landscaping, and for paved areas. In general, the five alternative plant mixes are interchangeable, but Alternative D is best suited for street plantings and Alternative E is best suited for the interior of paved areas. In cases where a year-round screen is required, evergreens should be used instead of deciduous trees and shrubs. A detailed listing of which plant species fit each plant type is provided in Section 17.32.100. 

Plant Unit Alternatives 
17.32.040 - Landscaping requirements for developed lots. 
A.  This section requires that certain residential and nonresidential lots developed after the effective date of this chapter (see Section 17.04.100) contain a minimum amount of landscaping. 
B.  Landscaping required by this section is most effective if located close to buildings on the subject property, and shall not be located in those areas required for landscaping as street frontages, paved areas, protected green space areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards, under Sections 17.32.050 through 17.32.090 of this chapter. 
C.  For each acre of gross site area (GSA) of multiplex, apartment, or nonresidential property, the following number of plant units (as described in Section 17.32.030) shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and maintained per the requirements of Section 17.32.110:

17.32.060 - Landscaping requirements for paved areas. 
A.  This section requires that certain paved areas developed after the effective date of this title (see Section 17.04.100) provide a minimum amount of landscaping within the paved area, and/or within ten (10) feet of the paved area. These requirements shall not apply to single-family residential uses. 
B.  A minimum of three hundred sixty (360) square feet of landscaped area, which shall be located within ten (10) feet of the paved area, is required for the placement of each plant unit. Such area does not have to be provided in one contiguous area-sample configurations are depicted on the following page. 
C.  Unless a waiver is granted by the city engineer, all landscaping areas required by this section shall be located within an area which is separated from the paved area by a continuous minimum four-inch tall curb which is constructed of concrete, asphalt or similar material approved by the city engineer. 
D.  For every twenty (20) off-street parking stalls or ten thousand (10,000) square feet of pavement (whichever yields the greater landscaping requirement) located in a development, the following number of plant units (as described in Section 17.32.030) shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and maintained per the requirements of Section 17.32.110:

Paved Area Landscaping 
(Ord. 562, 2001; prior code § 13-8-6) 
17.32.070 - Landscaping requirements for other permanently protected green spaces. 
A.  This section requires that each acre of other permanently protected green space (see Section 17.28.110) approved after the effective date of this title be planted with a minimum amount of landscaping. 
B.  For every one acre of other permanently protected green space in a development, two plant units (as described in Section 17.32.030) shall be provided. In addition, adequate ground cover shall be provided to stabilize the soil. (Prior code 13-8-7) 
17.32.080 - Landscaping requirements for required reforestation. 
A.  This section requires that each acre of required reforestation area approved after the effective date of this title (see Section 17.04.100) be planted with a minimum amount of landscaping. 
B.  For every one acre of reforestation area required under the provisions of this title, ten (10) plant units of Alternative A, B, or D (as described in Section 17.32.030) shall be provided. In addition, adequate ground cover shall be provided to stabilize the soil. 
    Rationale: The provisions of this section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide. (See Section 17.28.070.) (Prior code § 13-8-8) 
17.32.090 - Landscaping requirements for bufferyards. 
A.  Purpose. This section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this title. (See Section 17.04.100.) A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and fencing, that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances. These nuisances can occur between adjacent zoning districts and between different development options within the same zoning district. Such nuisances are dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings or parking areas. 
    Rationale: One of zoning's most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses. The location of districts is supposed to provide protection, but in the city, this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as single-family residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this title. Bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses. 
B.  Required Locations for Bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts, or two different development options within the same zoning district, abut one another. Bufferyards may be located in required setback areas. Bufferyards shall also be required adjacent to rights-of-way wherever a zoning district or development option boundary is located within such right-of-way. In such instances, the one-half of the bufferyard requirements of this section shall be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in Section 17.32.050, if such requirements of this section are greater. (In such instances, the width of the right-of-way may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard, however, the minimum width required along the street frontage by Section 17.32.050, shall be provided in all cases.) Bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing, dedicated, or officially mapped right-of-way. 
C.  Determination of Required Bufferyard. The determination of bufferyard requirements is a two-staged process. First, the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using Table 17.32.090(D)(1). Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property. The required level of opacity indicated by this table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts and/or development options. The provisions of this subsection indicate the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district and development option boundaries. 
1.  Identification of Required Level of Opacity. Table 17.32.090(D)(1) shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard. The required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table (representing the subject property's zoning district and development option) intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table (representing the adjacent property's zoning district and development option). The value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property. 
2.  Identification of Detailed Bufferyard Requirements. Table 17.32.090(D)(2) shall be used to select the minimum levels of bufferyard width, landscaping, berming and fencing needed to achieve the minimum level of opacity (from Table 17.32.090(D)(1) for the required bufferyard. The landscaping component of each option is given in plant units (as described in Section 17.32.030). For any given bufferyard, any combination of options for the same level of opacity may be used. This approach provides a very broad range of choice for bufferyard width, landscaping, berming and fencing, which can be varied according to site features. 
a.  If a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning or development option boundary, that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity indicated in Table 17.32.090(D)(1). 
b.  For each level of opacity listed in Table 17.32.090(D)(1), a wide variety of width, plant unit, berm, and structure combinations are possible. These are listed in Table 17.32.090(D)(2). The requirements listed in Table 17.32.090(D)(2) pertain to the number of plant units, the minimum bufferyard width, and the type of berm or fencing required within every one hundred (100) feet of required bufferyard. A variety of plant unit options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard. Section 17.32.030 describes the various available plant unit alternatives. Section 17.32.100 provides a listing of tree and shrub species which correspond to the plant unit descriptions. 
D.  Tables for Required Bufferyards. See Tables 17.32.090(D)(1) and (2). 
Notes for Table 17.32.090(D)(1): 
* ;hg;For properties zoned in the rural holding district (RH-35ac), refer to the comprehensive plan's preferred future land use map (Map 11-3) to determine the proposed zoning district for such property. Bufferyard requirements shall be taken from this proposal. 
**Refer to Section 17.24.095 for exceptions to landscaping requirements for bufferyards for nonresidential uses in the Urban Residential (UR-12) zoning district. 
    Caution: The required opacity levels listed in Table 17.32.090(D)(1) are generally different on either side of any given zoning district or development option boundary. Care should be taken to properly use this table (per subsection 17.32.090(C)(1)) to determine the subject property's requirement.

17.32.110 - Requirements for the installation, maintenance and use of landscaped and bufferyard areas. 
A.  Installation. 
1.  Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this title shall be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan (see Section 17.44.070) within seven hundred thirty (730) days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property. 
2.  Surety. 
a.  The property owner shall file, subject to approval by the city administrator, a bond, a certificate of deposit, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a certified check, in amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimate of landscaping materials and installation cost prepared by the zoning administrator as surety to guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the property owner or his or her contractors within such seven hundred thirty (730) day period. An enforceable contract, for all work on the subject property required under the provisions of this chapter, from a qualified contractor (valid for such seven hundred thirty (730) day period), may be used in lieu of such cost estimate to determine the amount of surety. 
b.  If a part of a plat of subdivision approved per the requirements of this title, such amount may be split into amounts which are applicable to phases of the plat approved per the requirements of Section 16.32.020 of the city of Sun Prairie land division ordinance. 
c.  Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions apply, may, in lieu of such contract or instrument of guarantee, file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in its behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Existing plant material which meets the requirements of Section 17.32.020 and which will be preserved on the subject property following the completion of development, may be counted as contributing to the landscaping requirements. 
4.  All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless such vegetation is already fully established. 
5.  The exact placement of required plants and structures shall be the decision of each property owner within the requirements of this chapter, except that the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters in order to maximize their chance for survival. 
b.  Where a combination of plant materials, and/or berming and/or fencing is used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward the interior of the subject property and the plant material shall be located toward the exterior of the subject property. 
c.  A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the register of deeds office, that an adjacent property owners shall agree to provide a partial or full portion of the required bufferyard on an immediately adjacent portion of their land, thereby exempting the developer from providing all or a portion of the required bufferyard on his or her property. 
d.  In no manner shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected and/or located in a manner which results in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard. (See Section 17.36.030.) 
B.  Maintenance. The continued and continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall be a requirement of this title and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which such materials are required. This requirement shall run with the property and is binding upon all future property owners. Development of any and all property following the effective date of this title shall constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this section. Upon failure to comply with these provisions, the city may enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating and maintaining all required landscaping and bufferyard materials, and may specially assess the costs thereof against the property. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered a violation of this title, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement procedures and penalties. (See Section 17.48.060.) 
C.  Use of Required Bufferyard and Landscaped Areas. Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Such areas may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails provided that: no required material is eliminated; the total width of the required bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is maintained; and all other regulations of this title are met. In no event, however, shall swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, or other such active recreation used be permitted in such areas. Furthermore, in no instance shall any parking be permitted in such areas, nor shall any outdoor display of storage of materials be permitted in such areas.

G.  Calculation of Minimum Required Parking Spaces. 
1.  General Guidelines for Calculating Required Parking Spaces. The requirements of subsection (G)(3) of this section shall be used to determine the minimum required number of off-site parking spaces which must be provided on the subject property. Requirements are generally tied to the capacity of the use; the gross floor area of the use; or the number of employees which work at the subject property during the largest work shift. The term "capacity" as used herein means the maximum number of persons that may be accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by state Building Code regulations, whichever number is greater. References herein to "employee(s) on the largest work shift" means the maximum number of employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time period during which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift may occur on any particular day of the week or during a lunch or dinner period in the case of a restaurant. In all cases, one reserved parking space shall be provided for each vehicle used by the operation during business hours. Such spaces shall be in addition to those required by subsection (G)(3) of this section. Where such parking needs of any land use exceed the minimum requirements of this title, additional parking spaces sufficient to meet the average maximum weekly peak-hour parking space demand shall be provided by such land use. 
2.  Joint Parking Facilities. 
a.  Parking facilities which have been approved by the city engineer to provide required parking for one or more uses, shall provide a total number of parking spaces which shall not be less than the sum total of the separate parking needs for each use during any peak hour parking period when such joint parking facility is utilized at the same time by such uses. 
b.  Each parking space designed to serve as joint parking shall not be located farther than five hundred (500) feet from the access to all of the various areas it is designated to serve. 
c.  The applicant(s) for approval of a joint parking facility shall demonstrate to the city engineer's satisfaction that there is no substantial conflict in the demand for parking during the principal operating hours of the two of more uses for which the joint parking facility is proposed to serve. 
d.  A legally binding instrument, approved by the city administrator, shall be executed by any and all parties to be served by such joint parking facility. This instrument shall be recorded with the register of deeds office, and filed with the city clerk. A fee shall be required to file this instrument (see Section 17.48.050(A)(12)). 
3.  Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements for Land Uses. Each land use shall provide sufficient off-street parking spaces to accommodate average weekly peak hour parking demand. The following requirements shall be the minimum for each land use:

The city council may reduce the total number of parking spaces required for senior housing by up to fifty percent (50%) based upon a finding that the proposed development is located within close proximity to services such as grocery, pharmacy, etc., or is adequately served by public transportation. The number of spaces which are required to be covered may be reduced by up to fifty percent (50%) based upon evidence submitted by the developer that the reduction is directly related to parking demand. In no instance shall the number of covered parking spaces be fewer than one per two dwelling units.

4.  Orientation. Any and all fences, landscape walls, or decorative posts shall be erected so as to locate visible supports and other structural components toward the subject property. 
5.  Maintenance. Any and all fences, landscape walls, or decorative posts shall be maintained in a structurally sound and attractive manner. (Ord. 2003-79 §§ 1-3, 2003; Prior code § 13-9-20) 
17.36.210 - Administration and enforcement of performance standards. 
A.  Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of performance standards set forth herein range from those which can be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal senses and no mechanical equipment, to those requiring great technical competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the intent of this title that: 
1.  Where determinations can be made by the zoning administrator using equipment normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before notice of violations is issued. 
2.  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the city to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be available for causing corrections or apparent violations of performance standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement. 
a.  The zoning administrator shall give written notice, by certified mail or other means, ensuring a signed receipt for such notice to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violations. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the zoning administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator. 
b.  The notice shall state, and it is declared, that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the administrative official within the time limit set constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this title. The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom it is directed, technical determination as described in this title will be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged against those responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will be paid by the city. 
B.  Enforcement of the provisions of this chapter shall be per Section 17.48.060.

(Ord. 511, 2000; prior code § 13-9-22) 
17.36.230 - Design standards for developments in the suburban industrial (SI) zoning district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards to guide the appearance of development (i.e., new construction, building additions and site alterations) occurring within the suburban industrial (SI) zoning district, so that areas zoned for suburban industrial use, including the Sun Prairie Business Park, have a consistently high quality and character. 
B.  Applicability. The following design standards shall be met for any of the following activities that occur on properties located within the suburban industrial (SI) zoning district: 
1.  New development, 
2.  Redevelopment, 
3.  Expansions or alterations of buildings greater than 2,500 SF, or 
4.  Expansion or reconfiguration of loading or parking areas 
Review for compliance will occur at the time of application for special use permit, conditional use permit, zoning permit, or any other review that is required under this title for the development activities being proposed. Compliance with these design standards is required in addition to the general performance standards of Chapter 17.36 of the zoning ordinance. In the event of conflicting provisions, the more restrictive shall control. 
C.  Request for Relief. Applicants who cannot meet one or more of these standards due to space constraints or other conditions, or proposed to meet the intent of a standard by other means, may seek relief through the approval of a conditional use permit. A conditional use permit may be approved provided that the city determines that the following standards are met: 
1.  The requested use is compatible with existing or planned surrounding land uses; 
2.  Exceptions or reductions from landscape bufferyard and screening standards are kept to a minimum; 
3.  The public benefit resulting from flexibility in design standards are justified; and 
4.  The standards for all conditional use permits contained in Section 17.44.050 are met. 
D.  Site Design Standards. It is the intent of this section to ensure safe vehicle and pedestrian circulation patterns, encourage an aesthetically pleasing, high quality setting, and to mitigate visual and environmental impacts associated with on-site activities, such as parking and storage.

3.  Rooftop Equipment & Venting Systems. 
a.  Rooftop mechanical equipment, including powered vents, but not including solar panels or fixtures, shall be substantially hidden from view from any adjacent public street, highway corridor, and/or residentially zoned property using one the following techniques: 
i.  On pitched roofs equipment shall be located on the least visible side of the roof. 
ii.  On flat roofs there shall be a parapet wall to hide equipment. Installation of equipment that extends higher than the parapet will be allowed if that equipment is set back from the wall a sufficient distance so as not to be visible from any adjacent public street. 
iii.  Where equipment cannot be hidden through siting and building design, the equipment shall be screened with a solid fence or panel that matches the color of the nearest wall (when on a flat roof) or the color of the roof (when on a pitched roof). Such screening should generally be several times wider than the equipment, but no taller than the equipment, to avoid the effect of creating simply a larger vertical protrusion. The screening system shall be considered as part of overall building design and review. 
b.  If still partially visible from adjacent public street, rooftop mechanical equipment and venting systems (including passive vents) shall match the color of the roof or corresponding façade (whichever is visible with the equipment).

3.  Signs for Approved Temporary Uses (Including Seasonal). Temporary uses are land uses that are in place for a short period of time. Typically such uses include seasonal activities such as outdoor display and sales of Christmas trees, fireworks, etc. Signage for an approved temporary use shall meet the same standards as "temporary signs for businesses regular event," item 1 of this subsection, except that the sign associated with a temporary use may remain in place for the same period of time that the temporary use is permitted to remain, typically one hundred eighty (180) days. 
4.  Temporary, Removable A-Frame or Sandwich Board Signs. An A-frame sign is a temporary, non-illuminated sign supported by its own frame in a manner that forms an "A" when in use. This sign type may be placed in the public right-of-way in front of a business on a daily basis and are permitted as follows: 
a.  Number. One temporary, removable A-frame or sandwich board sign is allowed per business. Businesses with more than one frontage on a public street are allowed one such sign per frontage up to a maximum of two signs.

e.  Location. Signs are restricted to the lot of the business establishment to which a permit has been issued or to the abutting sidewalk frontage of the same. A-frame or sandwich board signs are permitted within the public right-of-way only where the sidewalk is wide enough to adequately accommodate both the usual pedestrian traffic in the area and the sign. Signs must be placed so as to leave not less than four and one-half consecutive feet of sidewalk width at every point, which is clear and unimpeded for pedestrian traffic. All sandwich board signs must also comply with vision standards contained in Section 17.36.030. In times of excessive snow accumulation, the permit holder must use discretion in placing the sandwich board sign on the sidewalk, considering visibility, access, and safety. 
f.  Placement. The holder of the sandwich board sign is responsible for securing the sandwich board sign and daily removal of the sandwich board sign. Signs may not be attached, chained or in any manner affixed to public property including street trees. In no event shall the placement of a sandwich board sign on the public sidewalk obstruct access to any crosswalk, mailbox, curb cut, public parking space or any other public property. In no event shall an A-frame or sandwich board sign be placed on any bicycle path. The sign shall not obstruct access to any fire hydrant, fire escape or fire door, or obstruct the clear view of any traffic signal, regulatory sign or street sign. Whether the placement of said sign obstructs access to any of the foregoing shall be the determination of the building inspector. 
g.  Enforcement. It shall be assumed that A-frame or sandwich board signs located within the public right-of-way are a privilege and not a right. The city shall have the right to require their removal at any time because of anticipated or unanticipated problems or conflicts. To the extent possible, the permittee shall be given prior notice of any time period during which the placement of A-frame or sandwich board signs is prohibited. Furthermore, the sign permit may be revoked by the building inspector following notice of the permittee. The permit may be revoked if one or more conditions outlined in this Section have been violated, or if the sign is determined to constitute a public nuisance not specifically outlined in this Section. Following the revocation of the sign permit, no application for the same site shall be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of revocation. The permittee has a right to appeal the decision of the building inspector within thirty (30) days of issuance of a revocation notice. Appeals must follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 17.48, Administration and Enforcement. 
h.  Indemnification. Where a temporary, removable A-frame or sandwich board sign is permitted in the public right-of-way, the owner/lessee/lessor of the business to which a permit has been issued and the property owner shall agree in writing to hold the city harmless for any personal injury or property damage resulting from the existence or operation of said sign, and shall furnish evidence of general liability insurance in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) with the city as additional named insured or otherwise as determined by the city administrator or their designee.

TABLE 17.40.070(B): PERMANENT SIGNS
NONRESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT Maximum Number of Signs Maximum Area Maximum Height Wall Signs 2 per nonresidential lot frontage per individual tenant or building facade (only 1 if projecting sign is used), 1 additional if building is over 100 ft. in length; 1 additional on non-street side to ID entrance.  7% of the building facade, up to a max. of 450 sq. ft. per facade (12% for emergency medical facilities); 
 10% of the building facade portion assigned to a tenant of a multi-tenant building, up to a max. of 450 sq. ft. total per facade; 
 10 sq. ft. non-street side entrance sign (20 sq. ft. for emergency medical facilities). Height of principal building. Projecting Signs 1 per individual tenant or building facade - DC and MSO districts only. 7% of the building facade, or portion thereof assigned to a tenant up to a max. of 16 sq. ft. Must be at least 10 ft. above the ground, no taller than the height of principal building, or no higher than the bottom of 2nd floor window when residences are located on the second floor. Freestanding Signs  1 per street frontage; 
 max 2 per lot; 
 1 additional with lot frontage over 1,000 linear feet. 1.5 sq. ft. per 1 linear foot of lot frontage up to a max. 150 sq. ft.*  Pylon or pole - 8 ft.; 
 Ground sign - 14 ft. (16 ft. for emergency medical facilities)*; 
 Group sign - height of principal building*; 
 Interchange sign - 35 ft.*  
* See Section 17.40.070.C for additional provisions related to height and area requirements 
1.  Maximum Number of Signs. The maximum permitted number of permanent signs per lot is computed with a total allowable number of freestanding signs and a total allowable number of wall and projecting signs calculated independently. The maximum number of signs per lot is defined as the sum of these two calculations. 
a.  Freestanding Signs. A maximum of one freestanding sign is allowed per continuous street frontage up to a maximum of two per lot. A maximum of one sign per lot shall be allowed to exceed the maximum eight feet in height and then only when permitted as a group sign, ground sign, or interchange sign. One additional freestanding sign per street frontage may be allowed for any street frontage over one thousand (1,000) linear feet. 
b.  Wall and Projecting Signs. Maximum of two wall signs, one of which may be a projecting sign if located in the central commercial zoning district or Main Street overlay zoning district, are allowed per each facade facing a nonresidential lot frontage. For buildings greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, one additional wall sign may be allowed on each facade facing a nonresidential lot frontage. One additional wall or projecting sign, up to a maximum of ten (10) square feet, or up to twenty (20) square feet for emergency medical facilities and emergency medical campuses, containing only the name of the business may be erected to identify a building entrance on a facade facing a residential lot frontage. Wall signs shall not extend beyond the edge of any wall or other surface to which they are mounted, nor shall a flush-mounted wall sign project more than eighteen (18) inches from the wall's surface. 
2.  Maximum Sign Area of Individual Signs. The maximum permitted sign area of an individual sign is computed based on the type of sign as follows: 
a.  Freestanding Signs. The maximum permitted area of individual freestanding signs shall be equal to one and one-half square feet of sign area for every one linear foot of nonresidential lot frontage up to a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) square feet per sign. Sign area not used along one street frontage shall not be assigned to another lot frontage. See sign area calculations, Section 17.40.040(B). 
b.  Wall and Projecting Signs. The maximum permitted area of an individual wall or projecting sign for an individual tenant or building facade shall be equal to seven percent (7%) of the building facade, or up to ten percent (10%) of the portion thereof assigned to a tenant of a multi-tenant building in a nonresidential district, up to a maximum of four hundred fifty (450) square feet per facade for wall signs and sixteen (16) square feet for projecting signs. This may be increased to a maximum of twelve percent (12%) or up to four hundred fifty (450) square feet for emergency medical facilities and emergency medical campuses. These maximums also apply to the two allowable signs per facade or tenant, therefore only one such sign will be allowed if the maximum allowable sign area is used in a single sign. Multi-tenant buildings shall be computed on an individual tenant basis with the sign area percentage calculated based on the tenant's facade. Sign area not used by one tenant shall not be assigned to another tenant or building unless outlined in an approved sign design plan per Section 17.40.040(E). The area of projecting signs is further regulated under Section 17.40.070(C)(4). See also sign area calculation, Section 17.40.040(C). 

Wall sign area = A x B 
3.  Maximum Sign Height. No wall or projecting sign shall be higher than the building on which it is mounted. When residential uses are located on the second story, projecting signs shall not extend beyond the height of the bottom of any second story window. (See also definition of "roof sign" and "integral roof sign.") Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, freestanding signs shall be a maximum height of eight feet above ground level. If the centerline of the nearest local, county, or state roadway is higher than ground level, the height of the sign shall be measured from the centerline of the roadway. A freestanding sign may exceed the eight-foot height maximum only if it meets the definition of an interchange sign, group sign, or ground sign, and meets the specific standards for such sign as stated in Section 17.40.070.C. 
C.  Other Sign Regulations. Interchange signs, group signs, projecting signs, changeable copy signs, electronic message signs, auxiliary signs, community information signs, and flags (more than three on a lot) are signs which by their design or purpose require special regulations in addition to those for typical wall or freestanding signs. These special signs are considered permanent signs on nonresidential property except that auxiliary signs and community information signs may be allowed in any zoning district. 
1.  Interchange Sign Overlay District. Interchange signs may be erected only within the Interchange Sign overlay district, as established on the official zoning map. One interchange sign is allowed on any lot within the Interchange Sign overlay district, and only in association with a legally conforming commercial, office or industrial use. Interchange signs shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet, unless a greater height up to a maximum of fifty (50) is approved through the conditional use process per Section 17.44.050. Such increases shall be granted only upon a finding by the city that the petitioner has justified the need for the increase in the height due to unique conditions of the property. Interchange signs shall comply with all other requirements of freestanding business signs in this chapter. The Sun Prairie business park, due to existing covenants, is not included within the interchange sign overlay district. 
2.  Group Signs. 
a.  Group signs are freestanding signs used to identify the name of a multi-tenant building, a lot containing two or more uses, a group development, or commercial planned development. Such signs may contain the group name of the development and/or the individual names of the tenants in the development. Such signs are regulated under the common sign design plan of Section 17.40.040.E. Group signs shall comply with all of the requirements of freestanding business signs except that group signs may be erected up to a maximum height equal to the height of the principal building on the lot as measured from ground level. Group signs shall be permitted in lieu of freestanding business signs, not in addition to such signs. 
b.  Recognizing that some amount of flexibility is sometimes needed to address unusual or unique circumstances, group signs may exceed the maximum height and sign area standards through the approval of a conditional use permit provided the city determines that the following standards are met: 
i.  Maximum sign height may be increased by up to fifteen percent (15%). 
ii.  On lots that exceed one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage on a single street, the maximum sign area of a group sign may be increased up to a maximum of two hundred (200) square feet. 
iii.  The base of the sign must be constructed of high quality materials, such as brick or stone. The height of the base shall be in a proportion appropriate to the sign and principal building. 
iv.  Streetscaping features, such as garden walls, benches, planters or other decorative features, shall be added within the front yard as a means of defining the street edge and creating an aesthetically pleasing view from the street. 
v.  The proposed sign shall be compatible in scale and architectural character with the building or property on which the sign will be located. 
vi.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.050, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses. 

Group Sign 
3.  Ground Signs. Ground signs are freestanding signs with decorative masonry, plastic, or wood bases. 
a.  Ground signs may be erected up to a maximum height of fourteen (14) feet above ground level or above the centerline elevation of the nearest local, county or state roadway if the roadway is higher than ground level. 
b.  For emergency medical facilities and emergency medical campuses, ground signs may be erected up to a maximum of sixteen (16) feet above ground level or above the centerline elevation of the nearest local, county or state roadway if the roadway is higher than ground level. 
c.  Recognizing that some amount of flexibility is sometimes needed to address unusual or unique circumstances, ground signs may exceed the maximum height and sign area standards through the approval of a conditional use permit provided the city determines that the following standards are met: 
i.  Maximum sign height may be increased to twenty (20) feet. 
ii.  On lots that exceed one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage on a single street, the maximum sign area of a ground sign may be increased up to a maximum of two hundred (200) square feet. 
iii.  The base of the sign must be constructed with high quality materials, such as brick or stone. The height of the base shall be in a proportion appropriate to the sign and principal building. 
iv.  Streetscaping features, such as garden walls, benches, planters or other decorative features, shall be added within the front yard as a means of defining the street edge and creating an aesthetically pleasing view from the street. 
v.  The proposed sign shall be compatible in scale and architectural character with the building or property on which the sign will be located. 
vi.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.050, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses. 
4.  Projecting Signs. Projecting signs are permitted only within the Central Commercial (CC) zoning district and the Main Street overlay (MSO) district. Projecting signs shall be erected according to the regulations applicable to wall signs unless herein amended. Individual projecting signs shall not exceed sixteen (16) square feet in area. The entire bottom edge of such sign shall be located a minimum of ten (10) feet above the ground level directly under the sign. Such sign shall be mounted in a fixed or stationary position, with no swinging parts. In no instance shall a projecting sign be located directly over a public or private street, drive, or parking area. 

Projecting sign minimum height and maximum area. 
5.  Changeable Copy Signs. Changeable copy signs may only be allowed as permanent wall, projecting or freestanding signs designed as either an individual sign or part of another permanent sign. Changeable copy signs when part of another sign shall be designed as an integral part of the sign and not added to the same pole or structure without being designed as part of the original sign. Such signs shall adhere to all other requirements of this chapter. 
6.  Electronic Message Signs. Electronic message signs may only be allowed as permanent signs designed as either an individual sign or part of another permanent sign. Each message shall be displayed for a time frame of not less than five seconds. A maximum of one message shall be displayed during each time frame. No continuous or rolling displays shall be permitted. A special use permit will be required for such signs. Such signs shall adhere to Section 17.44.040, procedures applicable to all special uses, and all other requirements of this chapter. 
7.  Auxiliary Signs. Auxiliary signs, such as menu boards, shall only be permitted subject to the review and written approval by the zoning code enforcement officer as to whether the sign meets the definition of an auxiliary sign. Such signs shall be calculated independently of the requirements of Section 17.40.070.B, and shall not exceed fifty (50) square feet per lot or use. Such signs shall conform to all height, design, location and other applicable regulations. In the case of menu board signs, the sign area shall not exceed 50 square feet per drive through lane. 
8.  Community Information Signs. 
a.  Such sign shall be permitted as a conditional use within all zoning districts and upon any property within the jurisdiction of this title (see Section 17.04.080). As such, the review of a request for the erection of a community information sign shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.44.050. The proposed size, configuration, and design of the sign shall be described as part of the conditional use requirements. As a conditional use, the city may revoke the designation of an approved community information sign if such sign fails to comply with the requirements of this title. Such action shall proceed per the requirements of Section 17.44.050.H. Upon revocation, the owner of such sign shall have thirty (30) days to remove the sign at the owner's expense. 
b.  Such sign shall only display information regarding events and information of general interest to the residents of Sun Prairie. Copy which may be considered as advertising a product, private or restricted participation event, or activity for private profit shall be prohibited. 
c.  Such sign may be located on private or public property. 
d.  Such sign shall conform to the visibility standards of Section 17.36.030. 
e.  Such sign shall not be counted as adding to the area of signage on the subject property. 
9.  Statuary signs. Statuary signs may be allowed in nonresidential zoning districts through the approval of a conditional use permit provided the city determines that the following standards are met: 
a.  A maximum of one statuary sign per lot will be allowed. 
b.  All such signs shall be set on a decorative base at a minimum of two feet above the average grade and may not exceed fourteen (14) feet in total height. 
c.  The maximum permitted area of statuary signs shall be equal to one and one-half square feet of sign area for every one linear foot of nonresidential lot frontage up to a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) square feet per sign face. The sign face for all statuary signs shall be the area of the smallest rectangle which can encompass all words, letters, figures, emblems, and other elements of the sign message. 
d.  Statuary signs or parts of signs shall not move or rotate. 
e.  Shall comply with Section 17.44.050, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses. 
(Ord. 600, §§ 2, 3, 5-19-2015; Ord. 512, § 1, 11-20-2012) 
17.40.080 - Prohibited signs. 
    The following signs shall be prohibited except as noted herein or elsewhere in this chapter. 
A.  Flashing Signs. No flashing signs shall be allowed except as exempt holiday decorations and displays. 
B.  Moving Signs. Except for electronic message signs, no fluttering, undulating, swinging, rotating, or otherwise moving signs, lights or decorations, shall be permitted except as special event signs. 
C.  Off-Premises Signs. No off-premises advertising signs shall be permitted except: as provided within the right-of-way of U.S. Highway 151 per applicable State of Wisconsin Statutes, as permitted on the public sidewalk abutting a business to which an A-frame or sandwich board sign permit has been issued in conformance with the standards outlined in Section 17.40.060.A.4, or per the standards outlined in Section 17.40.080.C.1. Off-premises directional signs erected by a government agency or nonresidential institutional land use, or as a nonbusiness temporary sign four square feet in area or less, meeting the definition of a directional sign are permitted off-site. 
Rationale: The restriction regarding off-premises signs above, reflects a formal finding of fact on the part of the city of Sun Prairie Plan Commission and City Council that the prohibition of off-premises advertising signage furthers two compelling government interests: (1) the general public interest of reducing visual clutter caused by off-premises advertising signage which the city has determined is a significant cause of unsafe traffic conditions; and (2) the public interest served by furthering the implementation of the purposes of this title and the city of Sun Prairie Comprehensive Plan in terms of limiting the further spread of strip commercial development, of which off-premises advertising signs are a primary contributor. Furthermore, the city advocates that this regulation leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayable on such off-premises advertising signs, namely distributed print media, broadcast media, and point-of-purchase display, and is narrowly defined so as to limit such prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage. 
1.  Billboard Replacement Program. An owner of a legally nonconforming billboard sign existing upon the effective date of this chapter may apply for a conditional use permit to replace an existing billboard sign with a digital billboard sign within the following parameters: 
a.  The sign shall comply with the standards contained in Section 84.30(4), Wisconsin Statutes. 
b.  The area of the digital billboard sign may be equal to or less than the billboard(s) being replaced. Multiple billboards may be removed and the sign area of the eliminated billboards may be added together when calculating the maximum sign area allowable for the digital billboard. In addition, the replacement ratio may be increased to allow the digital billboard to be up to one and one-half times the sign area of the billboard sign(s) to be removed, provided the following standards are met and the city determines that the increase is acceptable in the proposed location. In any instance, the total area of the digital billboard sign shall not exceed the maximum allowable area established in Section 84.30(4), Wisconsin Statutes. 
i.  The proposed digital billboard sign incorporates a monopole support with a decorative base; 
ii.  Landscaping or other decorative treatment, such as a decorative wall or masonry feature, is provided at the base of the digital billboard in such a manner as to provide an aesthetically pleasing view from any adjacent public streets or highways; 
iii.  The digital billboard is made available for periodic messages of public interest as a benefit to the community. The conditions and frequency of such messages shall be determined as part of the conditional use review and approval. 
c.  No portion of the digital billboard shall be located closer to the public road right-of-way than the sign it is replacing, nor shall it be located within fifteen (15) feet of any public road right-of-way as calculated by the shortest measurable distance between the nearest point of the sign to the edge of the right-of-way. 
d.  The illumination of an off-premises digital billboard sign shall not exceed a brightness level of 0.3 footcandles above ambient light, as measured using a footcandle meter at the following pre-set distances from the base of the sign structure: 
300-375 square feet sign face ..... 150 feet 
376-475 square feet sign face ..... 200 feet 
476-672 square feet sign face ..... 250 feet 
The measurement of the brightness level shall be taken with the meter aimed directly at the billboard sign face from the applicable pre-set distance.

17.40.090 - Abandonment of business signs. 
A.  Abandoned Signs Defined. When the zoning code enforcement officer determines that a business sign is no longer being used in connection with an ongoing business on the lot, the property owner shall be notified in writing that the business sign shall be deemed to be abandoned if, after ninety (90) days for nonconforming signs, or after one hundred eighty (180) days for conforming signs from the date of receipt of the notice, the sign continues to be abandoned. 
B.  Removal of Abandoned Signs. All abandoned signs and all associated structural sign supports shall be removed and the grass or pavement restored by the owner of the property within thirty (30) days from the date the sign is deemed by the zoning code enforcement officer to be abandoned. 
C.  Extension of Deadline for Removal. If the property owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the zoning code enforcement officer through documentary evidence that an imminent sale or lease of the property is pending, the zoning code enforcement officer may stay the finding of abandonment and may extend the time for removing the sign and related structures for a period up to ninety (90) days. 
(Ord. 512, § 1, 11-20-2012) 
17.40.100 - Nonconforming signs.

All signs allowed as temporary signs found not to be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter regardless of when erected shall be removed within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice of noncompliance and removal from the zoning code enforcement officer. 
B.  Nonconforming Permanent Signs. 
1.  Intent. This section is intended to encourage the eventual elimination of signs which do not comply with this title. The elimination of nonconforming signs is important to the purpose stated in Section 17.40.010. However, it is also the intent of the Ordinance to avoid unreasonable invasion of property rights while accomplishing removal of nonconforming signs. 
2.  Compliance. A legally nonconforming sign not complying with this title, but in place on the effective date of this title, shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of this title if one of the following occurs or conditions exist: 
a.  The sign is replaced or relocated. 
b.  The sign's frame or structural support are replaced or altered in any manner excluding normal maintenance, sign face change, or aesthetic enhancement which does not extend, enlarge or intensify the nonconformity. The "enhancement" of a sign such as the addition of pole covers, or a monument base are permitted as they do not alter the sign's area, height, etc. 
c.  No sign which is nonconforming in one respect may be altered even if such change is permitted herein (e.g., if a sign exceeds the maximum height permitted), said sign shall not be enlarged even if such increase in sign area is permitted within this title. 
d.  The sign becomes abandoned per Section 17.40.090. 
3.  Continuance. A nonconforming sign may be continued if it is maintained in good condition however, it shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign. It may not be structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the sign, except as otherwise provided in the title. If damaged or destroyed, it may be replaced within one year after the calamity to the size, location, and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, if the damage or destruction was caused by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation. The replacement of a sign face of a nonconforming sign shall not be considered the replacement of a sign.

In order to prevent this from occurring, all conditional uses are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to conditional uses, in addition to the general requirements of this title and the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is located. A public hearing process is required to review a request for a conditional use. 
3.  Conditional uses are also those proposed uses which are listed as special uses, but fail to meet one of the requirements for special use approval listed in Section 17.16.060. (See Section 17.16.020(C)(2).)

b.  How is the proposed conditional use (in its specific location) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan, this title, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city? 
c.  Does the proposed conditional use, in its proposed location and as depicted on the required site plan (see subsection (C)(4) of this section), result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other matters effecting the public health, safety, or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of the provisions and policies of this title, the comprehensive plan, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development? 
d.  Does the proposed conditional use maintain the desired consistency of land uses, land use intensities, and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property? 
e.  Is the proposed conditional use located in an area that will be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services provided by public agencies serving the subject property? 
f.  Do the potential public benefits of the proposed conditional use outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed conditional use (as identified in subsections (D)(2)(a) through (e) of this section), after taking into consideration any proposal by the petitioner and any requirements recommended by the petitioner to ameliorate such impacts? 
3.  Third, a staff report shall be forwarded to the plan commission for review and use in the development of a recommendation to city council. 
E.  Review by Plan Commission. City council shall not approve a conditional use without allowing for a recommendation from the plan commission per the provisions of this subsection.

If such a public hearing is necessary, city council shall provide notice per the requirements of subsection (E)(1) of this section. 
F.  Review and Action by City Council. City council shall consider the recommendation of the plan commission regarding the proposed conditional use. The council may request further information and/or additional reports from the plan commission, city staff and/or the petitioner. The council may take final action on the conditional use at time of its initial meeting, or such proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further consideration city council may approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may approve the proposed conditional use with modifications (per the recommendations of city staff, the plan commission, or city council itself), or may deny the proposed conditional use. If the city council wishes to make significant changes in the proposed conditional use, as recommended by the plan commission, then the procedure set forth in Section 62.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin Statutes shall be followed prior to council action. Any action to amend the provisions of this title requires a majority vote of the council. Approval of the proposed conditional use shall be considered as the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed conditional use. 
G.  Effect of Denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the zoning administrator. 
H.  Revocation of an Approved Conditional Use. Upon approval by city council, the petitioner must demonstrate that the proposed conditional use meets all general and specific conditional use requirements in the site plan required for initiation of development activity on the subject property per Section 17.44.070. Once a conditional use is granted, no site plan approval (per Section 17.44.070), certificate of occupancy (per Section 17.44.080), or building permit shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of this title. Any conditional use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this title shall be considered in violation of this title and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties. A conditional use may be revoked for such a violation by majority vote of the city council, following the procedures outlined in subsections (B) through (G) of this section. 
    If the violation of an approved conditional use is determined by the zoning administrator to threaten the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience or general welfare such that a more expeditious resolution of or action on the violation is necessary, the zoning administrator may, upon written notice to the property owner, refer the matter for a public hearing before the plan commission for consideration of amending, temporarily suspending, or revoking the conditional use without following the provisions of subsection E of this section. Such notice shall be served upon the property owner and permit holder via certified mail a minimum of seventy-two (72) hours prior to conducting the public hearing. Should the property owner or permit holder be located outside the city, such notice shall also be served upon their local agent or operator via certified mail and posted on the property a minimum of seventy-two (72) hours prior to continuing the public hearing. The notice shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing, a description of the subject's property, a description of the conditional use, and a statement of the violation(s). After such hearing, the city council shall act as provided previously above in this subsection, and as provided in subsection F of this section. 
I.  Time Limits on Development of Conditional Use. All approved conditional uses shall be operational within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the date of the approving resolution. Failure to complete development and begin operation within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be defined as the granting of a certificate of occupancy for the conditional use. Prior to such a revocation, the petitioner may request an extension of this period. Such request shall require formal approval by city council and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by city council). 
J.  Discontinuance of an Approved Conditional Use. Any and all conditional uses which have been discontinued for a period exceeding three hundred sixty-five (365) days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this period. 
K.  Change of Ownership. All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property. Modification of any conditional use approved per subsection F of this section, without approval by city council, shall be grounds for revocation of such conditional use approval per subsection H of this section. 
L.  Recordation of Conditional Use Requirements. Except for conditional use approvals for temporary uses, all documents associated with the written description, the approved site plan, and the specific requirements of approval (along with a legal description of the subject property), shall be recorded by the city with the county register of deeds office. 
M.  Fee. One or more fees are required for this procedure. Refer to Section 17.48.050(A)(4). 
N.  A Moratorium on the Issuance of Conditional Use Permits. There shall be a moratorium on the issuance of conditional use permits on lands located within the city of Sun Prairie Westside Neighborhood Land Use Plan and Transportation System Improvement Plan Zoning Map Amendment and Conditional Use Permit Moratorium Overlay District. The lands included in the moratorium are depicted in a map entitled "City of Sun Prairie Westside Neighborhood Land Use and Transportation System Improvement Plan Zoning Map Amendment and Conditional Use Permit Moratorium Overlay District Map." The moratorium shall be in effect until February 5, 2004, or until the city of Sun Prairie Westside Neighborhood Land Use Plan and Transportation System Improvement Plan is adopted by the Sun Prairie common council, whichever comes first. The moratorium shall not apply to lands zoned planned development district on or before September 3, 2002, or to residentially zoned platted lots existing on or before September 3, 2002. Further, the moratorium shall not apply to the issuance of conditional use permits that are necessary to accommodate the construction of public safety facilities, public or private schools, public utilities and nonprofit civic organizations. Unincorporated lands that are located within the planning area for the city of Sun Prairie Westside Neighborhood Land Use and Transportation System Improvement Plan shall become part of the city of Sun Prairie Westside Neighborhood Land Use and Transportation System Improvement Plan Zoning Map Amendment and Conditional Use Permit Moratorium Overlay District upon annexation into the city of Sun Prairie. (Ord. 2003-116 § 2, 2003; Ord. 2003-104 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 2002-55 § 2, 2002; Ord. 528, 2000; prior code § 13-11-5)

F.  Modification of an Approved Site. Any and all variation between development and/or land use activity on the subject property and the approved site plan is a violation of this title. An approved site plan shall be revised and approved via the procedures of subsections (C) and (D) of this section, so as to clearly and completely depict any and all proposed modifications to the previously approved site plan, prior to the initiation of such modifications. 
G.  Fee. No fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 17.48.050(A)(7). (Prior code § 13-11-8) 
17.44.080 - Certificates of occupancy. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations governing the review and approval of certificates of occupancy. This procedure is required to ensure completed development complies with the approved site plan (per the requirements of Section 17.44.070), and the requirements of title as a whole. 
B.  Land Uses and Development Requiring a Certificate of Occupancy. Certificates of occupancy shall be required for any of the following: 
1.  Occupancy and use of a building or structure hereafter erected or structurally altered; 
2.  New occupancy and use of an existing building when the new use is of a different land use classification (a different line in Table 17.16.030); 
3.  Occupancy and use of vacant land; 
4.  New use of vacant land when the new use is of a different land use classification (a different line in Table 17.16.030); 
5.  Any change in the use of a nonconforming use. No such occupancy, use of change of use shall take place until a certificate of occupancy therefor shall have been issued by the building inspection superintendent. 
C.  Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy. 
1.  Every application for a building permit shall also be deemed to be an application for a certificate of occupancy for a new building or for an existing building which is to be substantially altered or enlarged as determined by the zoning administrator. Such certificate shall be issued within ten working days after a written request for the same has been made to the building inspector after the erection or alteration of such building or part thereof has been completed in conformity with the provisions of this title. 
2.  Written application for a certificate of occupancy for the use of vacant land or for a change in the use of land or of a building, or for a change in a nonconforming use, as herein provided, shall be made to the building inspector; if the proposed use is in conformity with the provisions of this title, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued within ten (10) working days after the application therefor has been made. 
3.  Every certificate of occupancy shall state that both the building, and the proposed use of a building or land, substantially complies with all provisions of this title. A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the building inspector and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected. 
D.  Certificate of Occupancy for Legal Nonconforming Uses. Upon application, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued for all lawful nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by adoption of this title, or in existence at the effective date of this title (see Section 17.04.080). Application for such certificate of occupancy for nonconforming use shall be filed with the building inspector by the owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by such nonconforming use within one year of the effective date of this title. It shall be the duty of the building inspector to issue a certificate of occupancy for a legal nonconforming use. Failure to apply for such certificate of occupancy for such nonconforming use shall be prima facie evidence that such nonconforming use was either illegal or did not lawfully exist at the effective date of this title. 
E.  Revocation of a Certificate of Occupancy. It shall constitute a violation of this title for any person, firm, corporation, or voluntary association, either owner or agent, to do any of the things mentioned in subsection B of this section, without having first obtained a certificate of occupancy. Any certificate issued upon a false statement of any fact which is material to the issuance thereof shall be void. Whenever the fact of such false statement shall be established to the satisfaction of the building inspector, he or she shall forthwith revoke the certificate of occupancy, by notice in writing to be delivered by him or her to the holder of the void certificate upon the premises where the violation has occurred, or if such holder be not found there, by mailing the notice of revocation by certified letter to his or her last known address. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with such work or use without having obtained a new certificate of occupancy shall be deemed guilty of violation of this title. 
F.  Fee. A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 17.48.050(A)(8). (Prior code § 13-11-9) 
17.44.090 - Variances. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and decide requests for permitted variation from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this title shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; as provided for by Section 62.23(7)(e)7., Wisconsin Statutes. 
B.  Initiation of Request for Approval of a Variance. Proceedings for approval of a requested variance shall be initiated by: 
1.  A petition of the owner(s) of the subject property; 
2.  A recommendation of the plan commission; 
3.  By action of the city council. 
C.  Application Requirements. All applications for requested variances, regardless of the party of their initiation per subsection B of this section, shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and shall be accompanied by all of the following: 
1.  A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the variance is proposed, and all other lands within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on such map as the same appear on the current records of the register of deeds of Dane County (as determined by the city). Such map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Such map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals eight hundred (800) feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
2.  A map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation to the city as a whole; 
3.  A written description of the proposed variance describing the type of specific requirements of the variance proposed for the subject property; 
4.  A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Such site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of Section 17.44.070(C); 
5.  Written justification for the requested variance. (The petitioner is advised to use the requirements of subsection D.2., of this section, to develop such written justification.) 
D.  Review by City Staff. The requested variance shall be reviewed by city staff in the following steps: 
1.  First, the zoning administrator shall review the submittal in order to ensure that all required portions of the submittal are provided; 
2.  Second, upon the receipt and acknowledgment of a complete submittal, city staff shall undertake a review of the submittal which shall evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed variance provided in the submittal per subsection (C)(5) of this section. Furthermore, such review shall evaluate the submittal based on the following questions: 
a.  What exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or special factors are present which apply only to the subject property? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how the subject property contains factors which are not present on other properties in the same zoning district. Specifically: 
i.  The hardship or difficulty shall be peculiar to the subject property and different from that of other properties, and not one which affects all properties similarly. Such a hardship or difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual shape of the original acreage parcel; unusual topography or elevation; or because the property was created before the passage of the current, applicable zoning regulations, and is not economically suitable for a permitted use or will not accommodate a structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area, yard, green space, and setback requirements are observed; 
ii.  Loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not, in and of itself be grounds for a variance; 
iii.  Self-imposed hardship shall not be grounds for a variance. Reductions resulting from the sale of portions of a property reducing the remainder of such property below buildable size or cutting-off existing access to a public right-of-way or deed restrictions imposed by the owner's predecessor in title are considered to be such self-imposed hardships; 
iv.  Violations by, or variances granted to, neighboring properties shall not justify a variance; 
v.  The alleged hardship shall not be one that would have existed in the absence of a zoning ordinance. 
b.  In what manner do the factors identified in subsection D.2.a., of this section, prohibit the development of the subject property in a manner similar to that of other properties under the same zoning district? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how the requested variance is essential to make the subject property developable so that property rights enjoyed by the owners of similar properties can be enjoyed by the owners of the subject property. 
c.  Would the granting of the proposed variance be of substantial detriment to adjacent properties? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial impact on adjacent properties. 
d.  Would the granting of the proposed variance as depicted on the required site plan (see subsection C.4., of this section) result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other matters effecting the public health, safety, or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of the intent, provisions, and policies of this title, the comprehensive plan, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how the proposed variance will have no substantial impact on such long-range planning matters. 
e.  Have the factors which present the reason for the proposed variance been created by the act of the petitioner or previous property owner or their agent (for example: previous development decisions such as building placement, floor plan, or orientation, lotting pattern, or grading) after the effective date of this title (see Section 17.04.080)? The response to this question shall clearly indicate that such factors existed prior to the effective date of this title and were not created by action of the petitioner, a previous property owner, or their agent. 
f.  Does the proposed variance involve the regulations of Section 17.16.030 (Table of Land Uses)? The response to this question shall clearly indicate that the requested variance does not involve the provisions of this section. 
3.  Third, a staff report shall be forwarded to the board of zoning appeals for review and action. 
E.  Review and Determination by Board of Zoning Appeals. 
1.  Within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the complete petition as determined by the zoning administrator, the board of zoning appeals shall hold a public hearing. Notice of the requested variance and the hearing shall conform to the requirements of Section 62.23(7)(d), Wisconsin Statutes. Such notice shall contain a description of the subject property and the proposed variance per subsections C.1. and 3., of this section. In addition, at least ten (10) days before such hearing, the city clerk shall mail an identical notice to the petitioner of the proposed variance; to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within one thousand (1,000) feet of any portion of the subject property; and to all property owners within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the subject property as identified in subsection C.1., of this section. Failure to mail such notice, provided it is unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this section. 
2.  Within thirty (30) days after the holding of the public hearing (per subsection E.1., of this section, or, within an extension of such period approved by the petitioner and granted by the board of zoning appeals), the board of zoning appeals make its findings per subsection D., of this section, and its determination regarding the petition as a whole. The board of zoning appeals may request further information and/or additional reports from city staff and/or the petitioner. The board of zoning appeals may take final action on the request for approval of the requested variance at time of its initial meeting, or such proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further consideration. The board of zoning appeals shall make a written report of its findings and determinations following its determination. 
3.  The petitioner may request to waive or extend any of the deadlines noted in subsections E.1. and 2., of this section, by submitting such request in writing to the zoning administrator. 
4.  If the board of zoning appeals fails to make a determination within thirty (30) days after such public hearing, then the request for the variance shall be considered denied. 
5.  Such report shall include a formal findings of facts developed and approved by the zoning board of appeals concerning the requirements of subsection D.2.a. through f., of this section. 
F.  Effect of Denial. No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the board of zoning appeals. 
G.  Limited Effect of a Variance. Where the board of zoning appeals has granted a variance, such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it any status as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting of a variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed variance. 
H.  Stay of Proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furthering enforcement of any provisions of this title from which the petitioner is requesting a variance, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of zoning appeals after the request for the variance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of zoning appeals, or by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning administrator, and on due cause shown. 
I.  Fee. A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 17.48.050(A)(9). 
(Ord. 247, § 1, 3-21-2006; Prior code § 13-11-10) 
17.44.100 - Interpretations. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this title and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation. 
B.  Initiation of Request for an Interpretation. Proceedings for an interpretation shall be initiated by: 
1.  A petition of the owner(s) of the subject property; 
2.  A recommendation of the plan commission; 
3.  By action of the city council; 
4.  By a request by city staff. 
C.  Application Requirements. All applications for interpretations, regardless of the party of their initiation per subsection B., of this section, shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and shall be accompanied by all of the following: 
1.  All requests for interpretations shall clearly indicate the part of the text of this title for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the petitioner has regarding such text. 
2.  If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this title to a specific property, the additional following information shall be required: 
a.  A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the interpretation is requested, and all other lands within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on such map as the same appear on the current records of the register of deeds of Dane County as provided by the city. Such map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Such map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals eight hundred (800) feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
b.  A map of the generalized location of the subject property in relation to the city as a whole; 
c.  A written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities, buildings, and structures currently located on, and proposed for, the subject property; 
d.  A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Such site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of Section 17.44.070(C). 
3.  If the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this title, a series of written responses to the following questions: 
a.  How is the subject land use (in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the city of Sun Prairie comprehensive plan, this title, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city? 
b.  How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought? 
c.  Do the potential public benefits of the proposed land use outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed land use? 
D.  Review by Zoning Administrator. 
1.  First, the zoning administrator shall review the submittal in order to ensure that all required portions of the submittal are provided; 
2.  Second, upon the receipt and acknowledgment of a complete submittal, and within thirty (30) days of such receipt, the zoning administrator shall undertake a review of the submittal which shall evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed interpretation provided in the submittal per subsection C of this section. This review shall also take into consideration the standards for review presented in subsection E of this section. 
3.  Third, a staff report shall be forwarded to the petitioner indicating the interpretation of the zoning administrator. 
E.  Standards for Review of Requested Interpretations. This title shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the city of Sun Prairie city council as noted in this title and the comprehensive plan. The intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed, modified, or existing land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows: 
1.  Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation is required. 
    Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated. 
2.  Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. 
    Rationale: There is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use, and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the title. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title is to be prohibited. 
3.  Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land use proposal. 
    Rationale: If an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party (either the adjoining landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title. 
    Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title. Any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements and power to the public exercise this in order protect the public. 
4.  This title has been carefully designed by the city council to combine maximum achievement of public goals, and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan for the city. Great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options. Persons interpreting this title should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the city council. 
5.  In addition to the petitioner's response to the questions required by subsection C of this section, the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters: 
a.  No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the city council on an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance, the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation. 
b.  No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use, or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property (see Section 17.16.030). 
c.  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject property's zoning district (see Sections 17.16.030 and 17.16.060). 
d.  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in such district, or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category (see Sections 17.12.020 and 17.16.020). 
e.  If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject property's district than to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to Section 17.44.050. 
F.  Effect of a Favorable Land Use Interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this title. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to required site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and certificates of occupancy. 
G.  Limitations on Favorable Land Use Interpretation. 
1.  No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit is issued and development is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. 
2.  An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days or more. 
H.  Fee. A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 17.48.050(A)(10). (Prior code § 13-11-11)

If such an application is conditionally approved and corrections are needed prior to final plan approval, then the zoning administrator shall review the revisions with five business days from the date the revised information is submitted. The zoning administrator shall either issue the zoning permit or a written explanation as to why the permit was not issued.

The resolution shall specify the extenuating circumstances or hardship that lead to the need to adopt a resolution under this paragraph. 
(Ord. 565, § 1, 6-17-2014; Ord. 326, § 1, 8-21-2007; Ord. 189, § 1, 4-19-2005) 
18.04.100 - Impact fees established. 
A.  Westside Transportation System Impact Fee. The following city documents on file at the office of the city clerk contain the needs assessment for the impact fees listed under this subsection and document city compliance with the procedural requirements of Section 66.0617, Wisconsin Statutes. 
1.  The public needs assessment entitled: "City of Sun Prairie: Report on Traffic Impact Fees," dated February 21, 2005, and revised April 18, 2005, prepared by Virchow, Krause & Company, LLP and revised on March 14, 2008 and March 20, 2014, by MSA Professional Services and revised on February 11, 2016 by the city of Sun Prairie. 
2.  Public hearing notice, February 24, 2005, and March 3, 2005. 
3.  Minutes of the March 23, 2005, special common council meeting: public hearing. 
4.  Impact Fee Boundary. The impact fees for the Westside Transportation System will be imposed in the geographic area as described on the map included in Section A, as Figure A of the public needs assessment, as revised on March 14, 2008, a copy of which can be found in the city clerk's office. 
5.  Public hearing notice, March 27, 2008, and April 3, 2008. 
6.  Minutes of the April 22, 2008, special common council meeting: public hearing. 
7.  Public hearing notice, March 14, 2014. 
8.  Minutes of the March 25, 2014 committee of the whole meeting: public hearing. 
9.  Public hearing notice, February 5, 2016. 
10.  Minutes of the February 16, 2016 committee of the whole meeting: public hearing. 
11.  The fee for the Westside traffic impact fee shall be seventy-eight dollars and fifty-six cents ($78.56) per vehicle trip. To determine the specific impact fee for land use, the cost per trip, seventy-eight dollars and fifty-six cents ($78.56) must be multiplied times the average vehicle trips for each land use as defined in the Trip Generation Manual. For example, the impact fee for single-family detached housing is $78.56 x 9.52 (daily trips) = $748.00. For a single-tenant office building the Trip Generation Manual provides that 11.65 trips are generated per one thousand (1,000) square feet. Therefore, to determine the impact fee for a five thousand (5,000) square foot single-tenant office building, the calculation is as follows: 5 x 11.65 (daily trips) x $78.56 = $4,575.00. The impact fee schedule appears in Section D, as Table 6 of the public needs assessment. 
B.  Imposition and Payment of Westside Transportation System Impact Fee. The Westside Transportation Impact Fee shall be imposed at the time of issuance of any building permit for new construction on vacant land, the construction of additional buildings on developed land, and the expansion of existing buildings located within the Westside Transportation Impact Fee Boundary. The following parameters shall be followed: 
1.  For multi-tenant retail buildings, the developer shall have the option of paying said transportation impact fee at the time of the initial building permit under ITE Code 826, Specialty Retail Center, provided the fee is paid in full for the gross square footage of the entire building; or deferring the fee to be paid on a unit-by-unit basis as building permits are requested to finish out each retail space. If the fee is paid under ITE Code 826, and the building includes provisions for a drive-through window, a total of one thousand (1,000) square feet of the gross floor area of the building shall be charged under ITE Code 934, Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Through Window. If the fee is deferred, fees shall be determined based on the specific uses to be established in each retail space and collected individually as permits for each space are issued. 
2.  Within mixed use buildings that contain residential or office uses above first floor commercial uses, the fee for the upper floor use(s) shall be based on the specific use(s) located on said upper floors. 
3.  The land use classification that shall apply to a proposed use shall be determined by the impact fee administrator. In making this determination, the impact fee administrator shall first consult Table 6, Section D of the Needs Assessment Report to determine the land use category that best fits the proposed use, but may also consult the land use descriptions contained within the trip generation manuals to determine whether a better comparable category exists upon which to calculate the impact fee. Decisions of the impact fee administrator may be appealed to the finance committee and common council per Section 18.04.110. 
4.  In no event shall a building permit be issued unless the impact fee has been collected. 
C.  Park Impact Fee. The following city documents on file at the office of the city clerk contain the needs assessment for the impact fees listed under this subsection and document city compliance with the procedural requirements of Section 66.0617, Wisconsin Statutes. 
1.  The public needs assessment entitled: "City of Sun Prairie: Report on Park Impact Fees," dated April 24, 2007, prepared by Virchow, Krause & Company, LLP. 
2.  Public hearing notice, May 23 and May 30, 2007. 
3.  Minutes of the June 19, 2007, meeting of the committee of the whole: public hearing. 
4.  Impact Fee Boundary. The park impact fees will be imposed on all residential development within the city limits. 
5.  The park impact fee for single-family and multifamily dwelling units shall be four hundred eighty dollars ($480.00) for park development and improvements and one thousand two hundred twenty dollars ($1,220.00) for land costs per dwelling unit. The park impact fee for assisted living shall be one hundred ninety dollars ($190.00) for park development and improvements and four hundred seventy dollars ($470.00) for land costs per dwelling unit. These fees are based on the fee schedule appearing in Appendix A of the "City of Sun Prairie Report on Park Impact Fees" with a discount of approximately fourteen percent (14%). The impact fee shall be adjusted annually by the Construction Cost Index to account for changes in costs effective January 1st of each year. 
D.  Imposition and Payment of Park Impact Fee. 
1.  On all residential uses and mixed uses (a combination of commercial and residential in the same building) the impact fee shall be imposed and must be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(Ord. 633, § 1, 3-1-2016; Ord. 565, § 1, 6-17-2014; Ord. 359, § 1, 4-22-2008; Ord. 326, § 1, 8-21-2007; Ord. 189, § 1, 4-19-2005) 
18.04.110 - Appeal. 
    A developer upon whom an impact fee is imposed shall have the right to contest the amount, collection or use of any impact fee imposed under this title by filing a written notice of appeal with the impact fee administrator, as outlined below: 
A.  An appeal may be made within thirty (30) days after payment of the fee is made to the city, in which case the developer may proceed with construction while said appeal is under consideration, or 
B.  An appeal may be filed prior to the payment being received by the city. In this event no building permit shall be issued until the appeal is acted upon by the common council and the appropriate fee, if any, is paid to the city, and 
C.  Upon the filing of a timely appeal, the appeal shall be reviewed by the city finance committee, who shall provide the developer with notice and an opportunity to be heard and then make a recommendation to the common council, and 
D.  The common council shall make a determination on timely appeals within ninety (90) days of the date of the filing of the notice of appeal. The common council of city may affirm, negate or modify the impact fee. 
(Ord. 565, § 1, 6-17-2014; Ord. 189, § 1, 4-19-2005)
