§ 260-7. Establishment of districts.
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplainadjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
The flood-fringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits andthe floodway.
The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered byfloodwater during the regional flood.
§ 260-8. Locating floodplain boundaries.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditionsshall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection A or B below. If a significant difference exists, themap shall be amended according to Article
VIII
. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundaryderived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a zoning compliance permit, whether or not a mapamendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actualpredevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined andfor initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the ZoningAdministrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to §

and the criteria in Subsection
A
and
B
below.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the districtboundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. (Note:Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA mustalso approve any map amendment pursuant to § 260-42F.)
Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the mapscale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.

Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders whoprey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexualoffenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses; and mostsexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims that are never reported, and areprosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimizationto society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is the intent of this article not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the City'scompelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizensof the City.

This article sets uniform requirements for discharging waters and wastes into the public seweragesystem within the City. This section enables the City to protect public health in conformity withadministrative provisions, water quality requirements and other discharge criteria, which are requiredor authorized by local, state and federal law. The objectives of this section are as follows:
To regulate the construction and use of public and private sewers and drains.
To provide for annexations and connections to the public sewerage system.
To provide a means of determining wastewater volumes, constituents and characteristics, and toissue permits to certain users.
To set limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters dischargedto the system to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater treatment facilities whichwill interfere with the normal adequate treatment in the wastewater facilities, pass through thesystem into the receiving waters, or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge.
To recover from users of the wastewater treatment facilities, on an equitable basis, the share ofthe wastewater treatment facilities costs attributable to such users and to provide funds for theoperation and maintenance, debt retirement and replacement of the wastewater facilities.
To set penalties for violations of the requirements of this article, and to set forth collection ofnonpayment of bills.
§ 455-14. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existingeasements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, ordinances or permitspreviously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, wherever this article imposes greaterrestrictions, the provisions of this article shall govern.
§ 455-15. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimumrequirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the utility and shall not be deemed a limitationor repeal of any other power granted by the statutes of the State of Wisconsin.
§ 455-16. Revenues and rate design.
Users of the Oconto Falls wastewater treatment system shall be charged a rate which will recover allcosts of operation and maintenance, replacement fund deposits, and debt retirement costs. The rateshall be determined on a cost of service basis and shall be reviewed annually to determine if the totalrevenue is sufficient to cover all of the aforesaid costs. The rate shall be such that a proportionatedistribution of all costs is charged to each user class.
User volume charge. It is assumed that biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids,phosphorous and other pollutant concentrations discharged to the sewer system from all userclassifications are approximately equal and proportional to volume. Therefore, the user chargeswill be developed on a volume basis in accordance with the following formula: user's volumecharge per 1,000 cubic feet (Cu) for operation and maintenance and replacement costs is equal tothe total annual cost (Ct) of operation and maintenance and replacement costs divided by the totalvolume contribution (Vt) in thousands of cubic feet from all users annually, thus: Cu = Ct/Vt (Ctand Vt shall not include the I/I component). The user volume charge shall be paid monthly.

Fixed user charge. The fixed user charge includes debt retirement costs. The fixed user charge isallocated to each sewer user according to a fixed charge for each water meter size. The fixed usercharge is divided by the total number of user charge meter equivalents (UCME) in the sewerservice area. The fixed user charge shall be paid monthly.
Surcharge rate. A surcharge shall be added to the volume charge to any users whose wastewaterpollutant concentrations exceed those of normal domestic sewage as determined by a calculationusing the WWTP influent loadings and water use discharged to the sewer system. The followingunit surcharge costs are hereby established:
Suspended solids greater than 367 parts per million (ppm): $0.86 per pound.
BOD greater than 396 ppm: $0.88 per pound.
Phosphorus (P) greater than 7.5 ppm: $6.46 per pound.
Total user charge.
The wastewater user charge shall be billed monthly and shall be the sum of the:
User volume charge.
Fixed user charge.
A surcharge as applicable.
To allow for typical domestic summer water consumption which does not reach the disposalsystem (lawn and garden watering, etc.) the utility will use second quarter meter readings forcomputing third quarter bills whenever third quarter volumes exceed second quarter volumes.
Annual review. The revenue generated by the user charge system will be reviewed annually foradequacy, and the rates will be adjusted when required.
Accounting.
All user charge moneys shall be placed in the sewage disposal account to cover the costs ofoperation and maintenance, replacement, fund deposits, and debt retirement payments.
Expenditures shall be made from the account by the City Administrator - Clerk/Treasurer inaccordance with the detailed annual budget prepared by the Sewage Disposal Commission.
A replacement reserve account shall be established and expenditures from it shall be only formaking renewals to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property thatwould result in an extended useful life or meet the anticipated useful life.
§ 455-17. Conditions for discharge into treatment system.
Public wastewater collection facilities are required to be used for the deposit of human wastes,garbage or other liquid wastes that cannot be discharged into a receiving stream or disposed of inany other manner in accordance with federal and state statutes and state administrativeregulations and approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

Telecommunications and radio towers shall be constructed out of metal or other nonflammablematerial, unless specifically permitted by the City to be otherwise.
Telecommunication and radio support facilities (i.e., equipment rooms, utilities, and equipmentenclosures) shall be constructed out of nonreflective materials (visible exterior services only) tothe greatest extent possible and, where possible, shall be sited below the ridge line or designed tominimize their impact.
Telecommunication and radio equipment buildings, shelters and cabinets shall be designed andfinished to appear as nearly as possible like other buildings or facilities found in the area.
The City shall have the authority to require reasonable special design (materials, architecturalfeatures and color) of telecommunication facilities where findings of particular sensitivity are made(e.g., proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views and/or community features).
Telecommunication facilities and towers, and radio facilities and towers, shall ensure that sufficientanti-climbing measures have been incorporated into the facility or tower as needed to reduce thepotential for trespass and injury.
Equipment buildings shall be located, designed and screened to reduce the visual impact to theextent feasible considering the technological requirements of the proposed personal wirelessservices and the need to be compatible with neighboring residences and the character of thecommunity.
Antennas shall be designed to blend with their supporting structure. The color selected shall beone that, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, will minimize the visibility of the antennas tothe greatest extent feasible.
§ 480-43. Location.
All new telecommunication facilities and radio towers shall be located so as to minimize their visibilityand the number of tower sites. To this end, a good faith effort in achieving co-location shall be requiredof the requestor and host entity, subject to existing co-location contracts, and all of the followingmeasures shall be implemented for telecommunication facilities in addition to meeting the conditionaluse standards in §
480-39D
of this article:
No telecommunication or radio tower shall be installed closer than 1/4 mile to anothertelecommunication tower, measured from the base of the telecommunication tower to the base ofthe proposed tower, unless it is a tower situated on a multi-tower zoning lot or credible evidence toa reasonable degree of certainty acceptable to the Planning Commission is submitted to showboth a clear need for the proposed location of the new tower and that it is not feasible to co-locateit on an existing site.
No telecommunications or radio tower shall be installed on a zoning lot that is not alreadydeveloped with a telecommunications tower unless the applicant demonstrates that no tower inthe area in which the applicant's equipment must be located is of sufficient height to meet theapplicant's requirements and the deficiency in height cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost; orthe existing tower is not of sufficient strength to support the applicant's equipment and thedeficiency in structural strength cannot be remedied at a reasonable cost; or the applicant'sequipment would cause electromagnetic interference with equipment on the existingtelecommunications tower(s) within the area in which the applicant's equipment must be located;or the equipment on the existing telecommunications tower(s) would cause interference with theapplicant's equipment and the interference, from whatever source, cannot be eliminated at areasonable cost; or the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to co-locate on an existing communication tower are unreasonable relative to industry norms; or theapplicant demonstrates that there are other factors that render existing communication towers

unsuitable or unavailable and establishes that the public interest is best served by the placementor construction of a new telecommunications tower.
No telecommunications or radio tower shall be located on a lot in a residential or commercialdistrict.
Telecommunications and radio towers, guy wires, appurtenant equipment and buildings shallcomply with the yard and setback requirements of the zoning district in which they are located,and, in addition thereto, all telecommunications towers and radio towers shall be set back at leastone 100 feet from any property devoted to residential use or 250 feet from any residential building,whichever is less.
§ 480-44. Co-located and multiple user facilities.
Unless the applicant is submitting an application to locate or co-locate upon an existing tower orstructure, an analysis shall be prepared by or on behalf of the applicant; subject to the approval ofthe Planning Commission, which identifies all reasonable technically feasible alternative locationsand/or facilities which would be usable for the proposed personal wireless services. The intentionof the alternatives analysis is to present alternative strategies which should minimize the number,size and adverse environmental impacts, including aesthetics, of facilities and towers necessary toprovide the needed services to the City and surrounding rural and urban areas. The analysis shalladdress the potential for co-location at an existing or new site and the potential to locate facilitiesand towers as close as possible to the intended service areas. It shall also explain the rationale forselection of the proposed site in view of the relative merits of any of the feasible alternatives.Approval of the project is subject to the Planning Commission making a finding that the proposedsite results in fewer or less severe environmental impacts, including aesthetics, than any feasiblealternative site. The City may require independent verification by a qualified engineer of thisanalysis at the applicant's expense. In regard to facilities that are not proposed to be co-locatedwith another telecommunications facility or tower, the applicant shall provide a written explanationwhy the subject facility is not a candidate for co-location.
All new telecommunications towers shall be structurally and electrically designed to accommodateat least three separate antenna arrays, unless credible evidence is presented that suchconstruction is economically and technologically not feasible or the Planning Commissiondetermines that for reasons of aesthetics a telecommunications tower of sufficient height toaccommodate three antenna arrays is unwarranted.
Multi-user telecommunications towers shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement ofantennas and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights. Parking areas, access roads, andutility easements shall be shared by site users, at fair market rates as determined by customaryindustry standards, when in the determination of the Planning Commission this will minimizeoverall visual impact to the community.
§ 480-45. Exempt facilities.
The following facilities and towers are exempt from the operation of this article:
Amateur radio towers installed, erected, maintained and/or operated in any residential zoningdistrict by a federally licensed amateur radio operator and complying with the provisions of thischapter, so long as all of the following conditions are met:
The antenna involved is accessory to the primary use of the property which is not atelecommunications facility;
In a residential zone, no more than one support structure for a licensed amateur radiooperator is allowed on the parcel;
