PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Hartland, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1991 Code, as supplemented through Ord. No. 635-99, July 12, 1999. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1991 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David Poucher, Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Connie Casper, Clerk, and Hector de la Mora and Paul Alexy, Village Attorneys, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

In default of payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution such person shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such forfeiture and costs are paid, but not exceeding 90 days; and not exceeding the penalty authorized by statute, except that the person reduces the amount owed at a rate of at least $25.00 for each day of imprisonment, including imprisonment after arrest.

    Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the village may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the village board to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Whenever any person fails to pay any forfeiture and costs of prosecution upon the order of any court for violation of any provision of this Code or ordinance of the village, the court may, in lieu of ordering imprisonment of the defendant, or after the defendant has been released from custody, issue an execution against the property of the defendant for such forfeiture and costs.

(4)  The section of the Code or ordinance violated.

(6)  The time at which the alleged violator may appear in court. 
(7)  A statement which in essence informs the alleged violator that: 
a.  A cash deposit based on the schedule established by resolution may be made which shall be delivered or mailed to the clerk of municipal court prior to the time of the scheduled court appearance. 
b.  If a cash deposit is made, no appearance in court is necessary unless subsequently summoned. 
c.  If a cash deposit is made and the alleged violator does not appear in court, the nonappearance will be deemed a plea of no contest for which a forfeiture not to exceed the amount of the deposit is submitted including statutory assessments, or, if the court does not accept the plea of no contest, a summons will be issued ordering the alleged violator to appear in court to answer the complaint. 
(b)  If the alleged violator does not make a cash deposit and fails to appear in court at the time specified in the citation, the court may issue a summons or warrant for the defendant's arrest or consider the nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and enter judgment accordingly if service was completed as provided by law, and may commence an action for collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and crime laboratories and drug law enforcement and any applicable domestic abuse assessment. The village may commence action under Wis. Stats. § 66.12(1). The citation may be used as the complaint in the action for the collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and crime laboratories and drug law enforcement assessment and any applicable domestic abuse assessment. If the court considers the nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and enters judgment accordingly, the court shall promptly mail a copy or notice of the judgment to the defendant. The judgment shall allow the defendant not less than 20 days from the date of the judgment to pay any forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and crime laboratories and drug law enforcement assessment and any applicable domestic abuse assessment imposed. If the defendant moves to open the judgment within six months after the court appearance date fixed in the citation, and show to the satisfaction of the court that the failure to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, the court shall reopen the judgment, accept a not guilty plea and set a trial date. 
(c)  A direction that if the alleged violator elects to make a cash deposit, the statement which accompanies the citation shall be signed to indicate that the statement required under subsection (a)(7) of this section has been read. Such statement shall be sent or brought with the cash deposit. 
(d)  Such other information as the village deems necessary shall be supplied. 
(e)  Deposits shall be made in cash, money order, check, or credit card to the village police department or the clerk of municipal court who shall provide a receipt therefor. 
(f)  The schedule of citation deposits set forth in Appendix B to the Code of Ordinances, and as modified by resolution of the village board of trustees from time-to-time, is established for use with citations issued under this Code.

A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the village attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 2-331. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied, in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. 
(Code 1991, § 3.08(5)) 
Sec. 2-331. - Limitations upon access and withholding. 
(a)  Application of other laws. Any record which is specifically exempted for disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law is exempt from disclosure under this article, except that any portion of that record which contains public information is open to public inspection as provided in subsection (f) of this section. 
(b)  Law enforcement records. Except as otherwise provided by law, whenever federal law or regulations require, or as a condition to receipt of aids by the village require that any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes be withheld from public access, then that information is exempt from disclosure under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1). 
(c)  Contractors' records. Each authority shall make available for inspection and copying under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1) any record produced or collected under a contract entered into by the authority with a person other than an authority to the same extent as if the record were maintained by the authority. This subsection does not apply to the inspection or copying of a record under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(am). 
(d)  Computer programs and data. A computer program, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 16.971(4)(c), is not subject to examination or copying under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1), but the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to the right of examination and copying, except as otherwise provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35 or this article. 
(e)  Trade secrets. An authority may withhold access to any record or portion of a record containing information qualifying as a trade secret as defined in Wis. Stats. § 134.90(1)(c). 
(f)  Separation of information. If a record contains information that is subject to disclosure under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(a) or (am) and information that is not subject to such disclosure, the authority having custody of the record shall provide the information that is subject to disclosure and delete the information that is not subject to disclosure from the record before release. 
(g)  Identities of applicants for public positions. 
(1)  In this section, the term "final candidate" means each applicant for a position that is seriously considered for appointment or whose name is certified for appointment and whose name is submitted for final consideration to an authority for appointment to any state position, except a position in the classified service, or to any local public office, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.42(7w). The term "final candidate" includes, whenever there are at least five candidates for an office or position, each of the five candidates who are considered most qualified for the office or position by an authority, and whenever there are less than five candidates for an office or position, each such candidate. Whenever an appointment is to be made from a group of more than five candidates, the term "final candidate" also includes each candidate in the group. 
(2)  Every applicant for a position with any authority may indicate in writing to the authority that the applicant does not wish the authority to reveal his identity. Except with respect to an applicant whose name is certified for appointment to a position in the state classified service or a final candidate, if an applicant makes such an indication in writing, the authority shall not provide access to any record related to the application that may reveal the identity of the applicant. 
(h)  Identities of law enforcement informants. 
(1)  In this subsection: 
a.  The term "informant" means an individual who request confidentiality from a law enforcement agency in conjunction with providing information to that agency or, pursuant to an express promise of confidentiality by a law enforcement agency or under circumstances in which a promise of confidentiality would reasonably be implied, provides information to a law enforcement agency or, is working with a law enforcement agency to obtain information, related in any case to any of the following: 
1.  Another person who the individual or the law enforcement agency suspects has violated, is violating or will violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
2.  Past, present or future activities that the individual or law enforcement agency believes may violate a federal law, a law of any state or an ordinance of any local government. 
b.  The term "law enforcement agency" has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 165.83(1)(b), and includes the department of corrections. 
(2)  If an authority that is a law enforcement agency receives a request to inspect or copy a record or portion of a record under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1)(a) that contains specific information including, but not limited to, a name, address, telephone number, voice recording or handwriting sample which, if disclosed, could identify an informant, the authority shall delete the portion of the record in which the information is contained or, if no portion of the record can be inspected or copied without identifying the informant, shall withhold the record unless the legal custodian of the record, designated under Wis. Stats. § 19.33, makes a determination, at the time that the request is made, that the public interest in allowing a person to inspect, copy or receive a copy of such identifying information outweighs the harm done to the public interest by providing such access. 
(i)  Refusal of disclosure. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the village attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them. 
(2)  Records of current deliberations after a quasijudicial hearing. 
(3)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline of any village officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a village officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure. 
(4)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. 
(5)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of village property, investing of village funds or other village business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure. 
(6)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data. 
(7)  Communications between legal counsel for the village and any officer, agent or employee of the village, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the village or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(j)  Partial disclosure. If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the village attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the village attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the village attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

"N/A" indicates not applicable and applies to all records designated for permanent retention. 
(c)  Destruction after request for inspection. No requested record may be destroyed until after the request is granted or 60 days after the request is denied. If an action is to commence under Wis. Stats. § 19.37, the requested record may not be destroyed until a court order is issued and all appeals have been completed. 
(d)  Destruction pending litigation. No record subject to pending litigation shall be destroyed until the litigation has been resolved. 
(e)  Microfilming records. Any police department records can be kept on microfilm provided the applicable standards established in Wis. Stats. § 16.61(7) are met.

ARTICLE VII. - PROPERTY DISPOSAL 

Sec. 2-386. - Abandoned property. 
    Lost money or goods discovered, received, or recovered by any village officer, agent, or employee shall be transferred to the custody of the police department for disposition under the terms of this section. 
(1)  Public notice. The police department shall cause notice of lost money of $25.00 or more or goods discovered, received, or recovered under this section having a value of at least $25.00 to be posted in two public places in the village for 90 days as required under Wis. Stats. ch. 170. 
(2)  Upon the expiration of the 90-day notice period called for under subsection (1) of this section, the finder of the money or goods shall become the owner of such property as set forth in Wis. Stats. ch. 170. The finder shall, as a condition to ownership, claim the money or goods at the village police department within 30 days and sign a receipt. 
(3)  In the event a finder fails to claim the goods or money within 30 days after the expiration of the 90-day notice period, or if the finder is an officer, agent, or employee of the village, the property shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of in one of the following ways: 
a.  By sale. The police department may advertise the property to be sold, or cause the property to be advertised and seek sealed bids when the property would not be sold for its obvious value through auction and its sale in this manner is deemed in the best interests of the public. The police department may accept or reject any or all bids, but shall sell the property to the person who makes the highest acceptable bid. Such sales shall be conducted by the chief of police or his or her designee. 
1.  All property sold in this manner shall be recorded on an inventory filed with the village clerk. This inventory shall include a description of the property, a record of the date and method of sale, the name and address of the buyer, and the amount paid to the village for the property sold. 
2.  Records of these sales shall be retained in accordance with section 2-328. 
3.  All receipts from such sale after deducting the necessary expenses of storing the property and conducting the sale, if any, shall be paid into the general fund of the village treasury. 
b.  By public auction. The police department may dispose of the property by holding an annual public auction. The abandoned property shall be sold to the person who makes the highest bid at the auction. Such auction shall be conducted under the supervision of the police chief or his or her designee. All receipts from such auction shall be paid into the general fund of the village treasury after deducting the necessary expenses of storing the property and conducting the auction, if any. 
c.  Donation of recovered bicycles to charitable organization. Any bicycle having an estimated value of less than $100.00 may be donated to a non-profit charitable organization if, in the discretion of the chief of police, the cost of holding a sale or public auction under subsections (3)a. and b. of this section would exceed the value of the bicycle. 
(4)  Employees, officers, and agents of the village may participate in sales conducted under section (3)a. and auctions conducted under (3)b. of this section.

Sec. 26-21. - Findings. 
(a)  The board of trustees hereby finds, determines and declares that the undertaking of programs and projects for blight elimination and prevention, redevelopment and community development and redevelopment within the area of the village described on Exhibit A (collectively, qualified redevelopment projects on file in the clerk's office) will encourage well-planned, stable, adequate places of employment for the people of the village and an increase in the general property tax base of the village. 
(b)  The board of trustees hereby finds, determines and declares that there exists within the area of the village described on Exhibit A a need for qualified redevelopment projects, and that creation of a community development authority authorized to act in this area will serve the public interest. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(1), (2)) 
Sec. 26-22. - Creation. 
    Pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 66.436 and 66.4325, the board of trustees creates a community development authority which authority shall be known as the Community Development Authority of the Village of Hartland, Wisconsin. Such authority (the authority) shall be a separate body politic for the purpose of carrying out qualified redevelopment projects within the area described on Exhibit A, and shall have all powers, duties and functions of community development authorities contained in Wis. Stats. § 66.4325, as it now exists with the exception of the power of eminent domain as otherwise limited by this article. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(3)) 
Sec. 26-23. - Adoption of bylaws. 
    As a means of more clearly setting forth its powers and rules of procedure, the community development authority shall adopt a set of bylaws which shall, among other things, establish the general policy duties and provide for the appointment of the chairperson, treasurer, secretary and executive director. The initial bylaws and subsequent amendments must also be approved by a majority vote of the board of trustees. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(4)) 
Sec. 26-24. - Composition; terms. 
    The community development authority will consist of seven members appointed by the village president subject to confirmation by the board of trustees. Two of the commissioners shall be members of the board of trustees and shall serve on the authority during their respective terms of office as board members. The terms of the nonboard commissioners shall be four years and until their successors are appointed and qualified. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(5)) 
Sec. 26-25. - Qualifications of members. 
    Except for the two commissioners who are members of the board of trustees, the commissioners shall have qualifications consisting of ability and experience in the fields of community development, financing, accounting and community planning, and shall particularly have experience in the creation of jobs and tax base through commercial and light industrial development. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(6)) 
Sec. 26-26. - Scope of authority to act. 
(a)  The area specified in Exhibit A is the only area within the village in which the community development authority is authorized to act. The board of trustees finds that this area is in need of the assistance that a community development authority can provide, but the board of trustees does not find the existence of such need in any other area of the village at this time. The authority of the community development authority to act or undertake projects in any other area of the village can only be acquired through an amendment to this article. 
(b)  The community development authority is not granted the authority to act as the agent of the village in planning and carrying out community development programs and activities under the Federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, nor is it authorized to act as agent of the village to perform the acts which may otherwise be performed by the plan commission pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 66.405-66.425. The community development authority will be authorized to undertake projects relating to blight elimination, slum clearance, urban renewal and redevelopment programs proceeding under Wis. Stats. §§ 66.405, 66.43, 66.431, 66.435 or 66.46 only as expressly authorized by a resolution of the board of trustees on a project-by-project basis. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(7), (8)) 
Sec. 26-27. - Determination of projects to pursue. 
    As guidance to the community development authority in determining what projects to undertake, it is the intent of the board of trustees that the community development authority only pursue projects that will bring or retain significant commercial and light industrial businesses (together with the stable, high quality jobs and tax base they bring) to the village. It is the intent of the board of trustees that the community development authority aid the village in competing with other potential sites for such businesses. 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(9)) 
Sec. 26-28. - Funding. 
    The community development authority shall have no separate source of funding except for funds allocated on a case-by-case basis by the board of trustees or monies received from borrowings or bond issuance by the community development authority, after approval by the board of trustees on a case-by-case basis. Whenever the community development authority desires to undertake a project, it is instructed to submit a proposal to the board of trustees for the allocation of funds to investigate the proposal, receive the approval or disapproval of the board of trustees, and implement the proposal (if approved by the board of trustees). 
(Code 1991, § 1.24(10)) 
Sec. 26-29. - Amendment of article provisions. 
    At any time, the board of trustees may, by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the board, amend this article so as to alter or abolish the duties, authority or existence of the community development authority; provided, however, that the board of trustees first make legally sufficient alternatives available for the satisfaction of any contractual obligations previously incurred by the community development authority.

Sec. 42-4. - Powers and duties of the architectural board. 
(a)  Regulations of construction, reconstruction, alteration and demolition. 
(1)  No owner or person or entity in charge of a historic structure, historic site or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property unless a building and/or occupancy permit has been granted by the village architectural board. Also, unless such permit has been granted by the village architectural board, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(2)  Upon filing of any application for a building and/or occupancy permit with the village architectural board, it shall approve the application unless: 
a.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would substantially detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which such work is to be done; 
b.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district; 
c.  In the case of any property located in a historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for such district; 
d.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the public. 
(3)  The filing of an application for a building and/or occupancy permit and any proposed historic preservation treatments on designated historic properties shall also be subject to the following historic preservation standards: 
a.  Every reasonable effort should be made to use a structure or site for its originally intended purpose, or to provide a compatible use(s) that requires minimal alteration of the site, or structure and its environment. 
b.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic materials or distinctive architectural features should be avoided whenever possible. 
c.  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. This should be considered before alterations are undertaken which have no historical basis and which seek to create an antique appearance. 
d.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. If these changes have acquired significance in their own right, their significance should be recognized and respected. 
e.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
f.  Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material shall match that being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
g.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage historic building materials shall not be used. 
h.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any acquisition, protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction project. 
i.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions will not be discouraged when such changes do not destroy significant historical features and are compatible with scale, mass and architectural features of the historic property and its environment. 
j.  New additions shall be designed so that if removed, the integrity of the structure is not impaired. 
(4)  If the village architectural board determines that the application for a building and/or occupancy permit and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the building and/or occupancy permit . The village architectural board shall make this decision within 45 days of the filing of the application. 
(5)  The issuance of a building and/or occupancy permit shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining any other applicable permits and approvals required by the village. Any other municipal permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the building and/or occupancy permit required for the proposed work. 
(6)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a building and/or occupancy permit, provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance, and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site. 
(b)  Appeals. Should the village architectural board fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the board of trustees within 30 days. Such appeal must be in writing and filed with the village clerk. The decision of the board of trustees may be appealed by the property owner to the board of zoning appeals pursuant to division 5, article II, chapter 46 of this Code. In addition, if the village architectural board fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the village architectural board shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter. 
(c)  Recognition of historic structures, sites and districts. At such time as a historic structure, site or district has been properly designated, the village architectural board may allow to be prepared and erected on such property at the property owner's expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic structure, site or district.

(d)  No building permit shall be issued for a lot which abuts a public street dedicated to only a portion of its proposed width and located on that side thereof from which the required dedication has not been secured. 
(e)  Lots abutting more restrictive district boundaries shall provide side and rear yards not less than those required in the more restrictive abutting district. The setbacks on the less restrictive district shall be modified for a distance of not more than 60 feet from the district boundary line so as to equal the average of the street yards required in both districts. 
(f)  A buffer yard may be required to be created and maintained around all business and industrial districts which abut a residential, park or institutional district and any multi-family residential district that abuts a single-family residential, two-family residential, business or industrial district. Buffer yards shall screen such uses from adjoining lands in such a manner that: 
(1)  If a buffer yard is composed mostly of plants, the plants shall be of sufficient depth, height, and varieties as to provide dense visual screening within three years and during all seasons of the year. Existing healthy plants of desirable species may be used to meet the screening requirement. 
(2)  Where architectural walls or fences are used, sufficient landscaping shall be used in conjunction with such wall or fence, except those in the B-3 district, to create an attractive view from the adjacent property. Any wall or fence shall comply with the requirements set forth for fences in subsection 46-11(8). 
(3)  Buffer yards shall be used only for landscaping, screening, drainage facilities, utilities, fences, walls and earth berms. Required buffer yards may be located within required setbacks; however, structures, other than those mentioned above, and parking spaces are not allowed in a landscaped buffer yard. 
(4)  Where a buffer yard is located next to a parking lot on the same site, the buffer screen shall be sufficiently opaque to prevent the penetration of headlight glare. Overhead lighting installed in or adjacent to a buffer yard shall not direct any rays onto adjacent properties. 
(5)  All landscaping shall be maintained by the owner or operator to the satisfaction of the village. 
(6)  No signs shall be permitted on or in any part of the buffer yard without approval of the plan commission. 
(7)  All buffer yards shall comply with the traffic visibility requirements set forth in section 46-921. 
Sec. 46-16. - Shoreland regulations. 
    In addition to any other applicable use, site, or sanitary restrictions and regulations, any use on land annexed after May 7, 1982, which lies within shorelands, as defined in section 46-1 of this chapter, shall comply with the shoreland provisions of the Waukesha County Shoreland and Floodland Protection Ordinance including minimum lot area and width requirements; minimum building setback requirements from shorelines (ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters); limitations on the type of accessory structures allowed within shorelands; limitations on clearing vegetation within shorelands; and restrictions on extensive filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching, and excavating in shorelands. Said regulations shall be administered and enforced by the village. 
Sec. 46-17. - Reduction or joint use. 
    No lot, yard, parking area, building area, or other space shall be reduced in area or dimensions so as not to meet the provisions of this chapter. No part of any lot, yard, parking area, or other space required for structure or use shall be used for any other structure or use. 
Sec. 46-18. - Nonconforming uses, structures and lots. 
(a)  Existing nonconforming uses and structures. The lawful nonconforming use of a structure, land or water existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued although the use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter; however: 
(1)  Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued and the nonconforming use may not be extended, enlarged, substituted or moved, except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Total lifetime structural repairs or alterations to a nonconforming structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the municipality's equalized assessed value of the structure at the time it became a nonconforming structure unless section 46-18(b) applies or it is permanently changed to conform to the provisions of this chapter. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications or additions. Some examples of ordinary maintenance repairs include painting, calking and decorating; and the repair or replacement of doors, windows, utilities, and sewage and water supply systems. 
(3)  Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the board of appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use or structure with the neighboring uses. 
(b)  Abolishment or replacement. If such nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 months, any future use of the structure, land or water, shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. When a nonconforming use or a structure with a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, the public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than 50 percent of its equalized assessed value, it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this chapter. Existing nonconforming structures with a conforming use which are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood or other calamity shall, when reconstructed, conform to the established setback lines along streets and the yard, height, parking, loading, and access provisions of this chapter. If a nonconforming structure with a conforming use was damaged or destroyed after March 1, 2006, by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold or infestation, such structure may be restored to the size, location, and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred in accordance with Wis. Stats. §§ 61.351(5m) and 62.23(7)(hc). In addition, no limits may be imposed on the costs of the repair, reconstruction or improvement of said structure. A file of all nonconforming uses and structures shall be maintained by the building inspector listing the following: owner's name and address; use of the structure, land or water; and assessed value at the time of it becoming a nonconforming use or structure. 
(c)  Existing nonconforming structures. The lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued although its size or location does not conform with the lot width, lot area, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions of this chapter. However, it shall not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Floodplain nonconforming uses and structures. Floodplain nonconforming uses and structures that are to be repaired or altered shall comply with division 5 of article X of this chapter. 
(e)  Wetland nonconforming uses. Notwithstanding Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(h) and (hc), the repair, reconstruction, renovating, remodeling or expansion of a legal nonconforming structure, or any environmental control facility related to a legal nonconforming structure, located in the C-1 lowland conservancy district and in existence at the time of adoption or subsequent amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived is permitted pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 61.351(5) and (5m). 
(f)  Changes and substitutions. Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use or a substandard structure has been changed to conform, it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or structure. Once the board of zoning appeals has permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use, the substituted use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and become subject to all the conditions required by the zoning board of appeals. 
(g)  Nonconforming characteristics of residential structures. Residential structures which encroach upon the yard requirements of this chapter, but which met yard requirements at the time of construction, may be structurally altered, provided that they do not create a greater degree of encroachment. 
(h)  Existing nonconforming (substandard) lots. See section 46-926(g).

Such certification shall include the first floor elevation of any structure erected on the site. 
(h)  Preexisting uses. Principal or accessory uses listed in an occupancy permit issued prior to September 1, 1995, do not require the issuance of a new occupancy permit until such time as a new, different or additional principal or accessory use occurs on the property or if there is a new owner or tenant of nonresidential property. As a condition of issuing an occupancy permit for a principal or accessory use existing prior to September 1, 1995, the building inspector may require evidence satisfactory to the building inspector that such principal or accessory use was actively occurring on the property between September 1, 1994, and September 1, 1995. The occupancy permit issued for principal or accessory uses occurring prior to September 1, 1995, will be only for the scope, intensity and size of the principal or accessory uses as they occurred between September 1, 1994 and September 1, 1995. Expansion, intensification or change of the principal or accessory use will require a subsequent occupancy permit and will be subject to all zoning restrictions as then applicable to the zoning district applicable to that property. 
(i)  After an occupancy permit application has been received and an occupancy inspection has been completed by the building inspection department an occupancy letter will be sent to the applicant listing all violations. An occupancy permit will be issued when all violations have been corrected.

(2)  If the conditional occupancy permit is issued the applicant agrees to have all violations corrected with 45 days. A reinspection will be scheduled after 45 days to check for compliance. If any violations exist a penalty of $25.00 per day will be assessed until all violations are corrected. 
(3)  Fee for business occupancy permit shall be included in Appendix A of this Code under Fees and Charges, Chapter 18, Occupancy Permit.

The fees for petitions and permit applications shall be set by resolution of the village board. 
(b)  If the village administrator, village board or plan commission determine that additional professional assistance is needed, beyond what is normally necessary to review a proposed development, petition or permit application, the village administrator or village board may employ the services of engineers, planners, architects or related professional experts as may be required, the services of which shall be paid for by the developer, petitioner or applicant. A deposit of funds may be required prior to any meeting. 
(c)  The village administrator may require one or more staff meetings to review any proposed plan or development prior to its consideration by the plan commission. 
Sec. 46-82. - Double fee. 
    A double fee shall be charged by the building inspector if work is started before a permit is applied for and issued, or if a building or the premises are occupied prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. Such double fee shall not release the applicant from full compliance with this chapter nor from prosecution for violation of this chapter. 
Sec. 46-83. - Violations, remedial action and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. Any building or structure erected, moved, placed or structurally altered, or any use established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived in violation of the provisions of this chapter by any person (including building contractors or his or their agent), shall be deemed an unlawful structure or use.

(c)  Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, neglects, omits or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation, rule or order made hereunder shall be subject to a penalty as provided in section 1-4 of the Village of Hartland Municipal Code.

(Ord. No. 836-15, § 1, 9-28-2015) 
Sec. 46-100. - Principles. 
    To implement and define criteria for the purposes set forth in section 46-96, the following principles are established: 
(1)  No building or sign shall be permitted the design or exterior appearance of which is of such unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to its surroundings as to be unsightly or offensive to generally accepted taste and community standards. 
(2)  No building or sign shall be permitted the design or exterior appearance of which is so similar with those within reasonable proximity as to create excessive monotony or drabness. 
(3)  No building or sign shall be permitted where any exposed façade is constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically incompatible with the other façades and which presents an unattractive appearance to the public and to surrounding properties. 
(4)  No building or sign shall be permitted to be sited on the property in a manner which would unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the natural beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in that area; or which would unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the beauty and general enjoyment of existing structures on adjoining properties. 
(5)  Development and redevelopment shall be consistent with the public goals, objectives, principles, standards, policies and design guidelines set forth in the adopted village comprehensive plan or components thereof, including the Village of Hartland Master Plan and the Hartland Village Center Revitalization Plan. 
Sec. 46-101. - Guidelines. 
    The following design guidelines are established for all development applications for commercial, industrial, institutional and multifamily uses: 
(1)  Building design. 
a.  Architectural style is not restricted; however, structures shall be consistent or compatible with the surrounding area. Compatibility may be achieved through the use of various visual architectural elements such as similar rooflines, building orientations, forms/shapes, proportions (scale and mass), door and window patterns (fenestration), textures, materials, colors and other architectural detailing. Building lighting, signage and mechanical equipment also shall be presented as an integral part of the building design and shall not detract from the architectural style of the building. 
b.  The composition of major building elements such as massing, rooflines, colors and material shall complement and contribute to a desirable community identity. 
c.  Colors shall be harmonious and relate to the overall site and to the village as a whole. Bright complementary colors may be used for highlighting purposes (accenting) provided such colors do not overbear the integrity of the building façade. 
d.  Rooftop mechanical equipment, trash/dumpster areas, and other utility hardware located on the site shall be screened from public view with building and landscape material or be located in a manner that is unobtrusive. 
e.  No rows of garage doors for multifamily uses and no overhead service doors or loading docks shall face a public street. The plan commission may allow such features to face a public street when it finds that there is no feasible alternative orientation for such doors or docks and, insofar as is practicable, such doors and docks facing public streets are to be screened with landscaping and/or softened by architectural detailing. 
f.  Accessory buildings and structures shall be compatible with the principal building in terms of building façade character, roof shapes, materials, colors and architectural details. 
(2)  Exterior building materials. 
a.  Materials shall be consistent or compatible with the architectural character of the village and shall be consistent with the surrounding area. Where the proposed materials are dissimilar to prevailing materials used on existing buildings in the area, other characteristics such as form, proportion, texture, color and detailing shall be utilized to ensure that adequate similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the use of different materials. 
b.  Materials shall be of durable quality. 
c.  The façades of buildings shall be finished with an aesthetically pleasing material(s) such as natural or cultured stone, brick, wood, glass panels, or ornate masonry materials, except where the building style requires a different material. No plain concrete-block or plain concrete-panel buildings or smooth or corrugated metal-faced buildings that are devoid of an architectural merit or character, except those with an attractive finished surface listed above, may be allowed. 
Building façades clad with a single exterior surface material shall provide some additional architectural design elements to break up the plane of large faceless and/or nondescript walls. This may be achieved by architectural design treatments consistent with the principal building design. 
(3)  Lighting standards. Lighting on individual building sites shall adhere to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and sections 46-949 and 46-955, as well as the following requirements: 
a.  All exterior parking areas must be illuminated. 
b.  Illuminating curb cuts and entrances to parking areas is encouraged. 
c.  All exterior lighting shall be energy efficient and shall be located, oriented and of an intensity to illuminate only the building site or lot, where located, without detrimentally affecting activity on adjacent sites or lots or traffic on streets and highways. 
d.  Lighting shall not be located on the roofs of buildings. Any lights affixed to a building shall be oriented downward at an angle from the vertical so as to light only areas of the site. 
e.  Lights may not flash, pulsate, be so bright as to impair or hinder vision on public streets or adjacent building sites, or otherwise constitute a nuisance. 
f.  Mixing of lighting types (i.e. sodium vapor, incandescent, mercury vapor and metal halide) shall be avoided. 
g.  Integration of similar lighting fixtures is encouraged. 
h.  Exterior lighting shall not shine on or adversely impact neighboring properties or streets. 
i.  Exterior lighting components such as fixtures, standards and exposed accessories should be consistent with the overall site design. 
j.  The height of exterior lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the scale of adjacent buildings. 
(4)  Landscaping. 
a.  Landscape design shall be integrated with the overall site plan and not be considered merely as an afterthought. Interesting or creative landscape architectural designs that use a diverse variety of plants integrated with other landscaping materials or features should be provided to avoid uncreative and monotonous landscaping. 
b.  Landscape plans shall be well-planned and effective in the following areas: along street frontages, within and around paved parking areas and within buffer yards as screening for adjoining properties. 
c.  Terrace/street trees shall be planted to provide a street frontage buffer. 
d.  Paved parking areas shall be landscaped in order to minimize the impact of large expanses of pavement. Large paved areas shall include well-designed landscape islands. Planter islands shall contain trees and shrubs. Parking areas shall also be screened along the periphery to soften the impact for adjoining properties. 
e.  Landscaping shall be used to screen loading areas, dumpsters and mechanical equipment from public view; or they shall be located so as not to be visible from public ways. If landscaping materials are used, they shall form an immediate, solid and continuous screen. Solid fencing with landscaping as an accent may be necessary to totally screen loading areas, trash dumpster areas or mechanical equipment from view. 
f.  Trees and shrubs shall not create blind spots along traffic ways for pedestrians or vehicular traffic. 
(5)  Signage. Outdoor signs for developments shall adhere to the provisions of subsection (5) of this section and article VII of this chapter, as well as the following requirements: 
a.  Signs shall be consistent or compatible with the architectural character of the principal building and/or the surrounding area. 
b.  Every sign shall be considered within its setting and designed according to the scale and proportions in which it will be viewed. 
c.  The mass of an awning used as a sign shall not dominate the façade of the building to which it is attached. 
d.  Freestanding signs shall be appropriately landscaped, whenever possible. 
Sec. 46-102. - Applications for review. 
    Applications for review by the architectural board shall be made to the building inspector and shall be accompanied by plans showing the exterior elevations of the existing and proposed structure, description of the proposed materials and a site plan. For commercial, industrial, institutional and multifamily uses, a site plan, HVAC locations, landscaping plan, and plans for signing and lighting are also required. 
Sec. 46-103. - Findings and modifications. 
    The architectural board shall not approve any application unless it finds that the purposes set forth in sections 42-1, 46-96, 46-100 and the guidelines in section 46-101 have been reasonably met. In certain situations, the architectural board may allow modifications or grant exceptions to the building height in accordance with section 46-925(a) and to the guidelines set forth in section 46-101 on the basis of compelling architectural merit, or where the strict application or adherence to established guidelines may be impractical or impossible due to site conditions or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
Sec. 46-104. - Decision. 
    The architectural board shall hear and decide all applications at the final meeting for the application. The findings of the architectural board shall be indicated in the minutes of its proceedings and shall be a public record. 
Sec. 46-105. - Appeals. 
    Any person aggrieved by any decisions of the architectural board may appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals, in accordance with division 5 of this article. Such appeal shall be filed with the clerk within 30 days after filing of the decision with the clerk.

These records shall be immediately filed in the office of the board of zoning appeals, and shall be a public record. 
(d)  Quorum. The presence of four members of the board shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum is present, a majority vote shall be necessary to correct an error; grant a variance; make an interpretation; and permit a temporary, unclassified, substituted use. If there are less than four members present, the matter must be tabled. 
Sec. 46-124. - Powers. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers, including those specified in section 46-1088(1): 
(1)  Errors. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the plan commission. 
(2)  Variances. To hear and authorize appeals for variances where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement will result in practical difficulty or undue hardship. Such variance shall not be contrary to the public interest and shall be so conditioned that the spirit and purposes of this chapter shall be observed and the public safety, welfare and justice secured. 
(3)  Interpretations. To hear and decide applications for interpretations of the zoning regulations and the location of the boundaries of the zoning districts and floodplains, after the plan commission has made a review and recommendation. Floodplain boundaries shall be altered by the board of zoning appeals only when the applicant presents evidence that clearly and conclusively establishes that the location as shown on the zoning map is incorrect. 
(4)  Substitutions. To hear and grant applications for substitution of more restrictive nonconforming uses for existing nonconforming uses provided no structural alterations are to be made and the plan commission has made a review and recommendation. Whenever the board of zoning appeals permits such a substitution, the use may not thereafter be changed without application. 
(5)  Permits. The board of zoning appeals may reverse, affirm (wholly or partly) or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made.

(7)  Oaths. The chairman may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
Sec. 46-125. - Appeals and applications. 
    Appeals to the board of zoning appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the village affected by the decision of the plan commission or village board. Such appeals shall be filed with the clerk within 90 days after the date of written notice of the decision or order of the plan commission. Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected at any time and shall be filed with the clerk. Such appeals and application shall include the following: 
(1)  Name and address of the appellant or applicant and all abutting and opposite property owners of record. 
(2)  Plat of survey prepared by a land surveyor registered in the state or other map drawn to scale, showing all of the information required under chapter 18 of this Code for a building permit.

(1)  Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in which the development is located. No variance shall have the effect of permitting a use in any district that is not a stated permitted use, accessory use or conditional use in that particular district. 
(2)  Exceptional circumstances. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district, and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter shall be changed. 
(3)  Economic hardship and self-imposed hardship not grounds for variance. No variance shall be granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the granting of a variance. 
(4)  Preservation of property rights. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity. 
(5)  Absence of detriment. The variance will not create substantial detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest. 
(6)  Additional requirements in floodplain districts. See section 46-1088(4) of this chapter. 
Sec. 46-128. - Mapping disputes. 
    The following procedures shall be used by the board of zoning appeals in settling disputes of conservancy district or floodplain district and shoreland boundaries: 
(1)  Conservancy district disputes. Whenever the board of appeals is asked to interpret a C-1 lowland conservancy district boundary where an apparent discrepancy exists between the village's final wetland inventory map and actual field conditions, the village shall contact the state department of natural resources (DNR), or other appropriate authority, to determine if the wetland inventory map is in error. If the DNR staff, or the staff or another appropriate authority, concurs that the particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the board of zoning appeals shall direct the plan commission to initiate appropriate action to rezone the property within a reasonable amount of time. 
(2)  Floodplain disputes. See sections 46-1088(3) and 46-1089 of this chapter.

Whenever the board of zoning appeals is asked to interpret the location of a shoreland boundary, the building inspector shall contact the appropriate regional office of the state department of natural resources (DNR) for determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark (OHWM) location. 
Sec. 46-129. - Decision. 
(a)  The board of zoning appeals shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days after the public hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the board of zoning appeal's decision to the appellant or applicant, zoning administrator and the plan commission.

Sec. 46-130. - Notice to DNR. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall transmit a copy of each application for a variance to conservancy regulations in the shoreland portion of the C-1 conservancy district or to the floodplain regulations in a FWO or FFO floodplain district, and a copy of all shoreland C-1 and floodplain appeals, to the state department of natural resources (DNR) for review and comment at least ten days prior to any public hearings. Final action on the application shall not be taken for 30 days or until the DNR has made its recommendation, whichever comes first. A copy of all decisions relating to variances to shoreland conservancy regulations or to floodplain regulations, and a copy of all decisions to shoreland conservancy and floodplain appeals, shall be transmitted to the DNR within ten days of the date of such decision. 
Sec. 46-131. - Review by court of record. 
    Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning appeals may present to the court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality.

DIVISION 29. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 46-801. - Intent. 
    The PUD planned unit development overlay district is intended to allow, as a conditional use, development that will, over a period of time, be enhanced by coordinated area site planning, diversified location of structures, diversified building types, and/or mixing of compatible uses, including mixed uses in traditional neighborhood development. Such developments are intended to provide a safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicle traffic; to provide attractive recreation and open spaces as integral parts of the developments; to enable economic design in the location of public and private utilities and community facilities; and to ensure adequate standards of construction and planning. The PUD overlay district under this chapter will allow for flexibility of overall development design with benefits from such design flexibility intended to be derived by both the developer and the community, while at the same time maintaining, insofar as possible, the land use density and other standards or use requirements as set forth in the underlying basic zoning district. 
    Projects within PUD's which are granted the benefit of flexibility in the application of standard land use regulations, including design considerations, shall be determined by the plan commission to include unique or distinct site development features which would enhance the project in ways that would not be realized when applying standard land use regulations for site development. Such features may include, but are not limited to: large or unique open spaces, extensive or ornate architectural or landscape features, underground parking and/or environmentally sustainable technologies and building materials. However, the plan commission shall not allow such design flexibility regarding density, and required lot area, width and yard requirements in the underlying basic zoning district for the sole purpose of increasing development intensity. 
    The unified and planned development of a site in a single, partnership or corporate ownership or control or in common ownership under the Unit Ownership Act set forth in Wis. Stats. Ch. 703, condominiums may be permitted by the village upon specific petition under this division and after public hearing, with such development encompassing one or more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses or structures when all regulations and standards as set forth in this division have been met. Individual lots or buildings may be subsequently conveyed to separate ownerships as indicated on an approved plan. The location of all uses allowed within a PUD shall be in accordance with the duly approved development plan for the PUD. 
Sec. 46-802. - Permitted uses. 
    All uses shall be conditional upon the determination as to their appropriateness within the context of the village's comprehensive plan or components thereof, their conformance with the provisions of the PUD overlay district, and subject to such conditions as may be established as part of final plan approval. 
(1)  Any use allowed as either a permitted or conditional use in an underlying basic or overlay zoning district may be allowed as a conditional use in a planned unit development. Individual structures shall comply with the minimum building floor area and maximum height requirements, unless section 46-926(a) applies, of the underlying basic zoning district as applicable to the uses within the structures. All open space and parking requirements of the underlying basic zoning district shall be complied with either individually or by providing the combined open space and parking space required for the entire development in one or more locations within the development, unless section 46-923(13) applies. 
(2)  Where the underlying zoning is a RD-1 or RD-2 district, then two-family residential uses mixed with compatible single-family residential uses may be allowed in a planned unit development. Any accessory uses such as a swimming pool, recreational area, pavilion or similar use designed as an accessory amenity or service to the planned unit development may be allowed. 
(3)  Where the underlying zoning is a RM-1, RM-2 or RM-3 district, then multi-family residential uses mixed with compatible two- and/or single-family residential uses may be allowed in a planned unit development. Any accessory uses such as a swimming pool, recreational area, pavilion or similar use designed as an accessory amenity or service to the planned unit development may be allowed. 
(4)  If residential uses are proposed, the percentage mix of dwelling unit types required in a planned unit development shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the plan commission. 
Sec. 46-803. - Minimum area requirements. 
    All permitted uses and the minimum area requirements for the development will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the plan commission. 
Sec. 46-804. - Density requirements (lot area, width and yard requirements). (See also section 46-926.) 
    In the PUD district the lot area, width and yard requirements of the underlying basic use district may be modified. However, where the underlying zoning is a residential basic use district, the average density may only be increased a maximum of ten percent over the average density permitted in the underlying basic use district and only after the plan commission has determined that the proposed planned unit development satisfies the review criteria set forth in this division. 
Sec. 46-805. - Building height and area. (See also section 46-926.) 
    Buildings in a planned unit development overlay district shall:

ARTICLE V. - SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 

Sec. 46-921. - Traffic visibility. 
    No substantial obstructions, such as structures, parking or vegetation, shall be permitted in any district between the heights of two and one-half feet and ten feet above the plane through the mean curb grades adjacent to the triangular space formed by any two existing or proposed intersecting street or alley right-of-way lines and a line joining points on such lines located a minimum of 15 feet from their intersection. In the case of arterial streets intersecting with other arterial streets or railways, the corner cutoff distances establishing the triangular vision clearance space shall be increased to 50 feet. These restrictions may be modified in the B-3 district on a case-by-case basis, when, in the opinion of the plan commission, such modifications would further the objectives of the district. Necessary utility poles and traffic, directional and street name signs approved by the public agency having jurisdiction may be permitted within such triangular areas. Vision triangles at intersections with state and county trunk highways shall meet the vision corner requirements of the state or county highway agency that has jurisdiction, but in no case shall they be less than those specified herein.

Sec. 46-923. - Parking requirements. 
    In all districts and in connection with every use there shall be provided at the time any use or building is erected, enlarged, extended or increased off-street parking stalls for all vehicles in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Adequate access to a public street shall be provided for each parking space, and driveways shall be at least ten feet wide for one-family and two-family dwellings, at least 18 feet for farmsteads and a 24-foot driveway for all other uses. Driveway openings for vehicular ingress and egress from streets shall meet the requirements of section 46-924(2). 
The exception being that a 16-foot driveway will be permitted in the B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and B-5 business zoning districts if the drive is properly identified for one-way traffic only. 
(2)  The size of each parking space shall be at least 180 square feet exclusive of the space required for access drives, sometimes called traffic aisles, and except for space provided for use by persons with disabilities. 
Parking spaces shall open directly onto a traffic aisle that is wide enough to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking spaces. Two-way traffic aisles shall be at least 24 feet wide, and one-way traffic aisles at least 16 feet wide. 
(3)  Parking spaces for use by physically disabled persons shall be provided in accordance with Wis. Stats. §§ 346.50, 346.503 and 346.505 and any amendments thereto. 
(4)  Curbs or barriers shall be installed a minimum of four feet from a property line so as to prevent the parked vehicles from extending over any lot lines; and a minimum three feet from fences, walls, shrubs, trees, or other plants and structures so as to prevent damage to the structure or landscaping. 
(5)  Location to be on the same lot as the principal use, unless the provisions of section 46-923(13)a. or b. applies. 
(6)  All off-street parking areas shall be graded and surfaced with bituminous asphalt or concrete and be properly drained. All parking areas for five or more vehicles shall have the aisles and spaces clearly marked. 
(7)  Lighting for parking lots shall meet the requirements of section 46-955. 
(8)  All public and private off-street parking areas which serve five or more vehicles and are created or redesigned and rebuilt subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be provided with accessory landscape areas totaling not less than five percent of the surfaced area. The minimum size of each landscape area shall not be less than 100 square feet. At the end of each parking bay, or row of spaces, a landscaped island of a similar dimension as a parking space shall be provided to separate the bay or row from driveways or traffic access aisles. The dimensions of a landscaped island may vary from the parking space dimension to allow desirable geometric design features, such as rounded corners and angles, to facilitate maneuvering of automobile traffic. Trees shall be provided at the rate of one deciduous tree at least two inches in caliper measured 4.5 feet above ground for every 20 parking spaces and shall be provided in the landscaped areas required within the interior of the parking lot. Location of landscape areas, plant materials, protection afforded the plantings, including curbing and provision for maintenance, shall be subject to approval by the plan commission and may be modified in accordance with section 46-923(13)a. All plans for such proposed parking areas shall include a topographic survey or grading plan which shows existing and proposed grades and location of improvements. The preservation of existing trees, shrubs and other natural vegetation in the parking area may be included in the calculation of the required minimum landscape area. 
(9)  Screening. 
a.  All parking lots, except in the A-1 district and the single- and two-family residential zoning districts, and loading/unloading service areas adjoining public rights-of-way or a residential district shall be screened from such areas by a solid wall, solid fence, raised berm, densely planted evergreen plants, or other effective means as determined acceptable by the plan commission. Where walls or fences are used, sufficient landscaping shall be provided in conjunction with such wall or fence to create an attractive view from the street or residential side. 
The screening between a parking lot and a street or public right-of-way shall attain a height of at least three feet measured above the parking surface within three years, with a minimum height of 18 inches at the time of installation, and may consist of a combination of landscaping materials including fencing, walls, berms or plantings on top of berms or in planters. The screening between a parking lot and an adjoining residential district shall be a minimum of six feet in height, and between a loading/unloading service area and an adjoining residential district shall be a minimum of ten feet in height, at the time of installation. The plan commission may waive or reduce the screening requirement due to grade differences between adjoining properties, and may require greater screening requirements for parking of large trucks, semitrailers, large equipment, and for screening overhead service doors, and truck loading areas and docks. 
b.  All fencing shall be placed on the property or properties being screened and shall not project into a public right-of-way, shall not obstruct the vision clearance triangle, and shall not extend over side or rear property lines. Fences with landscaping shall be located away from property lines so that plant growth will not extend beyond property lines.

(12)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section (10), structures in the B-3 central business/mixed-use district having not more than two non-senior dwelling units shall not be required to provide attached garage parking. 
(13)  Modification of parking and loading requirements. 
a.  Modifications. The village plan commission may increase or decrease the loading/unloading and parking requirements set forth in sections 46-922 and 46-923, respectively, of this chapter when it is determined that the use will need more or fewer spaces because of the intensity of use; employees working off-site; cooperative/shared parking arrangements with different peak parking demands; use of alternative transportation such as public transit, van pool operations, car-pooling, and bicycles; or other evidence that indicates the demand for parking or loading/unloading spaces will be more or less than chapter requirements. The plan commission may also adjust the landscaping and dimension requirements for parking or loading/loading spaces due to significant site constraints, parking lots with parallel parking spaces or one-way traffic aisles, designated spaces for compact cars, or common access aisles shared between parking spaces for the disabled. 
The petitioner shall submit written documentation and data to the satisfaction of the plan commission when the operation will require fewer parking or loading/unloading spaces than the chapter requirements. Information shall be submitted such as documents, contracts, covenants, joint lease agreements, purchase agreements, deed restrictions, or other agreements, which shall be recorded by the applicant with the register of deeds, as may be deemed necessary by the plan commission to ensure that the required spaces are provided and maintained during the life of the development. 
b.  Payment-in-lieu of providing off-street parking for nonresidential uses only in the B-3 district. Nonresidential uses and buildings erected, enlarged, extended or increased in a B-3 district may, upon documentation satisfactory to the plan commission and village board, meet some or all of its parking requirements by using public parking available within 400 feet of the use or building. A use which uses this provision shall, upon approval by the village board, make a one-time payment to the Village of Hartland equal to the documented cost of constructing, as well as maintaining, the required parking as if it were placed on vacant, undeveloped land accessible to a public street. The cost shall be established by the Village of Hartland based upon a current estimate. The fee shall be an amount equal to the current fair market value of the waived parking space, the area of which shall be determined by the number of required spaces times 300 square feet, and the cost of converting and maintaining such land as a parking area as estimated by the village public works director. This would be a condition of plan approval and would run with the use as long as it remained on site and was not expanded or changed. Any change of use or expansion of buildings in the future is subject to subsections c. and d. below. No refund of such payment shall be made when there is a change to a use requiring less parking. 
c.  Changes in occupancy or use. When the use of a building, structure, or land is changed to another use or occupant that requires more parking or loading/unloading spaces than required for the use existing immediately prior to such change, additional parking or loading/unloading spaces shall be constructed or comply with subsection b. above for the new use or occupant in the amount necessary to conform to this chapter. 
d.  Changes in intensity of use. When the intensity of an existing use of a building, structure, or land is increased by an addition of employees, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement, additional parking or loading/unloading spaces shall be constructed or comply with subsection b. above for such additions in the amount necessary to conform to this chapter. 
Cross reference- Traffic and vehicles, ch. 82. 
Sec. 46-924. - Driveways. 
    All driveways installed, altered, changed, replaced, or extended after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Islands. Islands between driveway openings shall be provided with a minimum of six feet between all driveways and three feet at all lot lines, except that the plan commission is allowed to recommend approval of joint or shared driveways for all nonresidential zoning districts to the village board, based upon its determination that a joint or shared driveway is the best alternative due to site plan and immediate area considerations. The plan commission and village board may condition their recommendations and approval of joint or shared driveways upon the execution and recording of an agreement among all affected property owners establishing: 
a.  Obligations to improve and maintain and pay for improvements and maintenance of shared driveway. 
b.  Permanent ingress/egress easements. 
c.  Whether and to what extent parking will be allowed on the shared portion of the driveway.

(2)  Openings. Driveway openings for vehicular ingress and egress shall not exceed 20 feet at the street right-of-way line and 26 feet at the curb line in single- and two-family residential districts; and shall not exceed 25 feet at the street right-of-way line and 32 feet at the curb line in all other districts. A wider opening may be approved by the plan commission, after a recommendation by the village engineer, to prevent a traffic hazard. 
Sec. 46-925. - Highway access. 
    No direct private access shall be permitted to the existing or proposed rights-of-way of expressways, nor to any controlled access arterial street without permission of the highway agency that has access control jurisdiction. No direct public or private access shall be permitted to the existing or proposed rights-of-way of the following: 
(1)  Freeways, interstate highways, and their interchanges or turning lanes nor to intersecting or interchanging streets within 1,500 feet of the most remote end of the taper of the turning lanes. 
(2)  Arterial streets intersecting another arterial street within 100 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines. 
(3)  Access barriers, such as curbing, fencing, ditching, landscaping or other topographic barriers, shall be erected to prevent unauthorized vehicular ingress or egress to the above specified streets or highways. 
(4)  Temporary access to the above rights-of-way may be granted by the village board after review and recommendation by the highway agencies having jurisdiction. Such access permit shall be temporary, revocable and subject to any conditions required and shall be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months. 
Sec. 46-926. - Modifications. 
(a)  Height. The district height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this chapter may be exceeded, but such modification shall be in accord with the following: 
(1)  An increase in building height may be granted by the village board, after a recommendation by the plan commission, for principal and accessory buildings when, in the opinion of the village board and plan commission, the increase is intended to accommodate an attractive roof or façade design that is also compatible with the general character of the neighborhood and is not detrimental to adjacent properties. However, an increase in building height for the express purpose of adding another livable or useable floor level, than would typically be realized under the standard height requirement of the basic zoning district, is prohibited except where subsection (a)(8) herein applies. 
(2)  Architectural projections. Spires, steeples, belfries, parapet walls, cupolas, domes, flues, chimneys, etc., are exempt from the height limitations of this chapter. 
(3)  Special structures. Elevator penthouses, gas tanks, grain elevators, observation towers, scenery lofts, manufacturing equipment and necessary mechanical appurtenances, cooling towers, fire towers, substations, smokestacks, etc., are exempt from the height limitations of this chapter.

(5)  Communication structures. Radio and television transmission and relay towers, aerials, radio and television receiving and transmitting antennas, not including ground-mounted and building-mounted earth station dish antennas, shall not exceed a height three times their distance from the nearest lot line. Ground-mounted earth station dish antennas shall not exceed a height of 20 feet. Building-mounted earth station dish antennas shall not exceed the maximum height regulation of the district in which they are located. 
(6)  Agricultural structures. Barns, silos, windmills, etc., shall not exceed in height twice their distance from the nearest lot line. 
(7)  Public or semipublic facilities. Schools, churches, offices, stations, etc. may be erected to a height of 45 feet, provided that all required yards are increased not less than one foot for each foot the structure exceeds the district's maximum height requirement. 
(8)  Planned unit developments. The plan commission may grant an exception to district height restrictions where a planned unit development has been utilized if the plan commission finds that such exception will not negatively impact the architectural character or integrity of the neighborhood. No exception shall be granted, however, if it will result in any building or structure exceeding 45 feet unless other provisions in this subsection 46-925(a) apply. If an exception is granted, the building and/or site shall contain "patterns" or architectural features as recommended in the adopted Hartland Village Center Revitalization Plan, including requiring the upper story(ies) to be "building step-backs"; the pitched-roof space with dormers (i.e. useable or livable floor area occupying the interior roof space); loggias or recessed balconies/porches; or any combination thereof to reduce the massiveness of such buildings. 
(9)  Garages. The plan commission may, following a site plan review and an affirmative recommendation of the architectural board, grant up to a three-foot exception to district height limitations for a garage that is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this chapter provided, however, that no garage shall exceed 18 feet in height. No exception may be granted under this section unless the plan commission first finds that: 
a.  The proposed structure is in harmony with existing structures on the property and in the neighborhood; and 
b.  The proposed structure is aesthetically consistent with the architectural roof features of other structures on the property and in the neighborhood. 
(b)  Yards. The yard requirements stipulated elsewhere in this chapter may be modified as follows: 
(1)  Uncovered stairs. Uncovered stairs, landings and fire escapes may project into any yard but not to exceed six feet and not closer than three feet to any lot line. 
(2)  Architectural projections. Chimneys, flues, sills, eaves, belt courses, ornaments, etc., may project into any required yard; but such projection shall not exceed three feet. 
(3)  Residential fences and hedges. Residential fences and hedges are permitted on the property lines in residential districts but shall not, in any case, exceed a height of six feet; shall not exceed a height of three feet in the street yard and shall not be closer than two feet to any public right-of-way. Required fences around swimming pools are exempt from the requirements of this subsection, provided that the requirements of subsection 46-11(6)(c) are met. 
(4)  Security fences. Security fences are permitted on the property lines in all districts but shall not exceed six feet in height in residential districts and ten feet in height in nonresidential districts. Security fences shall be of an open type similar to woven wire or wrought iron fencing. 
(5)  Accessory uses. Accessory uses and detached accessory structures are permitted in the rear yard only in residential districts, provided that they shall be no closer than ten feet to any structure with the exception of accessory structures in the RS-5 single-family residential district which shall be allowed to reduce their distance to that property's principal structure to five feet if all accessible areas within the accessory structure be constructed with one-hour fire rated construction, and no closer than five feet from side or rear lot line and any side or rear lot line, nor occupy more than the lesser of 20 percent of the rear yard area or 800 square feet. Accessory uses and detached accessory structures are permitted in the side and rear yards in business, industrial, quarrying/extractive, institutional and park districts, provided that they shall be no closer than ten feet to the principal structure, shall not occupy more than 50 percent of a side yard nor 75 percent of a rear yard area, and shall be no closer than three feet to a rear yard area, and shall be no closer than three feet to any side or rear lot line, nor five feet to any alley line. 
(6)  Off-street parking. Off-street parking is permitted in all yards of all districts except in the front yards of single-family and two-family residence districts, but shall not be closer than three feet to a side lot line right-of-way or rear lot line. 
(7)  Essential services. Utilities, electric power and communication transmission lines are exempt from the yard and distance requirements of this chapter. 
(8)  Landscaping. Landscaping and vegetation are exempt from the yard requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Additions. Additions in the street yard of existing structures shall not project beyond the average of the existing street yards on the abutting lots or parcels. 
(d)  Average street yards. The required street yards may be decreased in any residential or business districts to the average of the existing street yards of the abutting structures on each side, but in no case less than 15 feet in any residential district and five feet in any business district except in the B-3 central business/mixed use district. 
(e)  Measuring setbacks from culs-de-sac and curved streets, curved streets and access easements. The required setback on culs-de-sac and curved streets shall be determined by measuring the required setback from the arc of the street right-of-way line resulting in a setback line parallel to the arc of the street right-of-way line. The required setback for lots containing easements for private streets and pedestrian or trail access shall be determined by measuring the required setback from the edge of such easements. 
(f)  Corner lots. Structures shall provide a street yard as required by this chapter on the street that the structure faces. A second street yard shall be provided on the side of the structure abutting a second public or private street. The remaining yards shall be a side yard and a rear yard. The zoning administrator shall determine which yard is the side yard and which yard is the rear yard. The rear yard shall generally be the yard directly behind the front entrance to the structure and the side yard shall be the remaining yard. Corner lots that are also a double frontage lot, sometimes called through lots, shall provide three street yards, one on each side of the structure facing a street.. 
(g)  Existing substandard lots. 
(1)  A lot which does not contain sufficient area to conform to the dimensional requirements of this chapter, but which is at least 50 feet wide and 6,000 square feet in area, may be used as a single-family building site, provided that the use is permitted in the zoning district, and provided that the lot is of record in the county register of deeds' office prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; and provided that the lot is in separate ownership from abutting lands. 
(2)  A lot located in a nonresidential district which does not contain sufficient area to conform to the dimensional requirements of this chapter may be used as a building site provided that the use is permitted in the applicable basic use and any overlay zoning district; the lot is of record in the county register of deeds office prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; the lot is in a separate ownership from abutting lands; and that the lot contains adequate/sufficient area to accommodate the proposed use as determined by the plan commission. 
(3)  If two or more substandard lots with continuous frontage have the same ownership as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the lots involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the purpose of this chapter. 
(4)  Substandard lots granted permits under this section shall be required to meet the setback and other yard requirements of this chapter. A building permit for the improvement of a lot with lesser dimensions and requisites than those stated above shall be issued only after a variance by the board of appeals. 
(h)  Floodplain and lowland conservancy lands eligible for meeting area requirements. Where a lot is located partially within a floodplain overlay and lowland conservancy district and a minimum of 50 percent of the lot is located within any other adjoining use or zoning district, that portion of the lot in the floodplain and/or lowland conservancy district may be utilized to meet the area requirements of the adjoining use or zoning district provided sufficient area on the lot is also provided outside the floodplain or lowland conservancy area for the proposed use as determined by the plan commission. 
(i)  Compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Modifications to requirements of this chapter may be granted by the plan commission for the purpose of complying with the requirements of title II, "Public Services," and title III, "Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities," of the Americans With Disabilities Act.

    This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in Wis. Stats. § 87.30. 
(Ord. No. 817-14, § 1, 2-10-2014) 
Sec. 46-1068. - Finding of fact. 
    Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this village would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(Ord. No. 817-14, § 1, 2-10-2014) 
Sec. 46-1069. - Statement of purpose. 
    This article is intended to regulate floodplain development to:

(b)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(d)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(f)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(g)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(h)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(i)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 817-14, § 1, 2-10-2014) 
Sec. 46-1070. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village of Hartland, Wisconsin. 
(Ord. No. 817-14, § 1, 2-10-2014) 
Sec. 46-1071. - General provisions. 
(a)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(b)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see Division 8 Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the Office of the Village Clerk, Village of Hartland. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0064H, 55133C0068H, 55133C0176H, 55133C0177H, 55133C0178H, 55133C0179H, and 55133C0181G, dated November 5, 2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Waukesha County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated November 5, 2014, Volumes 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C, 55133CV003C. 
(c)  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
(1)  The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(2)  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
(3)  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO Zones on the FIRM. 
(d)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (1) or (2) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Division 8 Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 46-1093(c) and the criteria in (1) and (2) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Division 8 Amendments. 
(1)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(e)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Division 8 Amendments. 
(f)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This article supersedes all the provisions of any village zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(2)  This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this article, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this article or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
(j)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This article does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(k)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the village for all annexed areas until the village adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the village's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the village zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

iv.  A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 
v.  The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used. 
vi.  A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure. 
vii.  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
viii.  Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
ix.  The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet. 
3.  Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway. 
i.  If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation. 
ii.  If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted engineering practices is provided. 
b.  Zone AE floodplains: 
1.  Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge. 
2.  Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following: 
i.  Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot. 
ii.  Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for department review. 
iii.  Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 
iv.  Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
v.  All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
vi.  Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated. 
3.  Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the department for review which meet the following conditions:

iii.  Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised 1% and 0.2% annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries. 
iv.  If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA mapping specifications. 
v.  The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain boundaries. 
vi.  All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme. 
vii.  Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on the map. 
viii.  The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map. 
(4)  Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this article shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be extended for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause. 
(c)  Certificate of compliance.

    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Unnecessary hardship. Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance. 
    Variance. An authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watershed. The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
    Water surface profile. A graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-33. - Exceptions and modifications. 
    Where, in the judgment of the plan commission, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of article III and article IV of this chapter because of the proposed subdivision being located outside of the corporate limits, or because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the village board, upon recommendation of the plan commission, may waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper. Such relief shall be granted without detriment to the public good, without impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter or the desirable general development of the community in accordance with an adopted comprehensive plan or component thereof. No exception or modification shall be granted unless the plan commission finds that all the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings: 
(1)  Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would result in severe hardship. Such hardships should not apply generally to other properties or be of such a recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed. 
(2)  Preservation of property rights. Such exception or modification is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity. 
(3)  Absence of detriment. The exception or modification will not create substantial detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public interest. 
(4)  Minimum required. A minimum of six affirmative plan commission member votes shall be required to recommend any exception or modification of this chapter to the village board. A simple majority vote of the plan commission quorum shall be required before recommending any exception or modification of this chapter to the village board, and the reason shall be entered into the minutes of the plan commission.

Sec. 50-34. - Land suitability. 
    No land shall be subdivided which is determined to be unsuitable for such use by the plan commission, upon the recommendation of the village engineer/DPW director, for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents or occupants of the proposed land division, or the village, or poses an imminent harm to the environment. The plan commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it based its conclusion that the land is not suitable for the intended use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal to such finding of unsuitability, if he so desires. Thereafter, the plan commission may affirm, modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. In addition, no lot served by public sanitary sewer facilities shall have less than 50 percent of its required lot area above an elevation at least two feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval flood.

Stats. § 236.13(5), within 30 days of notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action. The court shall direct that the plat be approved if it finds that the action of the approving or objecting agency is arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory.

Sec. 50-36. - Review and approval of extraterritorial plats and certified survey maps. 
    When it is proposed to divide lands or create condominiums located in the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the village, the subdivider shall proceed as specified in divisions 2 and 4 of this article, with the following exceptions or additions: 
(1)  It is recommended that prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map, the subdivider consult with the plan commission and/or village staff in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory, but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of the regulations of this chapter, and any existing village planning documents and ordinances; however, the plat or certified survey will not be reviewed by the village within the context of the land's proposed use. In so doing, both the subdivider and the village may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. The subdivider shall specify in his letter of application to whom the original application was submitted. 
(2)  If the subdivider elects to initially submit the proposed plat or certified survey map to the village, the plat or certified survey map shall be first submitted by the subdivider to the town clerk concerned. The town clerk shall then assume the responsibility for transmitting the plat or map to the objecting agencies and other approving authorities, including the village. 
(3)  Approving agencies include the village board, town board, and Waukesha County Planning Agency; and the subdivider must comply with the land division ordinances of the village, town, and county. 
(4)  The subdivider may proceed with the installation of such improvements and under such regulations as the town board of the town within whose limits the plat lies may require. Wherever connection to any village utility is desired, permission for such connection shall be subject to village board review and approval. 
(5)  All improvement requirements specified by the town board or any special improvements district in matters over which they have jurisdiction shall be met before the final plat is filed.

Stats. § 236.12(6), submit the original preliminary plat directly to the Director of Plat Review of the Wisconsin Department of Administration, who will prepare and forward copies of the plat at the subdivider's expense to the objecting agencies. When the subdivider elects to use this alternative procedure, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to submit to the village clerk the additional copies required for the reviews by subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  The village clerk shall also transmit copies of the preliminary plat to the plan commission and additional copies to village staff for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. The recommendations of village staff shall be transmitted to the plan commission within 30 days from the date the plat is received. The preliminary plat shall then be reviewed by the plan commission for conformance with this chapter and all other ordinances, rules, regulations and the comprehensive plan and components thereof.

(f)  Failure of the village board to take action on the plat within 60 days, the time having not been extended and no unsatisfied objections having been filed, and all fees payable by the subdivider having been paid, shall constitute approval of the plat. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-96. - Surveying and monumenting. 
    All final plats shall meet all the surveying and monumenting requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-97. - State plane coordinate system. 
    Where the plat is located within a U.S. Public Land Survey one-quarter section, the corners of which have been located, monumented and placed on the state plane coordinate system through high order horizontal control surveys conducted to standards established by the southeastern Wisconsin regional planning commission (SEWRPC), the plat shall be tied directly to two adjacent section or quarter-section corners (that is not the center of a section) defining a quarter section line so relocated, monumented and placed on the state plane coordinate system. The grid bearing and distance of such tie shall be determined by field measurements. The state plane coordinates, together with a description of the monuments marking the section or quarter-section corners to which the plat is tied, shall be indicated on the plat. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to the Wisconsin plane coordinate system, south zone, based upon the North American Datum of 1927 and shall be adjusted to the control survey network established to the standards promulgated by SEWRPC for the area concerned. 
    Where the field measurements differ from the control survey data by more than one part in 10,000, as an alternative to adjusting the field measured distances and bearings of the ties to the control survey network, the surveyor shall show both the measured field distances and bearings and the recorded and published control survey distances and bearings concerned. Under this alternative, the discrepancies shall be brought to the attention of the custodian of the control survey data for the area concerned by the surveyor. 
    All distances shall be recorded to the nearest 0.01 foot and all bearings to the nearest one second of arc. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error of closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-98. - Survey accuracy. 
    The village engineer/DPW director shall examine all final plats within the village and may make, or cause to be made by a registered land surveyor under the supervision or direction of the village engineer/DPW director, field checks for the accuracy and closure of survey, proper type and location of monuments and liability and completeness of the drawing. In addition: 
(1)  The maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundary of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in 10,000; nor, in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If filed measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure is obtained. When a satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained, the survey of the exterior boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure. 
(2)  All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an error for any interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 5,000, or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case exceed five minutes of arc. 
(3)  The village board shall receive the results of the village engineer/DPW director's examination prior to approving the final plat. The village engineer/DPW director may, however, in accordance with section 50-15(b)(4) of this chapter, waive the placing of monuments for a reasonable time, not to exceed one year, on the condition that the subdivider provide a letter of credit, certified check or surety bond equal to the estimated cost of installing the monuments, to ensure the placing of such monuments within the time required by statute. In that case, the village engineer/DPW director's examination required under this section and any related field checks shall be made after the required monuments have been installed. The letter of credit, certified check or surety bond concerned shall not be released until the village engineer/DPW director is satisfied with the accuracy of the land surveying concerned.

ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 50-161. - General requirements. 
    All plans and specifications for land divisions and condominium developments shall comply with design standards established herein and in adopted village ordinances, referenced Best Management Practices, and comprehensive plan or components thereof while encouraging alternative sustainable or green-related design standards where appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-162. - Street arrangement. 
    In any new land division or condominium, the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location indicated on the adopted village official map, Waukesha County Jurisdictional Highway System Plan and Village Comprehensive Plan or plan components thereof, including design guidelines. In areas where such plans have not been completed or are of insufficient detail, the street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and existing trees, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets, and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The land division or condominium shall be designed to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street. In addition: 
(1)  Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and planned system of arterial streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(2)  Collector streets. Collector streets shall be arranged to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the arterial street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches, shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the arterial streets to which they connect. 
(3)  Minor streets. Minor streets, sometimes called minor land-access streets, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient utilities, stormwater drainage and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(4)  Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the lot, parcel or tract being subdivided or developed unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the land division or condominium or for the advantageous development of the adjacent lands. 
(5)  Arterial street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed land division or condominium contains or is adjacent to an arterial street or highway, adequate protection of residential lots or dwellings, limitation of access to the arterial street or highway, and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, or by the use of alleys or frontage, cul-de-sac or looped streets. A restricted non-access easement along any property line abutting an arterial street or highway shall be required accordingly (see sections 50-163(1) and 50-169(d)). Permanent screening such as earth berms, decorative walls or fencing, landscape plantings, or any combination thereof, shall be required in any restricted non-access area (see section 50-163(1)). 
(6)  Stream or lake shore access. See section 50-171(b) of this chapter. 
(7)  Development control or reserve strips. Development control or reserve strips shall not be allowed on any plat or certified survey map to control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is placed with the village under conditions approved by the village board upon an affirmative recommendation from the plan commission and village engineer/DPW director. 
(8)  Access. Access shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas or mixed use thereof for off-street loading/unloading and service areas. 
(9)  Street names. Street names shall be approved by the village and shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names elsewhere in the village, but proposed streets that are extensions or continuations of others already in existence and named shall bear the names of the existing streets.. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-163. - Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way treatment. 
    Whenever a proposed land division or condominium contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, the design shall provide the following treatment: 
(1)  Non-access easement and planting area. When lots such as double or reverse frontage lots within a proposed land division or condominium back upon the right-of-way of an existing or planned limited access highway or railroad, a non-access easement (see section 50-169(d)) and planting area (sometimes called a landscaped buffer yard) at least 20 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. The typical lot depth for the land division should be increased 20 feet accordingly to accommodate the non-access easement and planting area. This non-access easement and planting area shall be a part of the platted lots and shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat or certified survey map: 
"This area is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs. No motor vehicle access shall be permitted across this area. The building of structures, except freestanding fences or walls for screening/buffering and public or private utility structures and fences, is prohibited hereon." 
(2)  Plats located in commercial and industrial zoning districts. Commercial and industrial properties shall provide, on each side of the limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad. A distance of not less than 150 feet shall be provided to allow for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and the highway or railroad. 
(3)  Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way. Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting an arterial street, another highway or collector street which crosses said highway or railroad, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of desirable approach gradients. 
(4)  Minor streets. Minor streets immediately adjacent to arterial street, highway and railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas. 
(5)  Shared driveway access. See section 50-169(d). 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-164. - Street, bicycle, pedestrian/recreation way design standards. 
(a)  Cross-sections. The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed streets shall be as specified by the adopted village official map, Waukesha County Jurisdictional Highway System Plan, or village comprehensive plan or component or amendment thereof. If no dimensions are specified therein, the minimum right-of-way and roadway widths shall conform to the village adopted street standards in consultation with and approval of the village engineer/DPW director. Street sections are for standard streets only. Cross sections for collector and arterial streets, freeways or expressways shall be based upon detailed engineering studies. 
(b)  Cul-de-sac and loop streets. Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not exceed 750 feet in length, unless otherwise approved by the village board and provisions are made for adequate emergency access. For lengths proposed to exceed 750 feet, the developer shall present extraordinary circumstances forcing the use of such lengths due to exceptional environmental constraints, the preservation of hilltops, irregular tract shape or other limiting factors; however, provisions for adequate emergency access must still be provided. 
    All urban cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 45 feet. If planting islands are provided, the street may also terminate in a tear-drop turnaround and the island shall have a minimum radius of 24 feet with a minimum right-of-way radius of 65 feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 48 feet. Islands within cul-de-sac turnarounds and "eyebrow" turnarounds (half circular culs-de-sac) may be allowed provided the islands are maintained by private means such as a homeowners or condominium association and meet the minimum design standards for such islands established in the village comprehensive plan. 
    Traffic lanes for loop streets and around center islands of cul-de-sac turnarounds may be one-way travel lanes as approved by the village board, after a recommendation from the plan commission and village engineer/DPW director, provided the inside diameter or length of loops do not exceed 200 feet. The pavement width of a one-way travel lane shall be at least 16 feet. Appropriate traffic signs, such as One-Way Only with directional arrows and Do Not Enter signs, shall be provided in the proper locations. 
(c)  Temporary termination. The temporary termination of streets intended to be extended at a later date shall be accomplished with the construction of a temporary circular- or "T"-shaped turnaround within the street right-of-way. Temporary turnarounds must be connected and extended when the adjoining property is developed. 
(d)  Bicycle and pedestrian/recreation ways. Bicycle and pedestrian/recreation ways with a right-of-way, outlot or public access easement width of not less than 20 feet may be required where deemed necessary by the plan commission to provide adequate bicycle, pedestrian and other recreational circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities. Recreation ways in wooded and wetland areas shall be so designed and constructed as to minimize the removal of trees, shrubs and other vegetation, and to preserve the natural beauty of the area. 
    Pedestrian/recreational paths required in accordance with section 50-196 of this chapter for proposed cluster development or conservation subdivisions may, in order to retain a rural country character, be meandering and constructed of asphalt or other equivalent materials in place of linear concrete sidewalks, upon approval of the village board after a recommendation from the plan commission and village engineer/DPW director. The village board may require the paths in such developments and their demarcations to be constructed by the developer prior to the sale of lots or dwelling units so that buyers are aware of their location. The paths shall be privately maintained by the homeowners or condominium association for the development. 
(e)  Grades. 
(1)  Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth, and indiscriminate leveling of the terrain. 
All changes in street grades that exceed one percent shall be connected by vertical curves that meet the standards for stopping sight distance established in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. 
(2)  Unless necessitated by exceptional topography, and subject to the approval of the plan commission, the maximum centerline grade of any street or public way shall not exceed the following: 
a.  Arterial streets: Six percent. 
b.  Collector, minor, cul-de-sac, loop and frontage streets and alleys: Eight percent. 
c.  Sidewalks: Five percent generally; however, this can be exceeded, up to 8.3 percent, for short distances (about 30 feet) where a landing is then provided in accordance with Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). 
d.  Pedestrian/recreational paths: 12 percent unless the developer presents extraordinary circumstances forcing the use of steeper paths due to exceptional environmental constraints, the preservation of hilltops, steep topography or other limiting factors subject to village board approval, after a recommendation from the plan commission and village engineer/DPW director. Paths intended to accommodate persons with disabilities shall follow the above ADAAG requirement for sidewalks. 
e.  [ Grade: ] The grade of any street shall in no case exceed eight percent or be less than one-half (0.5) of one percent, unless otherwise approved by the village board. 
(3)  The minimum grade of road crowns shall be two percent. Also, the change in grade across a street intersection within 100 feet of adjacent property/right-of-way lines shall not exceed three percent, and preferably should be limited to 1.5 percent. 
(f)  Crowns. Unless otherwise approved, roadway pavements shall be designed with a centerline crown. Offset crowns or continuous cross-slopes may be utilized upon approval of the village engineer/DPW director. Alley pavements shall be "v"-shaped, with a centerline gutter for drainage. 
(g)  Radii of curvature. When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by more than seven degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on such centerline of not less than the following: 
(1)  Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet. 
(2)  C ollector streets: 300 feet. 
(3)  Minor streets: 100 feet. 
Minimum curve radii shall be further based on the function of traffic speed, sight distances and other factors. A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(h)  Street elevations in floodplains. Elevations of all streets passing through floodplains shall be designed to not be overtopped by a 100-year recurrence interval flood. 
(i)  Bridges and culverts. All new and replacement bridges and culverts over navigable waterways, including pedestrian and other minor bridges, shall be designed to accommodate the peak rate of discharge of a 100-year recurrence interval flood event without raising the peak stage, either upstream or downstream, by more than 0.00 foot above the peak stage for the 100-year flood, as established by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Larger permissible flood stage increases may be acceptable for reaches having topographic or land use conditions which could accommodate the increased stages without creating additional flood damage potential upstream or downstream of the proposed structure, providing that flood easements or other appropriate legal measures have been secured from all property owners affected by the excess stage increases. Such bridges and culverts shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the passage of ice flows and other debris. 
    All new and replacement bridges shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable state regulations and shall be submitted to DNR, excluding ordinary maintenance repair or resurfacing of such bridges, to assure compliance therewith. 
(j)  Half streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half street is adjacent to the proposed land division or condominium plat, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of new half streets shall not be permitted. 
(k)  Passing lanes and acceleration/deceleration lanes. When the land to be subdivided is proposed to have a street connection to an arterial street, the village board, after a recommendation from the plan commission, may require that the subdivider install a "passing" or "bypass" lane adjacent to the traffic lane opposite the intersection as well as an acceleration and a deceleration lane adjacent to the traffic lane nearest the intersection, all of which shall be approved by the village engineer/DPW director. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-165. - Street intersections. 
(a)  Right angle. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. 
(b)  Hills. The location of street intersections immediately below the crest of hills shall be avoided. 
(c)  Maximum number. The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two. 
(d)  Number of intersections. The number of intersections along arterial streets and highways shall be held to a minimum. Whenever practicable, the distance between such intersections shall not be less than 1,200 feet. 
(e)  Continuation of minor and collector streets. Minor and collector streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial streets; but if the distance between the centerline intersection of such streets is less than 250 feet measured along the centerline of the arterial street, then the location of the collector and/or minor street shall be adjusted so that the distance is increased or the adjointment across the intersecting street is continuous and a jog is avoided. Such jogs for minor and collector streets intersecting other minor and/or collector streets shall not be less than 125 feet, otherwise the distance shall be increased or said streets shall be adjusted to be continuous in alignment. 
(f)  Corner curves. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded to an arc with a minimum radius of 15 feet, or greater radius if required by the village engineer/DPW director, or shall be cutoff by a straight line through the points of tangency of an arc having a radius of 15 feet or greater. 
(g)  Curb ramps or openings. On all streets where curbs and sidewalks are required, ramps or openings to accommodate persons with disabilities, including individuals in wheelchairs and personal assistive mobility devices, shall be provided in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.0909 and ADAAG requirements. 
(h)  Vision corner or clearance easements. Vision corner or clearance easements shall be provided at street intersections as required by section 46-921 of the Village Zoning Ordinance and by any approving or objecting authority concerned. (See Illustration 50-2) 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Editor's note- The illustration referenced above is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the village offices. 
Sec. 50-166. - Blocks. 
    The widths, lengths, shape and orientation of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, including supporting green development; zoning requirements; need for convenient pedestrian, bicycle and motor vehicle access; control and safety of street traffic; and the limitations and opportunities of topography and other natural resource features. In addition: 
(1)  Length. The length of blocks in residential areas shall not, as a general rule, be less than 600 feet nor more than 1,500 feet in length unless otherwise dictated by preservation of natural resource features, including exceptional topography, or other limiting factors of good design. 
(2)  Bicycle and pedestrian/recreation ways. Bicycle and/or pedestrian/recreation ways of not less than 20 feet in easement or right-of-way width may be required near the center and entirely across any block over 900 feet in length where deemed essential by the plan commission to provide adequate pedestrian, bicycle and other recreational circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities. 
(3)  Width. The width of blocks shall be wide enough to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth except where a single tier of lots may be necessary to separate developments from through traffic, such as with reverse frontage lots, or to protect and preserve natural resources. Width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and service (loading/unloading) areas required by the use contemplated and the area zoning regulations for such use. 
(4)  Utility easements. Utility easements for electric power, television cable, telephone and other communication facilities shall, where practical, be placed within midblock easements or along rear or side lot lines. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-167. - Lots. 
    The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the land division and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the building contemplated. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them. In addition: 
(1)  Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines on which the lots face, unless a non-conventional lot layout is approved by the plan commission. 
(2)  Double or reverse frontage lots. Double or reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Also see section 50-163(1). 
(3)  Access. Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least 40 feet on a public street or other village officially approved means of access. Also see section 50-169(d) pertaining to shared driveways. 
(4)  Lot area and dimensions. The area and dimensions of all lots shall conform to the requirements of the Village Zoning Ordinance, chapter 46 of this Code, for land divisions or condominiums within the village. Lots shall contain sufficient area to allow compliance with all required setbacks or yards, including those set forth in the Village Zoning Ordinance and those that may be required to meet the requirements of Wisconsin Administrative Code ch. Trans 233. 
(5)  Re-division of large lots. Wherever a lot, parcel or tract is subdivided into lots or parcels that are more than twice the minimum lot area required in the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located, the plan commission may require such lots or parcels be arranged and dimensioned to allow for the possible future re-division of such lots into lot sizes compatible with the zoning district. 
(6)  Depth. The typical lot depth in the land division should be increased relative to the width of any buffer strips required along abutting arterial streets, highways and railways. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of 2.5 to one (2.5:1) shall be considered a maximum ratio, unless a deeper lot is needed to accommodate buffers or to protect natural resources. The depth of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and service (loading/unloading) areas required by the contemplated use and the Village Zoning Ordinance. 
(7)  Width. The width of lots shall conform to the requirements of the Village Zoning Ordinance. The minimum lot width should be increased relative to the width of any required utility and drainage easement, bicycle way, pedestrian/recreation way, or landscaped buffer strip. 
(8)  Corner lots. The width of corner lots should be increased beyond the minimum lot width required in the Village Zoning Ordinance to allow adequate yards or building setbacks from two street yards. 
(9)  Shape. The shape of lots shall be approximately rectangular, with the exception of lots located on a curved street or cul-de-sac turnaround. Flag lots or easements or other lot stacking techniques shall be prohibited, except where necessary to accommodate exceptional topography, preserve natural resources, or address extraordinary circumstances subject to plan commission approval. 
(10)  Undeveloped lands and water edges. Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise undeveloped lands which lie between a proposed land division or condominium and the water's edge shall be included as part of outlots or public dedications if not developable (i.e. wetlands, floodplains or steep slopes), or as part of lots, outlots or public dedication if developable in any plat abutting a lake, stream or river. 
(11)  Remnants. Remnants of lots below minimum size remaining after subdividing a large tract shall be added to an adjacent lot, or a plan shown indicating future use of the remnant outlot, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. 
(12)  Restrictions prohibiting development. Whenever a lot appearing on a final plat, condominium plat or certified survey map is not intended to be buildable, or is intended to be buildable only upon certain conditions, an express restriction to that effect, running with the land and enforceable by the village, shall appear on the face of the plat or map. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-168. - Building setback lines. 
    Building setback lines appropriate to the location and type of development contemplated, which are more restrictive than the regulation of the zoning district in which the plat is located, may be required by the plan commission and shall be shown on the final plat, condominium plat or certified survey map. Examples of the application of this section would include requiring greater setbacks to meet the minimum lot width requirement at the setback line for lots on cul-de-sac or curved streets, conform to setbacks of existing adjacent developments (see section 46-15(e) of the Village Zoning Ordinance), accommodate a coving design, avoid placing buildings within buffers, easements or vision clearance triangles, protect natural resources, or conform to greater setbacks required by Wisconsin Administrative Code ch. Trans 233 for lots along arterial streets and highways. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-169. - Easements. 
(a)  Utility easements. The village requires utility easements of widths deemed adequate for the intended purpose as determined by the village engineer/DPW director. Such easements shall be located as determined by the applicable utility company and subject to approval by the village engineer/DPW director, but preferably should be located within midblock easements (see section 50-166(4)) or along rear and side lot lines, and shall be designed to avoid the location of such facilities as electric power transformers in the flow lines of drainage swales, ditches, and other utility easements. All lines, pipes, cables and similar equipment shall be installed underground unless the plan commission finds that the topography, soils, depth to bedrock, woodlands, wetlands or other physical barriers would make underground installation impractical, or that the lots to be served by said facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities and requiring underground installation would constitute an undue hardship upon the subdivider. Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric power, communications, and gas facility systems, including but not limited to substations, pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches, above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, junction boxes, meter points and similar equipment may be installed at ground level and shall be placed in an visually unobtrusive location or screened from public view while still maintaining necessary access. All utility easements shall be noted on the final plat, condominium plat or certified survey map followed by reference to the use or uses for which they are intended. 
(b)  Drainage easements. Where a land division or condominium is traversed by a drainageway or stream, an adequate easement shall be provided as required by the plan commission. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway or easement shall be subject to the approval of the village engineer/DPW director. Where necessary, stormwater drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow. These design details are subject to review and approval by the village engineer/DPW director. 
(c)  Conservation easements. See section 50-170. 
(d)  Vision clearance, cross-access, and controlled- and shared-access easements. The plan commission may require vision corner or clearance easements, cross-access easements, non- or controlled-access easements and shared-access easements as a condition of plat or certified survey map approval in order to prevent or minimize potential traffic hazards. Access provisions shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the safety and practicability of cross- and shared-access. If the location of cross-access is not known and is dependent on future development or site plan layout, then a note shall be added to the plat or certified survey map indicating that a cross-access shall be provided and the subject lot replatted accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-170. - Protection of natural resources. 
    Where natural drainage channels, floodplains, wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are encompassed in whole or in part within a proposed land division or condominium, the plan commission may require that such areas be dedicated or that restrictions, including conservation easements, be placed on the plat or certified survey map to protect such resources. The plan commission may further require that such areas be included in outlots designated on the plat or certified survey map and restricted from development, including those for common areas within conservation subdivisions. Conservation easements may be held by the Village of Hartland, a nonprofit conservation organization or another entity as approved by the village board. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-171. - Park, open space and other public sites. 
(a)  Dedication, reservation and impact fees. To properly locate and preserve sites for public parks, playgrounds, greenways, trail corridors, access to navigable waters, open space sites, libraries and other public purposes/lands as the village develops and to equitably apportion the cost of providing such public park, recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional population brought into the village by subdivision or condominium development, and pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 236.45(1), the provisions of this section are established. Each subdivider of land in the village shall, at the direction of the plan commission, either dedicate park, library, open space or other lands designated on the village official map or comprehensive plan or component thereof or reserve such lands to eventually be purchased and pay an impact fee under section 50-232 or, where no such lands are directly involved, pay an impact fee under section 50-232. Proposed school sites shall be reserved by the subdivider for future acquisition by the school board in accordance with section 50-171(a)(2), and an impact fee payment for public facilities other than schools is required in accordance with section 50-232. The plan commission, in coordination with the park, library or school board shall, at the time of reviewing the preliminary plat, condominium plat, certified survey map, or site plan for multifamily development, select one of the following options and record such selection in the minutes of the meeting at which the preliminary plat, condominium plat, certified survey map or site plan for multifamily development is presented for approval: 
(1)  Dedication of site option. Whenever a proposed public playground, park, greenway, trail corridor, library or other public lands designated on the village's official map or comprehensive plan or component thereof is encompassed, in whole or in part, within a proposed land division or condominium, the public lands shall be made a part of the subdivision or condominium plat or certified survey map and shall be dedicated to the public by the subdivider by mutual agreement of the subdivider and the village. 
(2)  Reservation of site option. Whenever a proposed public playground, park, greenway, trail corridor, library, school or other public lands designated on the village's official map or comprehensive plan or component thereof is encompassed, in whole or in part, within a proposed land division or condominium, the public lands shall be made a part of the subdivision or condominium plat or certified survey map and reserved at the time of final plat or certified survey map approval for a period not to exceed three years, unless extended by mutual agreement of the subdivider and village, for acquisition by the village, park board, library board or school board at a price agreed upon and set forth in the subdivider's agreement at undeveloped land prices. Impact fees will be required in accordance with section 50-232. If the land is not acquired within the three year time period set forth in this subsection, the land will be released to the owner from reservation. 
(3)  Impact fee option. If the proposed subdivision does not encompass a proposed public park, playground, library or other public lands, an impact fee in the amount specified in section 50-232 for public park, library or other certain facilities shall be paid to the village finance director/treasurer at the time building permits are issued for development within the plat, certified survey map, condominium or multifamily development. The amount of payment shall be computed using the table set forth in section 50-232. 
(b)  Navigable streams and lakeshores. Navigable streams and lakeshores shall have a public access way at least 60 feet in width platted to the low water mark at intervals of not more than one-half mile and connecting to existing public streets, unless wider access or greater shoreline intervals are agreed upon by the Wisconsin Department of Administration, DNR, and the village, as required by Wis. Stats. § 236.16(3). 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Secs. 50-172-50-190. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 50-191. - General requirements. 
    All required improvements shall be constructed in accordance with village plans and specifications. Such improvements may include those for green development and infrastructure subject to village engineer/DPW director approval on a case-by-case basis in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The cost for all required improvements shall be bourne by the subdivider unless alternative arrangements are agreed to and documented in the subdivider's agreement. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-192. - Survey monuments. 
    The subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15 and as may be required by the village engineer/DPW director. 
(Ord. No. 802-13, § 1(Att.), 4-22-2013) 
Sec. 50-193. - Grading. 
(a)  After the installation of temporary block corner monuments or other survey control points by the subdivider and after review and approval of street grades by the village engineer/DPW director, the subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all streets proposed to be dedicated in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the plan commission, upon the recommendation of the village engineer/DPW director. The subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the street rights-of-way to subgrade.

    Capital costs means the capital costs to construct, expand or improve public facilities, including the cost of land, and including legal, engineering and design costs to construct, expand or improve public facilities, except that not more than ten percent of capital costs may consist of legal, engineering and design costs unless the village can demonstrate that its legal, engineering and design costs which relate directly to the public improvement for which the impact fees were imposed exceed ten percent of capital costs. The term "capital costs" does not include other noncapital costs to construct, expand or improve public facilities, vehicles; or the costs of equipment to construct, expand or improve public facilities. 
    Developer means a person that constructs or creates a land development, including land divisions and condominium developments. 
    Impact fees means cash contributions, contributions of land or interests in land, or any other items of value that are imposed on a developer by the village under this section. 
    Land development means the construction or modification of improvements to real property that creates additional residential dwelling units within the village or that results in nonresidential uses that create a need for new, expanded or improved public facilities within the village. 
    Public facilities means all of the following: highways as defined by Wis. Stats. § 340.01(22) and other transportation facilities; traffic control devices, public sidewalks and pedestrian/recreational paths, facilities for collecting and treating sewage, facilities for collecting and treating storm and surface waters, facilities for pumping, storing and distributing water, parks, playgrounds and land for athletic fields, solid waste and recycling facilities, fire protection facilities, law enforcement facilities, emergency medical facilities and libraries. The term "public facilities" does not include facilities owned by a school district. 
    Service area means a geographic area delineated by the village within which there are public facilities. 
    Service standard means a certain quantity or quality of public facilities relative to a certain number of persons, parcels of land or other appropriate measure, as specified by the village. 
(b)  Imposed. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0617, impact fees are hereby imposed on developers as follows: 
(1)  Department of public works facilities. Fees for public facilities for the construction, expansion or improvement of such village facilities as streets and highways, traffic control devices, water distribution systems, stormwater management systems, sanitary sewerage systems, and solid waste and recycling facilities shall be as set by resolution of the village board. 
(2)  Park facilities. Fees for public facilities for parks, playgrounds or land for athletic fields shall be as set by resolution of the village board.

The dollar value of such on-site public facilities will be determined for each land development on a case-by-case basis in the manner described in the public facilities needs assessment. The developer will be required to either provide or pay for the above on-site public facilities. It is the finding by the village that such on-site public facilities are not impact fees regulated by Wis. Stats. § 66.0617 nor do such public facilities constitute other capital costs for which a credit against or reduction of impact fees may be required. 
(d)  Payment. Impact fees shall be paid by the developer or property owner to the village in full upon the issuance of a building permit by the village. 
(e)  Requirements for revenues. Impact fees collected shall be placed in a segregated, interest-bearing account and shall be accounted separately from other funds of the village. Impact fees and interest earned thereon may be expended only for capital costs for which the impact fees were imposed. 
(f)  Use/return. The village finance director/treasurer shall keep a record of the amount and date of each impact fee collected or expended by the village on a first-in, first-out basis. Impact fees, together with interest earned, which are not expended to pay capital costs for which they were imposed within the time periods described in this subsection shall be refunded to the current owner of the property to which the impact fees were imposed. The time periods for expenditure of impact fees are established as follows: 
(1)  With regard to impact fees collected on or before December 31, 2001, not later than December 31, 2012.

Sec. 66-12. - Moratorium regulating residency and presence restrictions for sex offenders. 
(a)  Findings and Intent. 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board defines a Designated Offender to mean a person who has been convicted of or has been found delinquent of or has been found not guilty by reason of disease or mental defect of a sexually violent offense and/or a crime against children which includes Crimes Placing Children at Risk defined and described within footnote 1; and, 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board has recently learned that there currently are 35 individuals who reside in the Village who reasonably meet the definition of a Designated Offender ; and, 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board has concluded that the number of Designated Offenders residing within the Village unreasonably exceeds the number of Designated Offender s residing within other communities in Waukesha County as demonstrated by the data contained in footnote 2; and, 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board has concluded that the Wisconsin Department of Corrections has facilitated the placement of such a high number of Designated Offenders within the Village because of the absence of any Village ordinance regulating the residence or presence of Designated Offender s near identified Child Safety Zones as described in footnote 3. 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board has been informed that the existence of a focused practice involving vigorous community policing whereby the Hartland Police Department has regularly tracked the presence of Designated Offenders residing in the Village and regularly interacted with them to remind them that their presence is known to law enforcement with the goal of deterring recidivism and discouraging the concealment of the residency of Designated Offenders in the Village; and 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board has now concluded that an ordinance regulating the residency and imposing presence restrictions for Designated Offenders is now warranted; and, 
    WHEREAS, The Village Board realizes that the formulation of a reasoned and defensible ordinance in light of current legal challenges to such ordinances will take a reasonable amount of time. 
(b)  Incorporation of Findings and Intent. The Findings and Intent section as well as all of the footnotes of this ordinance are fully incorporated and made a part of this section. 
(c)  Moratorium. The Village hereby declares a Moratorium prohibiting the establishment of a Temporary or Permanent Residence 4 by a Designated Offender within the Village until such time as the saturation level for Designated Offenders in the Village of Hartland reaches a factor of 1.1 or lower where the saturation level is determined by adding the number of Designated Offenders per square mile in Hartland plus the number of Designated Offenders per 1,000 population in Hartland and dividing the resulting figure by the sum of the number of Designated Offenders per square mile in Waukesha County net of Hartland plus the number of Designated Offenders per 1,000 population in Waukesha County net of Hartland. 
(d)  Draft Ordinance Under Consideration. By way of illustration only, a draft of a potential ordinance is appended as Exhibit A and the Village Board invites written comments regarding same and will consider commissioning a study that will inform the drafting of a potential ordinance. 
(e)  Appeal. Any individual may appeal to the Village Board the interpretation of or application of the Moratorium under this ordinance.

Sec. 66-32. - Curfew. 
(a)  Intent of section. The continuing urbanization of the western part of the county has been accompanied by a recent dramatic increase in drug usage, vandalism and other crime involving juveniles in the village. In light of the peculiar vulnerability of children, their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner, and the importance of the parental role in child rearing, the village board has determined that a juvenile curfew is necessary to reduce violence by and against juveniles; to reduce exposure of juveniles to drug trafficking and other criminal activity; and to aid parents and guardians in carrying out their supervisory obligations, and thereby promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public. 
(b)  Hours. No person under the age of 18 shall congregate, loiter, wander, stroll, stand or play upon any public street, sidewalk, highway, road, alley, park, vacant lot, public building, place of amusement or entertainment or any public place within the village, either on foot or in or upon any conveyance being driven or parked thereon, between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., unless accompanied by his parent, spouse, guardian or other adult person having legal care or custody of such person. This section shall not apply to any person under 18 years of age who is: 
(1)  Returning to his home directly from and immediately after the end of any civic, religious, educational, athletic or social event sponsored by any accredited school, tax exempt church or governmental unit or agency, which event such person could properly and did in fact attend.

(3)  Returning directly from or going directly to any other activity which has been specifically approved in advance in writing by his parent, spouse, guardian or other adult person having legal care or custody of such person, provided that such written approval is in the possession of such person while returning from or going to such other place or activity. 
(4)  Engaged in bona fide interstate travel either through the village or beginning or ending in the village. 
(c)  Responsibility of parents. No parent, spouse or guardian, or other adult person having legal care or custody of a person under the age of 18 years, shall suffer, permit, or by inefficient control, allow such person to violate the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, provided that any such parent, spouse, guardian or other adult person who shall have made a missing person notification to the law enforcement authorities shall not be considered to have suffered, permitted or allowed such a violation. 
(d)  Responsibility of operators of places of amusement. No person operating a place of amusement or entertainment within the village, or any agent, servant or employee of any such person, shall permit any person under the age of 18 years to enter or loiter in such places of amusement or entertainment during the hours specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, unless such person is accompanied by his parent, spouse, guardian or other adult person having legal care or custody of such person; provided, however, that a minor may enter the place of amusement or entertainment during the hours specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section only with the advance written permission and approval of his parent, spouse, guardian or person having legal custody of such minor to remain on the premises until 5:00 a.m. during a special event; and provided further that such written approval shall be accepted by the operator or his agent and with his permission.

Sec. 76-2. - Authority. 
(a)  This article is adopted by the Village of Hartland under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 61.354. This article supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under Wis. Stats. § 61.35 that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats. § 61.354, Wis. Stats. § 61.35 applies to this article and to any amendments to this article. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
(c)  The Village of Hartland hereby designates the director of public works, its village engineer and its building inspector, or their respective designees, to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(d)  The requirements of this article do not pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33 or any amendments thereto. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code. 
(Ord. No. 844-17, § 1, 10-9-2017) 
Sec. 76-3. - Findings of fact. 
    The Village of Hartland finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(6)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(7)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
(Ord. No. 844-17, § 1, 10-9-2017) 
Sec. 76-4. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, post- construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(4)  Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state. 
(5)  Limit nonpoint runoff pollution in order to achieve water quality standards. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Hartland that this article regulate post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Village of Hartland recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge from the site(s). Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Village of Hartland, it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

(b)  Plan. A written plan shall be developed in accordance with section 76-8 and implemented for applicable land development activities. 
(c)  Requirements. The plan required under section 76-7(b) shall include the following: 
(1)  Pollutant control. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to control total suspended solids and phosphorus carried in runoff from the post-construction site as follows: 
a.  BMPs shall be designed in accordance with Table 1 or to the maximum extent practicable as provided in section 76-7(b). The design shall be based on an average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. 
Table 1: Pollutant Reduction Standards Development Type Total Suspended 
Solids Reduction Phosphorus New Development 80% 30% In-fill development 80% 30% Redevelopment 60% of load from parking areas and roads 30%  
b.  Maximum extent practicable. If the design cannot meet a total suspended solids or phosphorus reduction performance standard of Table 1, the storm water management plan shall include a written, site-specific explanation of why the total suspended solids or phosphorus reduction performance standard cannot be met and why the pollutant loads will be reduced only to the maximum extent practicable. 
c.  Off-site drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from off-site shall be taken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP accordingly. 
(2)  Peak discharge. 
a.  Unless otherwise provided for in this section, all land development activities subject to this section shall establish on-site management practices to control peak flow rates of storm water discharged from the site. On site management practices shall be used to meet the following minimum performance standards: 
1.  The peak flow rates of storm water runoff from the development shall not exceed those calculated for the series of design storms specified in 76-7(c)(2)a.2. occurring under development conditions specified in 76-7(c)(2)a.4. Discharge velocities must be non-erosive to discharge locations, outfall channels, and receiving streams. Safe overland conveyance must be provided for discharges from the development. 
2.  The storm water management facilities shall contain sufficient storage to contain the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour rainfall event under developed conditions, while utilizing a peak discharge rate from the developed site which does not exceed the peak runoff rate from the site for a 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event under pre-development conditions. 
3.  By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the 10-year, 24-hour post-construction peak runoff discharge rates to the 2-year, 24-hour pre-development peak runoff discharge rate. 
4.  Pre-development conditions shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology. The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. However, when predevelopment land cover is woodland, grassland, or cropland, rather than using TR-55 values for these land use types, the runoff curve numbers in Table 2 shall be used. Peak discharges shall be calculated using TR-55 runoff curve number methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation depths, and the appropriate NRCS Wisconsin MSE3 precipitation distribution. On a case-by-case basis, the director of public works may allow the use of TP-40 precipitation depths and the Type II distribution.

However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
b.  Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than 40 percent and up to 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as medium and high density residential, multi-family development, industrial and institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 75 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
c.  High imperviousness. For development with more than 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns , infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
d.  [Pre-development condition.] Pre-development condition shall be the same as in Table 2 of the Peak Discharge section of this article.

c.  The following requirements shall be met: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the storm water management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation. 
2.  Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area. 
d.  This paragraph does not apply to:

Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in accordance with section 76-10. 
b.  Site grading. Site grading shall ensure positive flows away from all buildings, roads, driveways and septic systems, be coordinated with the general storm water drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties. 
c.  Street drainage. All street drainage shall be designed to prevent concentrated flows from crossing the traffic lanes to the maximum extent practicable. Design flow depths at the road centerline for on-street drainage shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. 
d.  Bridges and cross-culverts. All new or modified bridges and cross-culverts shall comply with applicable design standards and regulations, facilitate fish passage and prevent increased flooding or channel erosion upstream or downstream from the structure. All bridges and cross-culverts on collector and arterial roadways shall be designed to convey the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. All bridges and cross-culverts on local roadways shall be designed to convey 10-year, 24-hour design storm, while providing an overland flow path that does not impact any structures for the 100-year, 24-hour design storm. A floodplain analysis shall be required for all developments impacting a navigable waterway. This analysis must demonstrate no adverse offsite impacts, in accordance with state and federal regulations and may require larger structures than those specified above. Design flow depths at the road centerline for all crossings shall not exceed six inches during peak flows generated by the 100-year, 24-hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. All predevelopment run-off storage areas within the flow path upstream of bridges and cross-culverts shall be preserved and designated as drainage easements, unless compensatory storage is provided and accounted for in modeling. As-built documentation shall be submitted for all new or modified structures that are located within a mapped floodplain or that the director of public works, or village engineer determines to be necessary to maintain floodplain modeling for the applicable watershed.

(1)  If the snow or ice is not removed as provided in this section, a police officer shall notify the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property that the snow must be removed and/or the ice sprinkled with a substance which reduces the hazard within 12 hours after the notice is given. If the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property cannot be personally contacted after a reasonable effort has been made, the police officer shall place a distinctive notice on the front door of a building on the property which shall serve as notice that a violation of this section exists. 
(2)  The personal notice or placement on the building of such notice shall serve as a warning to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property for the period between November 1 of any year and October 31 of the following year, and any subsequent violation of this section will result in the issuance of a municipal citation to the person who is responsible for the removal of snow and/or ice from the sidewalk.

The abutting property owner shall construct the curb and gutter along or upon any street in the village and shall pay the entire cost of such construction, except that on corner residential and industrial lots the village shall pay 50 percent of such costs attributable to that portion of curb and gutter which extends along the short side of any such lot and except that on lots abutting on two streets, and which lots cannot be divided under village zoning regulations, the owner shall be assessed only for that portion of such lot which constitutes the front. The village shall be the sole judge of which portion of such lots constitute frontage. On curved streets the abutting property owner shall pay the entire cost of such construction. 
(d)  Notice.

(f)  No responsibility for injury or damages by village. The village shall assume no responsibility or liability for injuries or damages that result from fixtures owned or placed by a property owner on or adjacent to a village right-of-way. 
(g)  Inaction does not constitute consent.

(h)  Reservation of right to pursue legal action. The village reserves the right at any time to take appropriate legal action to ensure that a property owner be held responsible for injuries or damages which result from a fixture owned or placed by a property owner on or adjacent to the village right-of-way. 
(i)  Inaction by village does not preclude pursuit of corrective action. Inaction by the village shall not limit the ability of the village to prosecute, to the fullest extent, for any injuries, damages or violation of this Code or any other laws which result from a fixture owned or placed by a property owner on or adjacent to a village right-of-way.

DIVISION 3. - ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND REGULATIONS 
    The following rules, regulations and ordinances for the regulation of licensed plumbers, sewer users, property owners and others, are hereby adopted and established: 

Sec. 86-204. - General provisions. 
(a)  Agreement to Rules and Regulation. All persons now receiving sewerage service from the village or who may hereafter make application for such service or who otherwise receive such service, shall be considered as having agreed to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this article, as amended from time to time; and such agreement is a condition precedent to the provision of such sewerage service. 
(b)  [General conditions.] In addition to any rules, regulations, limitations, conditions, charges, or other provisions set forth in the agreements between the customer and the commission, the following general conditions shall apply in all cases where the commission provides wastewater conveyance and/or treatment services to a customer: 
(1)  Agreements with customers shall not be made unless the commission determines that adequate excess treatment capacity exists to provide service to the said customer, or unless the said customer agrees to pay all costs associated with upgrading the wastewater facilities to provide the additional capacity required. 
(2)  The agreements shall establish the allowable wastewater flows, loads, and wastewater characteristics which the customer will be allowed to discharge to the wastewater facilities; shall establish other conditions and limitations as required to protect the wastewater facilities and the proper operation thereof; shall establish the period of time for which the agreement will be valid; and shall establish penalties for violation of any of the provisions of the agreement. 
(3)  Under all agreements, the customer shall pay a fair and equitable portion of the wastewater facilities debt service costs, operation and maintenance costs, and replacement costs. 
(4)  The agreements shall assure continued customer participation in the debt service cost over the life of the agreement. Should the customer eliminate its discharge, the commission, at its option, may, in its sole discretion, elect to assign to another customer that portion of the design capacity of the wastewater facilities and debt service cost thereby relieving the customer of continued financial participation. 
(5)  In addition to any rules, regulations, requirements, restrictions, or provisions provided in the agreements between the customer and the commission, the customers shall be subject to the rules and regulations provided in this sewer use article, as applicable, and as may be amended or modified from time to time. 
(6)  Each customer shall secure passage within the jurisdiction served by it of a sewer ordinance substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 1; and such ordinance shall be so adopted on or before June 30, 2007. 
(7)  The method of connection of the customer's local wastewater collection system to the commission wastewater facilities shall be as specified by the commission. 
(8)  For all customers, facilities shall be provided to allow flow measurement and sampling of the wastewater discharged by the customer to the commission wastewater facilities. The construction, operation, and monitoring requirements for said facilities shall be consistent with the requirements of this article. The costs for installation, operation, and maintenance of said facilities shall be borne in entirety by the customer. Plans and specifications for said facilities shall be submitted to the commission for review and approval. 
(9)  All customers shall limit expansion and growth as required to maintain their wastewater discharge within the flow and/or load allocations stated in their agreements with the commission. Any customer which exceeds it allocated flows and/or load capacity shall be subject to fines, penalties, and surcharges as stated in their agreements with the commission, or, where the agreements do not specify fines, penalties and surcharges, as provided for in this article. 
(10)  Customers shall maintain, inspect, and repair their local wastewater collection systems as required to limit infiltration and inflow to non-excessive levels. Infiltration shall be considered excessive if the highest average flow, for the customer, recorded over a 14 day period, under seasonal high groundwater and dry weather conditions, exceeds 120 gallons per capita per day or the equivalent therefore. Combined inflow and infiltration shall be considered excessive if the maximum day flow for the customer exceeds 205 gallons per capita per day or the equivalent thereof. The commission may impose fines, penalties, and surcharges for excessive infiltration and/or excess infiltration and inflow; said charges shall be in addition to the user charge applied to the customer. 
(11)  In the event that the wastewater facilities need to be upgraded at any time in the future, all customers shall be required to pay a fair and equitable share of the costs of such upgrades. 
(12)  No customer shall allow an industrial user to connect to their local wastewater collection system without written approval from the commission. The requirements of this article shall apply to all industrial users discharging to the commission wastewater facilities, either directly or indirectly, through the local wastewater collection system of a customer or municipality. 
(13)  No customer shall allow septage, holding tank waste, or other hauled wastes to be discharged into their local wastewater collection system without written permission from the commission. 
(14)  No customer shall accept wastewater from any user located outside of the service area for the said customer as defined in the agreements with the commission. 
(15)  Extension, modification, or alteration of a Village of Hartland's or a customer's local wastewater collection system shall not be allowed without approval from the commission. Proposals for all extensions, modifications, or alterations to a customer's local wastewater collection systems shall be submitted to the commission for review and approval. Where said proposals for extension, modification, or alteration are approved by the commission, plans and specifications shall be submitted to the commission for review and approval. Submittal requirements shall be in accordance with the requirements set by the commission. 
(16)  Customers shall not expand their sanitary sewer service areas without approval from the commission. The customer shall submit a proposal for expansion of the sanitary sewer service area to the commission for review and approval. The proposal shall include sufficient information to verify that the additional flow from the said expansion will not result in exceedance of the customers flow allocation as defined in the agreement with the commission. In addition, commission approval of any sanitary sewer service area expansion shall be contingent on approval of the expansion by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission. 
(17)  Nothing in this article, or any agreements between the commission and a customer, shall be construed as granting the customer ownership of any part of the commission wastewater facilities or a voice in the government of the wastewater facilities, with the exceptions of the village and the city, which parties created the commission through the originating joint ordinance and in the 1978 Agreement. 
(18)  In the event that wastewater from an customer's wastewater collection system results in odor nuisance in, or corrosion of, the commission's wastewater facilities, then the commission may, upon reasonable notice, require the customer to install facilities to remedy the problem, or the commission may install said facilities and charge the cost to the customer. 
(19)  The provisions of this section shall have no application to the city or village when acting pursuant to the 1978 Agreement and the originating joint ordinance. 
(c)  Application for service. Every person desiring to connect property, buildings or structures to public sewers shall make application in writing to the village on such forms as are prescribed for that purpose, prior to commencing use of such service. The application must describe fully and truthfully all the wastes which are anticipated to be discharged. If the applicant is not the fee simple owner of the property, the written consent of the owner must accompany the application. Persons connected to the public sewers of the village are referred to herein as "users." By submitting such an application, all users are deemed to have agreed to be bound by this article, as amended from time to time. If it appears that the service applied for will not provide adequate service for the contemplated use, the village may reject the application. If the village approves the application, it shall issue a connection permit as shown on the application. No service shall be provided or application approved without prior payment of all applicable fees. 
(d)  Application fee. Where the application for service is for a connection to the village's public sewers, the application shall be accompanied by an application fee(s) in an amount to be determined from time to time by the village. Such fee shall cover the cost of processing the application and inspection of the connection. Application fees may vary in amount between residential users and commercial/industrial users. The payment of this fee shall be in addition to any connection fees that may be charged to or on account of new users by the village or by the Del-Hart Commission. 
(e)  Inspections. Any connection to the public sewers within the village shall be subject to the prior inspection and approval of the work by an authorized representative of the village. No trench or other excavation shall be filled, or any connection completed, without such prior inspection. The applicant requesting the connection shall reimburse the village for all inspection costs incurred, if not previously paid as part of the application fee. 
(f)  Disconnection and refusal of service. Sewer service may be disconnected or refused for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of this article, as amended from time to time; 
(2)  Violation of the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time; 
(3)  Failure to pay the application fee, any connection fee or delinquent sewer service charges of the user. 
(g)  Disconnection for delinquent accounts. A bill for service is delinquent if unpaid after the due date shown on the bill. The village may disconnect service for a delinquent bill by giving the user, at least eight calendar days prior to disconnection, a written disconnect notice which may be included in the bill for service. For purposes of this rule, the due date shall not be less than 20 days after issuance of the bill. The village may disconnect without notice where a dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any user for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of these rules and regulations or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the user's property.

Metering of user's flow shall be utilized to determine user fees charged such user by the village. Metering shall also be used as a means of verification by the village or commission, but shall not be used to reduce a user's connection charge from that determined through use of Schedule A. The connection charge shall be determined separately by the commission for each building in accordance with Schedule A. 
(b)  Payment required. For each connection of a building sewer to a public sewer within the village, there shall be paid to the village a connection charge as determined pursuant to the Del-Hart Ordinance and this article, as amended from time to time, together with any other tapping fees, impact fees or similar charges imposed under such ordinance for the privilege of connecting to the public sewers. Such connection charge shall be assessed to the person seeking the connection and shall be paid as a condition precedent to obtaining a building permit, or in the case where no building permit is sought, it shall be paid as a condition precedent to connection. The connection charge of the village shall be in such amounts and shall be paid at such time as the village may from time to time determine. Failure to pay any connection charge when due shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(c)  Amount of initial/additional connection charges. Connection charges applicable to the sanitary sewer system within the village, or any extension thereto, shall be as follows: 
(1)  Per DUE within the Village of Hartland: 
Year 2015 2016 2017 Amount $7,323.00 $7,323.00 $7,323.00  
(2)  Per DUE outside the Village of Hartland: 
Year 2015 2016 2017 Amount $9,154.00 $9,154.00 $9,154.00  
(d)  Annual adjustment to connection charge. Effective January 1 of the year after the last date referenced in section 86-276(c), and each calendar year thereafter, the connection charge shall be annually adjusted based upon changes to the "Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index" (the "index"), which index most closely reflects construction costs of the wastewater facilities. The adjustment shall reflect changes to the index during the period of July 1 through June 30 of each year. The connection charge shall be increased or decreased annually by the percentage increase or decrease (rounded) in the index, determined as of June of each year commencing with the year 2006. By way of example only, if the index in June of 2005 was 7629.95 and the index for June 2006 is 8010.00, the changes in the index represent a percentage increase of 5.0 percent for the 12-month period of time (June 2005 to June 2006). Accordingly, the connection charge would be increased by $183.00 (rounded) for an adjusted connection charge of $3,840.00, rounded, for the year 2007. The commission shall notify all municipalities no later than November 1 of each calendar year (commencing on November 1, 2006) of the adjusted connection charge for its facilities to become effective as of January 1 of the succeeding year. The connection charge shall be in the amount so determined for the calendar year within which a permit is issued by the customer to allow for the user building sewer to be connected to the sanitary sewer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, the commission may by resolution duly adopted on or before December 31 of any year, elect not to adjust the connection charge for the succeeding calendar year whenever the commission determines that the public interest will be served thereby. 
(e)  Application of connection charge. In collecting the connection charges, the following shall apply: 
(1)  The connection charge is applicable to new users of the wastewater facilities as well as existing users who substantially increase their wastewater discharges to the wastewater facilities. For existing users, an additional connection charge is due when the average daily flow from such user increases by one DUE or more over an average 24-month period, the first 12 months of which is determined on a July 1 through June 30 time period or other continuous 12-month period based on the village's meter reading schedule. The commission shall establish the initial or increased DUE by the process established in the commission ordinances. 
(2)  A user and/or customer shall have the right to appeal the aforesaid determination of initial or additional DUEs by the process established and administered by the commission. 
(3)  An adjusted connection charge, Del-Hart is a charge against a customer resulting from new users or existing users substantially increasing their wastewater discharges, where those users are located within the area served by the said customer and who connect a building sewer that discharges to the wastewater facilities. 
(4)  DUEs shall be determined for all uses in accordance with the ordinances of the commission in effect and as amended from time to time. Attached hereto and incorporated herein is Schedule A, which is a conversion schedule for determining DUEs applicable to various types of properties and uses thereof; and shall be used by the customer for purposes of determining applicable DUEs, either for new users or users who substantially increase their wastewater discharges. Once a connection charge has been finally determined and paid, and following expiration of all applicable time periods within which an appeal may be taken, the connection charge shall not be subject to refund, even if the user in question changes its use in such manner that fewer DUEs are applicable thereto. Under no circumstance shall there ever be less than one DUE for each building sewer connected to a sanitary sewer, unless the commission by resolution determines otherwise. The commission may at any time require a user to install appropriate meters to determine whether or not increased wastewater flows have or are occurring relative to the property in question in accordance with section 86-278 of this Code.

Sec. 86-277. - Regional sewer availability charge. 
(a)  Established. Pursuant to the authority granted under Wis. Stats. § 66.0821, a regional sewer availability charge ("RSAC") is hereby established to provide for the recovery of construction, reconstruction, improvement, and/or extension costs and expenses that have been, or will be, incurred by the village or advanced to the village by contract, for purposes of facilitating extension(s) of the village's sanitary sewer system to service to a specific geographic area. 
(b)  Assessed. Each new sanitary sewer user, or existing user who increases its use to require additional capacity in the treatment facility, shall be charged a regional sewer availability charge ("RSAC"). For purposes of this section a "new sanitary sewer user" shall mean any person paying a sanitary sewer connection charge to the village for a property after October 1, 2003 and an "existing user" shall mean any person having an existing connection to the village sanitary sewer system as of October 1, 2003. The RSAC charge shall be assessed as follows: 
(1)  For property located within the geographic area depicted as North Side Area A in Exhibit A [7], the charge per DUE, in addition to the charge assessed under subsections 86-276(c) and (d), shall be as follows:

Year 2015 2016 2017 Amount $1,690.00 $1,690.00 $1,690.00  
(c)  Payment due. 
(1)  Payment of the RSAC. The building inspector shall collect the RSAC required under this section at the time of application for a building permit unless: 
a.  A prior payment of the initially applicable RSAC has been made to the village for the applicable property as part of a development agreement with the village; or 
b.  The village board, in is sole discretion, permits payments to be made in installments over a period of years established by the village board, but not to exceed 15 years, together with interest on the unpaid balance at a rate determined by the village board. The applicant for such an installment plan shall be deemed to agree that if such installment payments are not made when due, the same shall be assessed against the real estate served by the sanitary sewer and collected in the same manner as other taxes are collected by the village. 
(d)  Payment of RSACs associated with any subdivision created after April 1, 2005, shall be paid by the developer at the time of entry into the development agreement with the village. 
(e)  Payment of any RSAC resulting from assessment of additional DUEs against an existing user due to an increase in use of sewer capability shall be made within 30 days of the date of notice of reassessment. 
(f)  Each RSAC assessed by or pursuant to this section is hereby made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the sanitary sewer system of the village and if the same is not paid within the period allotted for such payment, such charge shall constitute a lien on the property served and be inserted in the village tax roll as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0809. 
(g)  The wastewater service charges taxed or levied pursuant to this section shall be payable to the village at the municipal building.

Editor's note- Exhibit A, referenced above, is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the village offices. 

Sec. 86-278. - When flow meters are required. 
(a)  The commission or the Village of Hartland may require institutional, governmental, commercial, and industrial users to install metering equipment, including water flow meters or wastewater flow meters, for the purpose of more accurately determining the volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater facilities, whenever any of the following exist: 
(1)  The commission or the Village of Hartland believes that the discharge flow from a user may significantly exceed the flow expected for that user based on the number of DUEs assigned to that user consistent with the DUE determination calculated under this article (Schedule A); 
(2)  The user discharges industrial wastewater to the wastewater collection system; 
(3)  The commission or the Village of Hartland believes that a user may discharge more than one DUE of wastewater; 
(4)  The user discharges wastewater with BOD5, TSS, TKN, or Total Phosphorus concentrations greater than the concentration limits for domestic wastewater as defined in this article; 
(b)  Where water meters are required to be installed by the commission or the Village of Hartland, the water meters shall be furnished by the Village of Hartland and installed by a licensed plumber while a representative of the Village of Hartland is present to observe and inspect said installation. All costs for the installation of the water meters shall be at the expense of the user requiring the water meter. Meters shall be calibrated and maintained in accordance with the policies of the Village of Hartland. Where water enters the user's premises from more than one source, water flow meters shall be installed at each source. The Village of Hartland shall provide water meter readings to the commission for the subject property on a quarterly basis with the readings being provided no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. Water usage shall be the measure for determining the monthly user charge fees and surcharge fees where applicable. The initial assignment of DUEs to such user, the initial monthly user charges and the initial connection charges shall be based upon reasonable estimates prepared by the commission, subject to adjustment as herein provided. In the event that, after a period of one year (which year shall be determined as beginning on the July 1 immediately following the date that the water meter is installed), the water meter readings indicate that the water consumption at the property is in excess of the original estimate, the commission shall give to the user an initial notice pursuant to the process set forth in the commission's ordinances. If the said user's average wastewater discharge continues at such increased amount for the second 12-month period following the date of expiration of the first 12 months, then the said user shall be (i) billed additional connection charge(s) based on such increased flows and (ii) billed prospectively an increased user charge, based on the difference in the DUE values before and after the meter was installed. In such event, the commission shall issue a final notice pursuant to the process set forth in the commission's ordinances. 
(c)  In the event that a user, who is required by the Commission or the Village of Hartland to install a flow meter for the purposes of determining the volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater facilities, produces evidence satisfactory to the Village of Hartland and Commission that a significant percentage of the total annual volume of metered water used is not discharged into the sanitary sewer, the user may be allowed to have an exemption water meter(s) installed. Said meter(s) shall be furnished by the Village of Hartland. All costs shall be at the expense of the user requiring the meter(s), including installation and piping revisions required to insure that any water not reaching the sanitary sewer is metered by the exemption meter. The Village of Hartland may establish charges for each size meter to compensate for furnishing, reading and servicing the meter. The amount of exemption water metered shall be subtracted from the total amount of water used by the user to determine the applicable user charge fee. Regardless of the amount of metered exemption water, no user shall be charged for less than one DUE for each single building sewer connected to a sanitary sewer, unless the commission determines otherwise. 
(d)  The commission may require industrial users to install wastewater flow meters on the user's building sewer in accordance with the requirements of this section. In such cases, the wastewater flow meter readings shall be used as the measure for determining the monthly user charge fees.

(a)  Protection barrier. A protection barrier (tree protection zone) shall be installed around the tree or trees to be preserved whenever work is being done on or near public property that may result in damage to a public tree or trees. The barrier shall be constructed of durable fencing material, such as plastic construction fencing, snow fence, or chain link fencing. The barrier shall be placed as far from the base of the tree(s) as possible, preferably at the drip line (see recommended chart below). The fencing shall be maintained in good repair throughout the duration of the project, and shall not be removed, relocated, or encroached upon without permission of the village forester. 
Guidelines for Tree Protection Zones 
Species Tolerance To Impacts Tree Age Distance From Trunk * (feet per inch of trunk diameter) Tolerant young 
< 1/4 life expectancy 0.5' middle-aged 
1/4-3/4 life expectancy 0.75' mature 
> 3/4 life expectancy 1.0' Intermediate young 0.75' middle-aged 1.0' mature 1.25' Sensitive young 1.0' middle-aged 1.25' mature 1.5'  
* These distances are based on a tree's tolerance to root pruning and soil disturbance and may not be adequate to protect branches of young trees or other trees with low branches. Because severe pruning would destroy the form of such trees, fencing at the drip line should be considered. 
(b)  Storage of materials. No person shall store materials or supplies of any kind within the tree protection zone. Concrete and cement materials, block, stone, sand, and soil shall not be placed within the drip line of the tree. 
(c)  Fuel/hazardous substance discharge. No person shall discharge any petroleum product or hazardous substance within 150 feet of any tree protected by this division in a manner that may reasonably be expected to be harmful to a tree. 
(d)  Debris and waste materials. Debris and waste from construction or other activities shall not be permitted within the tree protection zone. Wash down of concrete or cement handling equipment, in particular, shall not be permitted within 150 feet of protected trees. 
(e)  Grade changes. Any grade changes proposed within the tree protection zone shall be approved by the village forester prior to any work taking place. Precautions shall be taken to mitigate potential injuries. 
(f)  Damages to roots and branches. Any damages or injuries to a public tree shall be reported to the village forester as soon as possible. Severed roots shall be pruned cleanly to healthy tissue, using proper pruning tools. Broken branches or limbs shall be pruned according to ANSI A300 (Part 1)-2001 Pruning Standards. 
(g)  Boring and trenching. To preserve viable root systems and maintain structural stability, boring or tunneling beneath root systems of public trees is required. Open-cut excavating is allowed only up to the distance from various sized trees listed below. The boring or tunneling from trench to trench shall be below the minimum depth indicated for tree size. The surface area and subsoil directly adjacent to public trees shall not be disturbed as follows: 
Tree Size 
(diameter in inches) Min. Undisturbed Radius 
(measured from face of trunk) Min. Depth of Tunnel/Bore Less than 3" 3 feet 3 feet 3" through 8" 6 feet 3 feet 8+" through 14" 8 feet 4 feet Larger than 14" 10 feet 4 feet

    As a condition of any building, demolition or other similar permit issued by the village, all persons issued such permit shall take necessary steps to protect the short and long term health of all nearby public trees which may be injured by such operations. 
(Ord. No. 696-04, § 1, 10-25-2004) 
Sec. 90-50. - Building moving permits. 
    No person shall move any building, structure, or object exceeding 13.5 feet in height or width upon, over, or along any public right-of-way or other public place without first obtaining approval from the director of public works or his designee. The village may require the applicant to furnish a bond or cash deposit in the amount to be determined based on existing conditions to cover the cost of repairing or replacing any public trees or shrubs which are injured as a result of the moving operations. The director shall specify the route to be taken and impose any other conditions reasonably necessary for the protection of nearby public trees from injury. 
(Ord. No. 696-04, § 1, 10-25-2004) 
Sec. 90-51. - Adjacent landowner responsibility. 
    No person shall remove, trim, cut roots, or disturb any public tree on any street, park, or other public place without a permit. The person receiving the permit shall abide by this division and the standards set forth by the village forester. 
(Ord. No. 696-04, § 1, 10-25-2004) 
Sec. 90-52. - Interference with village. 
    No person shall prevent, delay, or interfere with the village, or any of its agents, while they are engaging in and about the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying, or removing of any street trees, park trees, or trees on private grounds, as authorized by this division.

Editor's note- See the editor's note to Art. II. 

Sec. 90-71. - Intent. 
    This division is intended to provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development and/or building construction process.

ARTICLE I. - DELAFIELD-HARTLAND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL COMMISSION 

Sec. 13.09. - Subsections (3)-(8). 
(1)  Created. There is created a joint commission to represent the City of Delafield and Village of Hartland. Such commission shall be known as the "Delafield-Hartland Water Pollution Control Commission" (hereafter called the "commission"), pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.30. The purpose of this commission is to provide sewage collection, treatment and distribution services for the municipalities and such persons, organizations or municipalities as the commission may contract with. The commission has not been created for profit, and no part of any net income of the commission shall inure to the benefit of any individual, organization or association created for profit. 
(2)  Membership. 
(a)  Number of members. The commission shall be composed of eight members, four selected by each municipality. 
(b)  Selection. The members selected by each municipality shall be appointed by the mayor or village president, as the case may be, and such appointment shall be confirmed by a majority vote of such municipality's governing body. 
(c)  Term of office. The term of office of all commission members shall be for three years commencing on June 1 and ending on May 31. 
(d)  Removal. Any commission member selected by a municipality may be removed without cause by a four-fifths vote of the governing body of such municipality; provided, however, that such removal shall become effective only upon the appointment of a successor member pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. For purposes of subsection (e) of this section, such a vote to remove a commission member shall be deemed to create a vacancy in such member's office, notwithstanding the fact that such member shall continue to hold such office until his successor shall be appointed. Upon such removal, the clerk of such municipality shall notify the clerk of the commission in writing of such removal. 
(e)  Vacancies. A vacancy in the office of a commission member created for any reason shall be filled by the municipality from which such member has been previously selected by the appointment of a successor member by the chief executive officer of such municipality, which such appointment shall be confirmed by a majority vote of the governing body of such municipality. Each successor so selected shall serve the remaining term of the member whose office has been vacated. 
(f)  [Reserved.] 
(g)  Alternate members of the commission. In recognition that members of the commission may be unable to attend meeting(s) of the commission due to absence, illness or other reason, the presiding officer of the municipality (i.e., the mayor or village president, as the case may be), shall appoint at least two alternate members who can fill in whenever appointed members are unable to attend any meeting of the commission. Alternate members shall serve a term of one year or until their successor(s) shall have been duly appointed. Whenever it shall appear to the chairperson of the commission, or to the chairperson's designee, that one or both of the municipalities will not have all of the members appointed by such municipality present at any meeting of the commission due to illness, absence or otherwise, the chairperson may communicate the need for one or more alternate members to attend such meeting, by contacting the presiding officer of the municipality (the mayor or village president). The mayor or village president, as the case may be, shall designate an alternate member to attend such meeting in place of the member who is not able to attend; and in such event, the alternate member shall have the same power and authority as the member in question. The alternate member may continue to attend all meetings of the commission until such time as the member (in whose stead the alternate member has been so designated) is able to attend meeting of the commission. Alternate members shall be appointed by the mayor or village president in writing, which writing shall be filed with the city or village clerk, as the case may be, and with the clerk of the commission. 
(3)  Officers. 
(a)  Offices designated. The officers of the commission shall be a chairman, vice-chairman, clerk and treasurer. In addition to the foregoing officers, the commission may appoint a deputy clerk and deputy treasurer.

(b)  Selection and term of office. Each commission officer shall be selected from among the membership of the commission at the commission's regular June meeting each year and shall serve for a term of one year and until such officer's successor shall be elected and qualified. The vice-chairman shall be selected from the municipality other than the municipality from which the chairman serving the same term has been selected. 
(c)  Removal. Any commission officer may be removed from office by a vote of the majority of all the commission members.

The commission shall purchase liability insurance naming the commission, its members, employees and the municipalities as insureds with such coverages, from such companies and in such coverage amounts as the commission shall determine, subject to approval by the governing bodies of the municipalities. 
(d)  Financing of the commission. 
1.  Budget. In August of each year, the commission shall prepare and adopt a budget for the next succeeding calendar year. Until the commission shall receive the proceeds from the first mortgage revenue bonds issued by the commission, such budget shall be submitted to the municipalities for approval. No disbursements shall be made by the commission for any item included in a budget until such budget shall have been approved by the governing bodies of the municipalities. No disbursements shall be made for any item, which disbursements in the aggregate exceed the total amount budgeted for such item without the consent of the governing bodies of the municipalities. After the commission shall have received the proceeds of such mortgage revenue bonds, each budget adopted by the commission shall be submitted to the municipalities for information purposes only, and neither the nature nor amounts of disbursements made by the commission for items included in such budget shall be subject to approval by the governing bodies of the municipalities. 
2.  Financial reports. The commission shall annually cause to be prepared audited financial statements and shall deliver a copy of such financial statements to the clerk of each municipality. 
3.  Mortgage revenue bonds. The commission may issue its mortgage revenue bonds to the extent permitted by law in order to provide funds to carry out the purpose for which the commission has been created as specified in subsection (1) hereof. 
4.  Revenue contracts. The commission shall negotiate and enter into contracts with the municipalities and with any other person, organization or municipality which shall be authorized, pursuant to subsection (6) hereof, to use the commission's sewage facilities, pursuant to which the commission shall agree to provide the use of its sewage collection, treatment and distribution facilities in consideration of: a covenant by each such user not to make use of the sewage facilities as may be owned by such user, other than the commission's sewage facilities so long as any mortgage revenue bonds issued by the commission shall be outstanding; and, payment by each such user of an amount which the commission estimates will, when combined with the amounts to be paid to the commission by all other users of its sewage facilities reduced by all amounts received by the commission from sources other than users of its facilities, be sufficient to pay the following expenses as the same become due and payable: 
a.  All expenses incurred by the commission in connection with the operation and maintenance of its sewage facilities including the overhead expenses of the commission and its employees. 
b.  All expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds and the principal and interest payments to be made on such bonds; and which will be sufficient to establish any reserve for depreciation with respect to the commission's sewage facilities which the commission shall determine is necessary in order to pay the costs of any replacement or extensions of or any improvements or additions to the commission's sewage facilities. Subject to the requirements of the foregoing sentence, such contracts shall contain such provisions as the commission shall deem appropriate, and the commission shall not be required to contract with any user of the commission's sewage facilities upon the same terms as any or all other users of such facilities. Such contracts may be amended from time to time as the commission deems appropriate. 
(e)  Examination of books and records. The commission shall permit the officers of both municipalities or their duly authorized agents to inspect the books and records of the commission at any time. 
(6)  Purchase and operation of sewerage treatment plant and interceptors. 
(a)  The city council and village board hereby agree to purchase necessary land and construct a sewerage treatment plant and interceptor mains as may be necessary to jointly service the sewerage disposal needs of the city and village as they may require. The Delafield-Hartland Water Pollution Control Commission is hereby authorized to commence negotiations necessary to purchase and construct the plant and to report its progress thereon. 
(b)  The sewerage treatment plant and interceptors shall be jointly owned, financed and maintained on a 50-50 basis by the two municipalities. 
(c)  Once the plant and interceptors are in operation, flowage meters shall be installed, and each municipality shall pay for the actual usage of the plant at such rate as may be established by the commission. Each municipality shall pay according to the percentage of flow usage. 
(d)  The Delafield-Hartland Water Pollution Control Commission shall have the responsibility to operate, manage and control the treatment plant and interceptors on behalf of the city and village. 
(e)  Each municipality shall be solely responsible for construction, maintenance and control of its own sewerage disposal mains, laterals and layout wherever not jointly used by the municipalities. 
(7)  Additional users. The commission may enter into contracts, as provided in subsection (5)(d)4 hereof, with any person other than the municipalities of Hartland and Delafield for the purpose of providing to such other contracting party the use of the commission's sewage facilities. As used in this section, the term "municipality" shall include any city, village, town, town sanitary district or school district. Each municipality covenants that it will not enter into a contract with any person to provide the use of the municipality's sewer utility services unless: 
(a)  Within a reasonable time after learning of such person's, organization's or municipality's interest in obtaining the use of such sewer utility services, such municipality shall inform the commission in writing of such interest. 
(b)  The commission shall either: 
1.  Waive in writing delivered to the clerks of both municipalities its right to contract directly with such person pursuant to this subsection; or 
2.  Fail, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice from such municipality, to execute such a waiver or to deliver to the clerk of such municipality written notice of its intent to enter into such a contract. 
(8)  Termination of the commission. The commission may be terminated at any time upon the majority vote of the governing bodies of the municipalities; provided, however, that the commission shall not be terminated unless all of its outstanding indebtedness shall have been paid in full, or funds shall have been irrevocably set aside in an amount sufficient to pay such indebtedness in full along with all interest accruing thereon and any other charges related thereto. Upon such termination: 
(a)  Title to all assets owned by the commission other than cash and marketable securities shall vest in both municipalities as tenants-in-common, each having an undivided one-half interest in such assets. 
(b)  After all of the commission's liabilities have been satisfied and provision has been made for the satisfaction of any and all of the commission's contingent liabilities, all remaining cash and marketable securities of the commission shall be paid and distributed to the municipalities in equal shares. 
(9)  Amendment. This section shall not be amended except by an ordinance adopted by both the village and the City of Delafield. 
(a)  If the governing bodies of the city and village cannot agree on any decision regarding such jointly owned treatment plant or interceptors, the matter shall be submitted to an arbitration committee consisting of a representative picked by the city, a representative picked by the village and a third member chosen by the two representatives. The arbitration committee shall schedule a date for a hearing. The arbitration committee, before deciding the dispute, shall call for and consider the recommendation of the Delafield-Hartland Water Pollution Control Commission. 
(b)  The decision of the arbitration committee shall be binding and the municipalities hereby agree to abide by the decision. There shall be no right of appeal except in the event the decision is arbitrary and capricious or in violation of the law and then the appeal shall be to the Circuit Court of Waukesha within 30 days of the decision. The appeal shall be in the form of a declaratory judgement on the record.
