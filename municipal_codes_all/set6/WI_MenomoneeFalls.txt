PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Code, as supplemented through January 31, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and Robert D. MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Richard A. Farrenkopf, Village Manager, Mr. Mike Morse, Village Attorney, and Ms. Kathy Milbrath, Director of Clerk Services, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

(b)  To provide for the orderly acquisition of property for permanent improvement projects contemplated by the village, to minimize the cost thereof by avoiding further improvements thereon, the cost of which would ultimately be borne by the village at the time of purchase or condemnation, to ensure the prompt and least expensive acquisition of property in the village by other governmental organizations, and to best serve the general interest, convenience and necessity, this section is enacted to expedite and systematize the purchase of such property. 
(Code 1963, § 14.05(11)) 
Sec. 18-54. - Refusal.

Sec. 18-62. - Stormwater disposal requirements. 
(a)  No permit will be issued for the erection of a building upon a lot within the limits of the village which lies in a natural drainage area where no storm sewer is available.

Changes of use or modifications of existing buildings or structures shall follow the same procedure. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, written requirements shall be secured from the fire department relating to fire safety measures of the proposed development. 
(Code 1963, § 14.05(5)(m)) 
Sec. 18-65. - Permit fees.

(b)  The deposit monies may, when required, be used by the village as reimbursement to restore water stop boxes to the finished yard grade elevation and be operational; to repair damage to street pavement and/or curbs and gutters; to repair damage to swales, ditches and/or culverts; or to repair other damage done to public facilities during the construction of the building or structure. 
(c)  Only after an occupancy permit has been issued will the deposit monies be refunded to the person having paid such deposit, subject then to all the conditions set forth in this section. 
(d)  The full allocated amount of the building deposit shall be forfeited if any contractor fails to request a final inspection and if the building or structure is occupied without final approval or issuance of an occupancy permit by the village manager or designee. If a deficiency or noncompliance is observed upon the final inspection, the contractor shall, within 45 days from the date of written notice, provide compliance and request a final reinspection. Failure to complete work or request a final reinspection within the 45 days shall provide for automatic deposit forfeiture. Forfeiture of deposit monies does not in any manner relieve the owner and/or contractors of the obligation and responsibility for completion in compliance to applicable codes and laws. Reinspection fees shall be charged as set forth in the permit fee schedule. If a deficiency or noncompliance is observed before the final inspection, the contractor shall, within 45 days from the date of written notice, provide compliance. Failure to complete compliance within the 45 days shall provide for automatic authorization for the village to repair or restore the damaged facilities. Village costs incurred during repair or restoration shall be deducted from the deposit monies; any costs over the amount of the deposit shall be billed to the contractor.

Sec. 38-202. - Findings of fact. 
    The village board of trustees finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants; 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads; 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities; 
(6)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes; 
(7)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and 
(8)  Aggravate excessive infiltration and inflow of water into sanitary sewer connections during peak storm events causing the conveyance system to surcharge, overflow or backup into basements. 
(Ord. No. 450-O-09, § 2, 6-15-09) 
Sec. 38-203. - Purpose. 
    This chapter integrates federal and state construction post-construction site stormwater water quality standards with duties to reasonably manage the quantity of water run-off for regional flood abatement. This chapter implements the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District rules on release rates for development creating more than a de minimis amount of new impervious surface, to reduce the probability of increased regional floods as the metropolitan area approaches full build-out forecast for 2050. 
(Ord. No. 450-O-09, § 2, 6-15-09) 
Sec. 38-204. - Stormwater quality and quantity management applicability. 
(a)  The water quality management duties apply to property development disturbing one or more acres after March 10, 2003, and the water quantity management duties apply to development that increases impervious surface by 10,000 square feet or more (0.23 acres), unless the site is exempt under subsection (c). 
(b)  This article applies to post construction sites within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the village. 
(c)  A site meeting any one of the following criteria is exempt from stormwater requirements: 
(1)  Water quality management duties do not apply if: 
a.  A redevelopment post-construction site with no increase in exposed parking lots or roads. 
b.  A post-construction site with less than ten percent connected imperviousness based on complete development of the post-construction site, provided the cumulative area of all parking lots and rooftops is less than one acre. 
c.  Nonpoint discharges from agricultural facilities and practices. 
d.  Nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities. 
e.  Routine maintenance for project sites under five acres of land disturbance if performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity or original purpose of the facility. 
f.  Underground utility construction, but not including the construction of any above-ground structures associated with utility construction. 
(2)  Water quantity management duties do not apply if: 
a.  Residential infill where the lot is five acres or less, the development is exclusively residential, the net increase in the area of impervious surface is less than 20 percent of the area of the site; and each boundary of the site is contiguous to: sites that contain earlier development served by sanitary sewers, streets, or public water supply when the governmental unit receives the plans for the new development or parkland; or other public land, a utility right-of-way, or a watercourse. 
b.  Recreational trails if the trail is less than or equal to ten feet in width and has a continuous pervious buffer at least five feet wide on each side, disregarding interruption by streets, driveways, or other impervious surfaces crossing the trail. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2), this article applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the village manager or the manager's designee, is likely to result in runoff that exceeds the capacity of the existing drainage facilities or the level of flooding protection in a watercourse that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or public safety. 
(e)  Comity. State agencies should design and incorporate best management practices for surface water quality and stormwater quantity management for new impervious surfaces. The runoff management techniques should be the same as flood abatement plans and techniques utilized by local governments in the watershed. The lead agency preparing an environmental assessment for a federal or state project shall identify the mitigating runoff management techniques to prevent increases in peak flood flows from new impervious areas.

The runoff curve numbers in Table 3 shall be used to represent the actual pre-development condition. These post-construction peak release rates must be less than subsections 2.i. and 2.ii. below. 
2.  If the unit release rate methodology is used to design water quantity BMPs, the following applies: 
i.  For the 50-percent/two-year, 24-hour design storm, BMPs shall be designed to achieve a maximum post-development runoff release rate of 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre. 
ii.  One-percent/100-year, 24-hour design storm, BMPs shall be designed to achieve a post-development runoff release rate of five-tenths cubic feet per second per acre. 
3.  If the volumetric design procedure is used to design water quantity BMPs, the following applies: 
i.  For one-percent/100-year, 24-hour design storm, BMPs shall be designed to store runoff generated by the development during the critical time period identified in water shed. The BMPs shall discharge a volume equal to or less than the 100-year predeveloped volume determined for the development. 
ii.  For 50-percent/two-year, 24-hour design storm, BMPs shall be designed to store runoff generated by the development during the critical time period identified in water shed. The BMPs shall discharge a volume equal to or less than the two-year pre-developed volume determined for the development. 
c.  The preliminary sizing for the water quantity control shall be in accordance with the MMSD Surface Water and Storm Water Rules Guidance Manual guidelines of three-tenths acre-feet of storage per acre of proposed impervious area unless a final design is submitted. The preliminary plat shall contain sufficient area to provide this sizing. The stormwater management facilities shall be located in an outlot and not in proposed lots. 
d.  Pre-development conditions shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology. The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. However, when pre-development land cover is woodland, grass land or cropland, rather than using the respective TR-55 values, the runoff curve numbers in Table 3 shall be used.

i.  The pond slopes between the normal water level and the design high water level shall be a maximum of 4:1 (H:V). 
j.  The top width of the embankment (a berm or structure of earth built or created to retain water in a reservoir) shall be a minimum of ten feet wide. 
k.  A two-foot freeboard shall be provided around the stormwater management facilities except at the emergency overflow structure. 
l.  The design shall include an analysis of the path of the stormwater runoff that would be in excess of the 100-year recurrence event in the developed condition or in case of failure of the discharge structures. 
m.  In conjunction with the requirements for landscaping of the developments, the following restrictions shall be adhered to. When developing the landscape plan, embankments (berms) shall be kept clear of woody vegetation. In addition, woody vegetation shall be kept clear from all areas within 25 feet of the discharge structures including the emergency overflow devices and from areas inside the basin which are below the design high water level. 
n.  The proposed stormwater management practices shall not be located in a mapped regional floodplain, an area designated as regulated wetlands, or an area that is inundated in the 100-year event as determined by an engineering study. The only exceptions shall be those detention/retention basins designated by a village approved watershed or sub-watershed stormwater management plan or local stormwater management plan that is regional in nature. 
(3)  Infiltration performance standard. 
a.  Requirement. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following or to the maximum extent practicable: 
1.  Low imperviousness. For development up to 40 percent connected imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and low density residential development, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post- development infiltration volume shall be at least 90 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
2.  Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than 40 percent and up to 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as medium and high density residential, multi-family development, industrial and institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 75 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
3.  High imperviousness. For development with more than 80 percent connected imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and commercial downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration area. 
b.  Pre-development. Pre-development condition shall be the same as specified in Table 3. 
c.  Source areas.

ii.  Notwithstanding subsection (b), applicable requirements for injection wells classified under NR ch. 815 shall be followed. 
3.  Infiltration rate exemptions. Infiltration practices located in the following areas may be credited toward meeting the requirement under the following conditions, but the decision to infiltrate under these conditions is optional: 
i.  Where the infiltration rate of the soil measured at the proposed bottom of the infiltration system is less than 0.6 inches per hour using a scientifically credible field test method. 
ii.  Where the least permeable soil horizon to five feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration system using the U.S. Department of Agriculture method of soils analysis is one of the following: sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay. 
e.  Alternate use. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation or storage on green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this subsection (3). 
f.  Groundwater standards. 
1.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with NR ch. 140. However, if site specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection f.1. above, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
g.  Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial, and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance with subsection f. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil and grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales, or filter strips. 
h.  Maximum extent practicable. Where the conditions of subsections c. and d. limit or restrict the use of infiltration practices, the performance standard of subsection 38-207(e)(3) shall be met to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Protective areas performance standard. 
a.  Definition. In this section, "protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
1.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet. 
2.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a U.S. geological survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet. 
3.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
4.  For wetlands not subject to subsections a.5. or a.6. below, 50 feet. 
5.  For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds. 
6.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass; cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill material disposal sites that take on the attributes of a wetland. 
7.  In subsections 1. to 6. above, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in NR § 103.03. 
8.  Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with NR § 103.08(1m). This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that location. 
9.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
10.  Notwithstanding subsections a.1. to a.6. above, the greatest protective area width shall apply where rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands are contiguous. 
b.  Applicability. This section applies to post-construction sites located within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subparagraph (4)d. below. 
c.  Requirements. The following requirements shall be met: 
1.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the stormwater management plan shall contain a written, site-specific explanation. 
2.  Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained where no impervious surface is present. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat, and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur. 
3.  Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources, may be located in the protective area. 
d.  Exemptions. This section does not apply to any of the following: 
1.  Except as provided under NR § 151.121(5), redevelopment post- construction sites. 
2.  Infill development areas less than five acres. 
3.  Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges, and culverts. 
4.  Structures constructed in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 59.692(1v). 
(5)  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
(6)  Swale treatment for transportation facilities. 
a.  Applicability . Except as provided in subsection (d)(6)b., transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal meet all of the requirements of this section, if the swales are designed to the maximum extent practicable to do all of the following: 
i.  Be vegetated. However, where appropriate, non-vegetative measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams. 
ii.  Carry runoff through a swale for 200 feet or more in length that is designed with a flow velocity no greater than one and one-half feet per second based on a two-year, 24-hour design storm. If a swale of 200 feet in length cannot be designed with a flow velocity of one and one-half feet per second or less, then the flow velocity shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  Exemptions. The village manager or the manager's designee may, consistent with water quality standards, require other provisions of this section be met on a transportation facility with an average daily travel of vehicles greater than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of the state that the runoff directly enters is any of the following: 
i.  An outstanding resource water. 
ii.  An exceptional resource water. 
iii.  Waters listed in § 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due to nonpoint source impacts. 
iv.  Waters where targeted performance standards are developed under NR § 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code, to meet water quality standards. 
(e)  General considerations for on-site and off-site storm water management measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing runoff:

b.  Preservation of existing natural streams, channels, and drainage ways; 
c.  Minimization of new impervious surfaces; 
d.  Use of vegetated stormwater control measures to treat runoff and conveyance of stormwater in open vegetated channels; 
e.  Construction of structures that provide both quantity and quality control, with structures serving multiple sites being preferable to structures serving individual sites; and 
f.  Construction of structures that provide only quantity control, with structures serving multiple sites being preferable to structures serving individual sites. 
(f)  Location and regional treatment option. 
(1)  The BMPs may be located on-site or off-site as part of a regional stormwater device, practice or system within the same watershed. Treatment of parking lot runoff on-site with vegetated stormwater control measures adjacent to parking areas is encouraged. 
(2)  Runoff within a non-navigable drainage way that flows into a BMP, such as a wet pond, is not required to meet water quality performance standards unless designed to provide treatment. 
(3)  Except as allowed under subsection (f)(4), post-construction runoff from new development shall meet the post-construction performance standards prior to entering a navigable surface water. 
(4)  Post-construction runoff from any development within a navigable surface water that flows into a BMP is not required to meet the performance standards of this article if: 
a.  The BMP was constructed prior to the effective date of this article and the BMP either received a permit issued under Wis. Stats. ch. 30, or the BMP did not require a Wis. Stats. ch. 30 permit; and 
b.  The BMP is designed to provide runoff treatment from future upland development. 
(5)  Runoff from existing development, redevelopment and in-fill areas shall meet the post-construction performance standards in accordance with this paragraph. 
a.  To the maximum extent practicable, BMPs shall be located to treat runoff prior to discharge to navigable surface waters. 
b.  Post-construction BMPs for such runoff may be located in a navigable surface water if allowable under all other applicable federal, state and local regulations such as NR ch. 103, Wis. Adm. Code and Wis. Stats. ch. 30. 
(6)  The discharge of runoff from a BMP, such as a wet pond, or after a series of such BMPs is subject to this chapter. 
(7)  The village manager or the manager's designee may approve off-site management measures provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The village manager or the manager's designee determines that the post-construction runoff is covered by a storm water management system plan that is approved by the village and that contains management requirements consistent with the purpose and intent of this article. 
b.  The off-site facility meets all of the following conditions: 
i.  The facility is in place. 
ii.  The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the performance standards of this article. 
iii.  The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance. 
(8)  Where a regional treatment option exists such that the village manager or the manager's designee exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum on-site storm water management requirements, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount determined in negotiation with the village manager or the manager's designee. In determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the village manager or the manager's designee shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance of the regional treatment option. 
(g)  Alternate requirements. The village manager or the manager's designee may establish storm water management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this section if the village manager or the manager's designee determines that an added level of protection is needed to protect sensitive resources. 
(h)  Credit for removal of impervious surfaces. 
(1)  Same site credit. The administering authority may use the removal of pavement, covered structures or other impervious surfaces at the same property to calculate the net post construction impervious acreage and corresponding water quantity management duties. Credit may equal, but not be larger than the acreage of impervious surfaces removed when runoff release rates and detention are the best management practices utilized at the site. When best management practices with a higher order of preference are utilized in lieu of detention, equivalent credit may be granted as determined by the administering authority with the concurrence of the MMSD. Credit for reducing impervious surfaces at a site, not utilized by the development on the site, belongs to the administering authority and may be banked for allocation to other development within the watershed under subsection (h)(2). 
(2)  Dispersed site in same watershed credit. The administering authority may bank the removal of impervious surfaces, which individually must be one half acre or more, within the same watershed, where the volume, timing and peak flow of runoff will be distributed over the critical time sufficient to assure the level of protection provided by MMSD flood abatement projects will not be reduced. The administering authority may allocate banked credit to promote a policy of smart growth. The total acreage banked or allocated, or both, shall be reported, by watershed or sub-watershed, annually to the MMSD for concurrence.

    All nonmetallic mining sites subject to this chapter shall be reclaimed in conformance with the standards contained below. 
(1)  General standards. 
a.  Refuse and other solid wastes. Nonmetallic mining refuse shall be reused in accordance with a reclamation plan. Other solid wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable rules of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources adopted pursuant to Wis. Stats. chs. 289 and 291. 
b.  Area disturbed and contemporaneous reclamation. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, to minimize the area disturbed by nonmetallic mining and to provide for nonmetallic mining reclamation of portions of the nonmetallic mining site while nonmetallic mining continues on other portions of the nonmetallic mining site. 
c.  Public health, safety and welfare. All nonmetallic mining sites shall be reclaimed in a manner so as to comply with federal, state and local regulations governing public health, safety and welfare. 
d.  Habitat restoration. When the land use required by the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter requires plant, fish or wildlife habitat, it shall be restored, to the extent practicable, to a condition at least as suitable as that which existed before the lands were affected by nonmetallic mining operations. 
e.  Compliance with environmental regulations. Reclamation of nonmetallic mining sites shall comply with any other applicable federal, state and local laws including those related to environmental protection, zoning and land use control. 
1.  Surface water and wetlands protection. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall be conducted and completed in a manner that assures compliance with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water quality standards for surface waters and wetlands contained in chapters NR 102 to NR 105, Wis. Admin. Code. Before disturbing the surface of a nonmetallic mining site and removing topsoil, all necessary measures for diversion and drainage of runoff from the site to prevent pollution of waters of the state shall be installed in accordance with the reclamation plans approved pursuant to this chapter. Diverted or channelized runoff resulting from reclamation may not adversely affect neighboring properties. 
2.  Groundwater protection. 
i.  Groundwater quantity. A nonmetallic mining site shall be reclaimed in a manner that does not cause a permanent lowering of the water table that results in adverse effects on surface waters or a significant reduction in the quantity of groundwater reasonably available for future users of groundwater. 
ii.  Groundwater quality. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall be conducted in a manner which does not cause groundwater quality standards in chapter NR 140, Wis. Admin. Code to be exceeded at a point of standards application defined in that chapter. 
3.  Topsoil management. 
i.  Removal. Topsoil and topsoil substitute material shall be removed, protected and redistributed to support reclamation and site stabilization. Topsoil shall be managed as specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter in order to achieve reclamation to the approved post-mining land use. Topsoil and topsoil substitute material removal shall be performed, as required by the reclamation plan, prior to any mining activity associated with any specific phase of the mining operation. 
ii.  Volume. The operator shall obtain the volume of soil required to perform final reclamation by removal of on-site topsoil or topsoil substitute material or by obtaining topsoil or substitute material as needed to make up the volume of topsoil as specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter. 
iii.  Storage. Once removed, topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall, as required by the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter, either be used in contemporaneous reclamation or stored in an environmentally acceptable manner. The location of stockpiled topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall be chosen to protect the material from erosion or further disturbance or contamination. Runoff water shall be diverted around all locations in which topsoil or topsoil substitute material is stockpiled. 
4.  Final grading and slopes. 
i.  All areas affected by mining shall be graded in accordance with the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter to achieve a stable and safe condition consistent with the post mining land use. The reclamation plan may designate areas such as stable slopes and rock faces which do not require final grading. 
ii.  Final reclaimed slopes covered by topsoil or topsoil substitute material may not be steeper than a 3:1 horizontal to vertical incline, unless alternative requirements are approved under section 59-16, and stable slopes can be demonstrated based on site-specific engineering analysis. The engineering analysis shall show that a minimum acceptable slope stability factor is attainable at a steeper slope and that the post-mining land use specified in the reclamation plan is not adversely affected. When the slope occurs at the edge of a body of water, this approved slope shall extend vertically six feet below the lowest seasonal water level. A slope no steeper than 3:1 shall be created at a designated location or locations, depending on the size of the water body to allow for a safe exit. 
iii.  All areas in the nonmetallic mine site where topsoil or topsoil substitute material is to be reapplied shall be graded or otherwise prepared prior to topsoil or topsoil substitute material redistribution to provide the optimum adherence between the topsoil or topsoil substitute material and the underlying material. 
5.  Topsoil redistribution for reclamation. Topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall be redistributed in accordance with the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter in a manner which minimizes compaction and prevents erosion. Topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall be uniformly redistributed except where uniform redistribution is undesirable or impractical. Topsoil or topsoil substitute material redistribution may not be performed during or immediately after a precipitation event until the soils have sufficiently dried. 
6.  Revegetation and site stabilization. Except for permanent roads or similar surfaces identified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter, all surfaces affected by nonmetallic mining shall be reclaimed and stabilized by revegetation or other means. Revegetation and site stabilization shall be in accordance with the approved reclamation plan and shall be performed as soon as practicable after mining activity has permanently ceased in any part of the mine site. 
7.  Assessing completion of successful reclamation. 
i.  The criteria for assessing when reclamation is complete and, therefore, when the financial assurance may be released shall be specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter. Criteria to evaluate reclamation success shall be quantifiable. 
ii.  Compliance with the revegetation success standards in the approved reclamation plan shall be determined by: 
1)  On-site inspections by the village or its agent; 
2)  Reports presenting results obtained during reclamation evaluations including summarized data on revegetation, photo-documentation or other evidence that the criteria approved in the reclamation plan to ascertain success have been met; or 
3)  A combination of inspections and reports. 
iii.  In those cases where the post mining land use specified in the reclamation plan requires a return of the mining site to a pre-mining condition, the operator shall obtain baseline data on the existing plant community for use in the evaluation of reclamation success pursuant to this section. 
iv.  Revegetation success may be determined by: 
1)  Comparison to an appropriate reference area; 
2)  Comparison to baseline data acquired at the mining site prior to its being affected by mining; or 
3)  Comparison to an approved alternate technical standard. 
v.  Revegetation using a variety of plants indigenous to the area is favored. 
8.  Intermittent mining. Intermittent mining may be conducted provided that the possibility of intermittent cessation of operations is addressed in an operator's reclamation permit, no environmental pollution or erosion of sediments is occurring, and financial assurance for reclamation pursuant to section 59-12 is maintained covering all remaining portions of the site that have been affected by nonmetallic mining and that have not been reclaimed. 
9.  Maintenance. During the period of the site reclamation, after the operator has stated that reclamation is complete but prior to release of financial assurance, the operator shall perform any maintenance necessary to prevent erosion, sedimentation or environmental pollution, comply with the standards of this subchapter, or to meet the goals specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter.

(Ord. No. 138-O-01, § 1, 6-18-01) 
Sec. 59-12. - Financial assurance. 
(a)  Financial assurance requirements. All operators of nonmetallic mining sites in the village shall prepare and submit a proof of financial assurance that meets the following requirements: 
(1)  Notification. The regulatory authority shall provide written notification to the operator of the amount of financial assurance required under subsection (3). 
(2)  Filing. Following approval of the nonmetallic mining reclamation permit, and as a condition of the permit, the operator shall file a financial assurance with the village. The financial assurance shall provide that the operator shall faithfully perform all requirements in this chapter, an applicable reclamation ordinance and the reclamation plan. Financial assurance shall be payable exclusively to the village. In cases where one or more other regulatory authorities regulate a nonmetallic mining site, all financial assurance shall be made payable the village only if it currently has primary regulatory responsibility. 
(3)  Amount and duration of financial assurance. The amount of financial assurance shall equal as closely as possible the cost to the village of hiring a contractor to complete either final reclamation or progressive reclamation according to the approved reclamation plan. The amount of financial assurance shall be reviewed periodically by the village to assure it equals outstanding reclamation costs. Any financial assurance filed with the village shall be in an amount equal to the estimated cost for reclaiming all sites the operator has under project permits. The village may accept a lesser initial amount of financial assurance provided that the permittee initiates a process to continuously increase the amount of financial assurance until it is adequate to effect reclamation. An escrow account may be established that is based on production gross sales and serves to provide regular payments to an account that is designed to grow to the amount necessary to guarantee performance of reclamation by the expected time of final reclamation. The period of the financial assurance is dictated by the period of time required to establish the post mining land use declared and approved of in the reclamation plan. This may extend beyond the permit if required to accomplish successful and complete implementation of the reclamation plan. 
(4)  Form and management. Financial assurance shall be provided by the operator and shall be by a bond or an alternate financial assurance. Financial assurance shall be payable to the village and released upon successful completion of the reclamation measures specified in the reclamation plan. Alternate financial assurances may include, but are not limited to cash, certificates of deposits, irrevocable letters of credit, irrevocable trusts, established escrow accounts, demonstration of financial responsibility by meeting net worth requirements, or government securities. Any interest from the financial assurance shall be paid to the operator. Certificates of deposit shall be automatically renewable or other assurances shall be provided before the maturity date. Financial assurance arrangements may include, at the discretion of the village, a blend of different options for financial assurance including a lien on the property on which the nonmetallic mining site occurs or a combination of financial assurance methods. 
(5)  Multiple projects. Any operator who obtains a permit from the village for two or more nonmetallic mining sites may elect, at the time the second or subsequent site is approved, to post a single financial assurance in lieu of separate financial assurance instruments for each nonmetallic mining site. When an operator elects to post a single financial assurance in lieu of separate financial assurances for each mining site, no financial assurances previously posted on individual mining sites shall be released until the new financial assurance has been accepted by the village. 
(6)  Multiple jurisdictions. In cases where more than one regulatory authority has jurisdiction, a cooperative financial security arrangement may be developed and implemented by the regulatory authorities to avoid requiring the permittee to prove financial assurance with more than one regulatory authority for the same nonmetallic mining site. Financial assurance is required for each site and two or more sites of less than one acre by the same operator, except that governmental units are not required to obtain financial assurance. 
(7)  Certification of completion and release. 
a.  The operator shall notify the regulatory authority, by filing a notice of completion, at the time that he or she determines that reclamation of any portion of the mining site or the entire site is complete. The village shall inspect the mine site or portion thereof that was the subject of the notice of completion to determine if reclamation has been carried out in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. The village may partially release the financial assurance if it determines that compliance with a portion of the reclamation plan has been achieved and requires no waiting period. After determining that reclamation is complete the village shall issue a certificate of completion and shall release the financial assurance or appropriately reduce the financial assurance in the case of reclamation of a portion of the mining site. 
b.  The village shall make a determination of whether or not the certification in subsection a. can be made within 60 days that the request is received. 
c.  The village may make a determination under this subsection that: 
1.  Reclamation is not yet complete; 
2.  It is not possible to assess whether reclamation is complete due to weather conditions, snow cover or other relevant factors; 
3.  Reclamation is complete in a part of the mine; or 
4.  Reclamation is fully complete. 
(8)  Forfeiture. Financial assurance shall be forfeited if any of the following occur: 
a.  A permit is revoked under section 59-21 and the appeals process has been completed. 
b.  An operator ceases mining operations and fails to reclaim the site in accordance with the reclamation plan. 
(9)  Cancellation. Financial assurance shall provide that it may not be canceled by the surety or other holder or issuer except after not less than a 90-day notice to the village in writing by registered or certified mail. Not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the 90-day notice of cancellation, the operator shall deliver to the village a replacement proof of financial assurance. In the absence of this replacement financial assurance, all mining shall cease until the time it is delivered and in effect. 
(10)  Changing methods of financial assurance. The operator of a nonmetallic mining site may change from one method of financial assurance to another. This may not be done more than once a year unless required by an adjustment imposed pursuant to subsection (12). The operator shall give the village at least 60 days notice prior to changing methods of financial assurance and may not actually change methods without the written approval of the village. 
(11)  Bankruptcy notification. The operator of a nonmetallic mining site shall notify the regulatory authority by certified mail of the commencement of voluntary or involuntary proceeding under bankruptcy code, 11 U.S.C., et seq., naming the operator as debtor, within ten days of commencement of the proceeding. 
(12)  Adjustment of financial assurance. Financial assurance may be adjusted when required by the village. The village may notify the operator in writing that adjustment is necessary and the reasons for it.

State Law reference- Public safety offenses, Wis. Stats. ch. 941. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 62-51. - Sex offender residency restrictions; child safety zones. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  The village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders re-enter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools and daycare centers. The village finds and declares that, in addition to schools and daycare centers, children congregate or play in a number of public places, including public parks and other facilities for children. 
(2)  This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in Menomonee Falls from the risk that convicted sex offenders may re-offend in locations close to their residences. It is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the village's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence; and by creating child safety zones where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein access by certain sexual offenders and sexual predators to such zones shall be restricted or excluded.

ARTICLE II. - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 71-50. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings. Premises exist within the Village of Menomonee Falls for residential and nonresidential use which are, or may become in the future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance or, further, that such conditions including, but not limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of premises, infestation and existence of fire hazards constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens and inhabitants of the village. It is further found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and because of progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and that if the conditions are not curtailed and removed, these conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the conditions. Such conditions are dangerous to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the village and necessitate excessive and disproportionate public resources for infrastructure, public safety, crime prevention, fire protection and other public services. By reason of timely regulations and restrictions contained in this article, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented; the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained; the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods enhanced; and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

(e)  Interest. Interest at an annual rate shall be determined from time to time by the village board. 
(f)  Customer contributions. 
(1)  Advance contributions. 
a.  Where the village board has determined that the density of prospective customers does not warrant immediate assessment for water mains, sanitary sewer mains and storm sewer mains, or when a request is made for an extension in advance of the village's schedule for installation, the total cost of the extension will be determined and the total cost will be divided among the applicants for the extension and collected from them in advance as contributions for the extension. 
b.  In cases in which the village board has directed the preparation of a public facilities needs assessment and has enacted an ordinance that imposes impact fees to be used for such extensions, the village board may authorize the utilization of impact fees to pay for that portion of the total cost of the extension as identified in the needs assessment. 
(2)  Reimbursement. 
a.  Where contributions are advanced under (f)(1) above, the village shall impose a special assessment on all abutting properties benefited by the construction of the public improvement funded in whole or in part by the contribution so advanced. The amount of this special assessment shall be determined by the village board and charged in whole or in part and assessed against such abutting properties in such manner as the village board may determine after giving the owners thereof notice and an opportunity to be heard upon such proposed action in the manner set forth for special assessments in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0703(7) and 66.0703(8). Payment of the special assessment imposed under this subparagraph (f)(2)a may be deferred as provided hereafter. 
b.  The amounts collected pursuant to special assessments imposed against abutting properties under this subsection will be retained by the village and distributed as provided in this subparagraph (f)(2)b.

Subject to part (f)(2)b,3 below, within 90 days of the date a special assessment payment is due to be paid in full under subsection (f)(2)c below, the village shall pay to the then owner of the property making the advance contribution under paragraph (f)(1) above an amount equal to the payment due. 
2.  The village shall not be required to pay any interest on amounts paid under this subparagraph (f)(2) b. 
3.  As an alternative to the distribution method specified in (f)(2)b 1. above, the owner of the property subject to the original customer contribution may, by agreement with the village at the time of the original customer contribution, designate the persons to whom the distribution will be made, subject to the terms specified by the village in the agreement. 
c.  Subject to subparagraph (f)(2)d below, special assessments imposed upon benefited abutting properties under this paragraph (f)(2) shall be paid at such time as the first of the following events occur:

4.  The village board, by resolution, determines that the property must be served by the public improvement for which the special assessment payment has been deferred. The village board, at its sole discretion, may decide that there is sufficient need for the subject property to be served at such time as (i) the criteria used to defer the special assessment payment have been satisfied, or (ii) as a result of the need for the subject property to be connected to the public improvement for which the special assessment payment has been deferred, or (iii) as a result of the need for the additional extension of municipal services in the area to accommodate additional growth and development; or to promote the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
5.  A period of ten years has elapsed from the date the village board adopts the final resolution that levies the special assessment against the subject property. 
d.  Installment payments. The village board may adopt a resolution allowing the property owner to pay the assessment by installments. Such resolution shall set out the installment terms, including the annual interest rate on any unpaid balance. If the village board permits the assessment to be paid in installments, the assessment shall be paid within the time prescribed. The village shall thereafter collect and retain the installment payments collected from the property owner. 
e.  In the case of property which is used primarily for agricultural purposes by the property owner, not by tenants or others, the property owner may petition the village board to permit additional extension periods of five years. Such petition must show significant financial hardship to the property owner if such additional extension is not granted. If special assessment payment is deferred for an additional period under this subsection, the original amount of the assessment and any accrued interest shall be subject to interest as prescribed by the village board, and the special assessment and interest shall be a lien against the property. 
(g)  Deferring certain assessments. 
(1)  Deferred special assessments. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0715(2), the due date of any special assessment levied against property abutting on or benefited by a public improvement may be deferred on such terms and in such manner as prescribed by the village board while no use of the improvement is made in connection with the property. The special assessments must be paid within ten years of the date of the resolution making the levy, unless provision is made to pay the assessment by installments, in which case the assessment shall be paid within the time prescribed. In the case of property which is used primarily for agricultural purposes by the property owner, not by tenants or others, additional extension periods of five years may be granted by the village board upon petition being made by the property owner and upon a showing of significant financial hardship to the property owner, if such additional extension is not granted. The special assessments shall be subject to interest as prescribed by the village board, and the special assessment and interest shall be a lien against the property. 
(2)  Contingent special assessments. 
a.  The cost of installing or constructing any water main, sanitary sewer main, water and sewer laterals, in or over any property located in a CW-1 conservancy-wetlands district established under the provisions of chapter 122 may be determined by the village board and charged in whole or in part and assessed against properties in such district in such manner as the village board may determine after giving the owners thereof notice and an opportunity to be heard upon such proposed action in the manner set forth for special assessments in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0703(7)(a) and 66.0703(8). 
b.  The village board may postpone the payment without interest of any such assessment indefinitely or from time to time, until one of the following conditions shall occur: 
1.  The property is rezoned, or devoted to a use not permitted under section 122-347; or 
2.  Use of such public improvement is made in connection with the property. 
c.  If any of the conditions established under subsection (g)(2)b of this section occurs within 20 years from the making of the assessment, the special assessment postponed under this section shall become immediately due and payable and shall be collected in the manner provided for the collection of other special assessments, with interest from the date it is first due. 
(3)  The provisions of this subsection (g) do not apply to special assessments imposed under subsection (f)(2) above. 
(h)  Permits. Prior to the issuance of any building or plumbing permit, the village manager or designee shall refer the application for a permit to the village clerk-treasurer to determine if a special assessment, customer contribution or a deferred assessment is outstanding against the parcel involved.

Notwithstanding the foregoing definition, the creation of any condominium other than a conversion condominium or condominium involving a maximum of one principal building per lot or parcel shall be deemed to be a land division. A land division can be legally created or accomplished only by means of a preliminary and final plat, or a certified survey map, or, in the case of a condominium, by means of condominium instruments approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
    Minor land division means any land division resulting in less than five lots. A minor land division can be legally created or accomplished only by means of a certified survey map approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
    Plat means the map prepared, as required in division 2, article II of this chapter for the purpose of recording a subdivision.

(Code 1963, § 18.03; Ord. No. 130-O-01, § 1, 4-16-01; Ord. No. 155-O-01, § 1, 11-5-01; Ord. No. 270-O-04, § 1, 5-17-04) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12). 
Sec. 94-2. - Purpose of chapter. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the village and these regulations are designed to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to further the orderly layout and use of land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land: to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public requirements; to facilitate the further resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land. The regulations of this chapter are made with reasonable consideration, among other things, of the character of the village with a view of conserving the value of the buildings placed upon land, providing the best possible environment for human habitation, and for encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the village. 
(Code 1963, § 18.01) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Wis. Stats. § 236.45(1).

(Code 1963, § 18.11) 
Sec. 94-5. - Variances. 
    When, in the judgment of the plan commission or the village board, it would be inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter because the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits or because extraordinary hardship would result, it may waive or vary such provisions so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that in no event shall the requirement of filing and recording the plat or survey be waived. 
(Code 1963, § 18.12) 
Sec. 94-6. - Enforcement guidelines.

(Code 1963, § 18.05(5)) 
Sec. 94-100. - Environmental corridors, public sites and open spaces. 
    The protection and management of the resources found in environmental corridors is an important part of preventing serious environmental degradation. Maintenance of wetlands in natural and open space use will provide that the wetlands function in their natural capacity. This function may be wildlife habitat, a spawning ground for fish, filtration of storm water runoff, storage of flood water, or the maintenance of a highly diverse, rare or endangered plant community. Loss of significant areas of woodland may produce serious soil erosion, increased storm water runoff, loss of wildlife habitat, loss of rare or endangered plant communities, and loss of important scenic resources. The Village of Menomonee Falls is interested in having as many environmental corridors as possible protected through public ownership. These environmental corridors include, but are not limited to, the environmental corridors of the Menomonee River and its tributaries; and the Fox River (Illinois) and its tributaries, including the Tamarack Preserve. To assist in the public ownership of environmental corridors, the following provisions are established: 
(1)  Reservation of potential sites. 
a.  In the design of a plat or certified survey map, consideration shall be given to the adequate provision of and correlation with such public sites or open areas. 
b.  Where it is determined by the plan commission that a portion of the plat or certified survey map is required for such public sites or open spaces, the subdivider may be required to reserve such area for a period not to exceed three years, after which the village shall either acquire the property or release the reservation. 
(2)  Dedication of sites. 
a.  Within the corporate limits of the village, where feasible and compatible with the comprehensive plan for development of the community, the subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide for the environmental and open space needs of the village. 
b.  The amount of land to be provided shall be determined on the basis of an amount of land equal in value to $1,000.00 per lot created by the land division. The value of the land to be dedicated shall be determined by the village assessor on the basis of full and fair market value of the land. If the owner is not satisfied with such appraisal, he may appeal such determination, in which case an appraisal board consisting of one appraiser selected by the village at its own expense, one selected by the property owner at his own expense and a third selected by the two other appraisers at village expense, shall determine the value. 
(3)  Proportionate payment in lieu of dedication. A proportionate payment in lieu of dedication shall be made in accordance with section 42-94. 
(4)  Excessive street dedication . In the case of major thoroughfares lying within the plat, the subdivider may dedicate the width in excess of that required by this chapter and claim credit for the value of such land in the payment required under subsection (3). 
(5)  Determination of feasibility. The determination as to the feasibility of dedication shall be made by the village plan commission. The subdivider shall however, have the option of choosing to make payment in lieu of dedication.

Sec. 102-58. - Right of revocation. 
(a)  The board shall have the right to rescind or revoke the franchise granted upon violation by the grantee of any material obligation or requirement contained in this article, or upon the refusal to comply with any reasonable request made by the board concerning compliance with this article, after written notice by the committee to the grantee, the continuation of such violation or refusal to comply by the grantee. An accumulation of violations, which if each is taken alone would not constitute a violation of a material obligation or requirement, may be deemed a violation of a material obligation or requirement. Such written notice to the grantee shall specify precisely the manner in which the grantee is in violation with respect to the franchise.

Sec. 102-76. - Conditions and restrictions. 
(a)  A grantee shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions with regard to the operation of the system, which conditions and restrictions shall be in addition to any other subsections of this section or other sections of this Code: 
(1)  Cable, wires and other equipment in connection with such system shall only be installed and operated on or under the streets upon the poles, or in underground conduit and equipment of the existing utilities within the village where conduits exist and where space in installed conduits is available. Installation of any additional poles, conduit or other equipment for the installation of cables, wires and other overhead equipment and underground equipment in streets in connection with such system shall not be authorized and is expressly forbidden except as such additional authorization may be secured by the special permission of the board; provided, however, that in no event may installation of poles be authorized along a public street. In reaching a decision as to such additional poles or equipment, the suggestions, if any of the public utility company or companies servicing or planning to serve such area may be considered. Installation over or on private property shall be subject to prior utility easement and prior notification by mail or personal service to property owners. 
(2)  Such wires, cables and other underground or overhead equipment shall be located as may be required of telephone companies or power lines by the state public service commission. All equipment shall be grounded in the same manner as required by the electrical code of the village for electrical services. 
(3)  In case it becomes necessary for grantee to open or otherwise disturb any streets, the grantee shall first secure a permit from the director of public works of the village. The charge for restoring the premises shall be determined by the fee schedule of the village. The grantee shall pay the charge therefor to the village in advance of the work. The work of restoring the street shall be performed by the village. As an alternative regarding restoration, the village may allow the grantee to restore the street, providing prior approval is granted by the village and inspection and approval of the restoration is given by the village. 
(4)  The grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, relocate in the same street, or remove from any street, any property owned or used by the grantee when required by the village manager or designee, by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines and tracks or any other type of structures or improvements by governmental agencies when acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, or any other structures or public improvements. 
(5)  The grantee shall, upon the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its lines or disconnect or take them down to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(6)  All installations by the grantee of cables and incidental equipment shall comply in all respects with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the state, or any agency or department thereof, and of the village or any agency or department thereof, now or hereafter in effect. 
(7)  The grantee shall provide and maintain its equipment in such condition and of such quality so that none of its service will adversely affect radio and television reception. 
(8)  Installation and maintenance of equipment shall be such that standard color signals shall be transmitted with reasonable fidelity to any subscriber consistent with FCC standards. 
(9)  The grantee shall not either directly or indirectly engage in the servicing or repair of television receivers in the village, nor directly or indirectly require of any subscriber the patronage of any designated person or company engaged in such service or repair business. The foregoing shall not apply to the repair or adjustment of equipment which is part of the system of the grantee. 
(10)  The grantee shall submit to inspections by duly authorized personnel of the village and shall make available to such inspectors or duly authorized personnel its facilities and equipment. The village reserves the right to enact reasonable regulations regarding the installation and maintenance of the facilities of the grantee. 
(11)  The village shall have the right, during the life of this franchise, free of charge, where aerial construction exists, to maintain upon the poles of the grantee within the village limits wire and pole fixtures necessary for a police and fire alarm system, such wires and fixtures to be constructed and maintained to the satisfaction of the grantee and in accordance with its specifications. 
(12)  The village, in its use and maintenance of such wires and fixtures shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations of the grantee so that there may be a minimum danger of contact or conflict between the wires and fixtures of the grantee and the wires and fixtures used by the village. 
(13)  The grantee, subject to prior approval of the village manager or designee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets of the village so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee, except that at the option of the village, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the grantee. 
(14)  In all areas of the village where the cables, wires or other like facilities of public utilities are now placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground. Where both aboveground and underground installations are present, the installation may be placed either above ground or underground. In all areas of the village where cables, wires or other like facilities or public utilities are in the future placed underground, the grantee shall at such time place its cables, wires or other facilities underground. Unless other determined by the board, upon termination of its franchise by revocation, nonrenewal or any other event the grantee shall remove or cause to be removed its plant, structures and equipment. 
(15)  In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the company's removal of its equipment and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires or attachments. Such obligations shall be met by grantee within 12 months of the date of revocation, termination or other future date fixed by the board. Any property not so removed shall be deemed abandoned, and the village may dispose of such property as it sees fit. Any cost for such removal or disposal incurred by the village shall be reimbursed by the grantee. The board shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and wires, cables, attachments and poles after removal. Liability insurance and indemnity required to be provided under section 102-80 shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal. The period of removal shall end only after inspection of the removal results and upon issuance of an approval of the grantee's removal results by the board. The grantee shall provide a performance bond in an amount to be set by the board to ensure payment for such removal. The board may require the grantee to continue operating for a period of 12 months from the date of any determination to revoke or not renew. 
(16)  In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work required by the provisions of this section or any work required by village law or ordinance within the time established and to the satisfaction of the village, the village may cause such work to be done, and the grantee shall reimburse the village the costs of such work within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs. 
(17)  It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the board gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. 
(18)  The grantee may be required to interconnect its system with any other compatible broadband communications facility. Such interconnection shall be made within the time limit established by the board. The interconnection shall, at the board's discretion, be accomplished according to the method and technical standards determined by the board, in a manner consistent with the applicable FCC standards. 
(19)  The grantee shall provide a full color local origination production facility within the village limits or at such other location approved by the board. The grantee shall submit its construction plan for this studio to the board for approval. This production facility shall be made available to persons and organizations using the public, educational and government access channels on the grantee's cable system, subject to reasonable rules and regulations to be established by the Cable Access Corporation described elsewhere in this article, or by any other entity designated by the village board to operate the cable access studio and channel. The grantee shall provide reasonable technical and purchasing assistance (such as bulk discounts) to the Cable Access Corporation, and shall provide up to a maximum of $500.00 per year of maintenance on production equipment, and shall make available such additional production facilities as may be reasonably needed by the Cable Access Corporation to carry out its responsibilities. 
(20)  If the board determines not to reissue the franchise for reasons other than a material breach of the franchise or reasons unrelated to the performance of the franchise holder, or upon receipt of an application for assignment of the franchise, or upon change of de facto control, the grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the village at a fair and just market value of the system as a going concern including the franchise itself and the rights and privileges granted by the village. 
(b)  When the franchise is revoked or expires and is not renewed because of a material breach of the franchise, the grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the village at a fair and just market value, which value shall not include any value for the franchise itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted by the village. 
(c)  If the determination of fair market value cannot be negotiated or determined, such value shall be determined by an impartial arbitration procedure pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 298, wherein the grantee and the village shall each choose an arbitrator and the arbitrators chosen shall choose the third. The valuation determined by such arbitrators shall be considered the fair market value at which the system will be offered to the village. The determination of the value of the system shall be decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the village in connection with revocation or expiration including, without limitation, payment made by the village to another person or entity to operate the system for a temporary period after revocation. The cost of the arbitration procedure shall be shared equally by the village and the grantee. 
(d)  The village shall have 90 days to exercise the right of first refusal to purchase the system, such 90 days commencing on the day the fair market value of the system is determined either through negotiation or the arbitration procedure. If the village does not exercise its option to purchase, and the system is not sold to another operator who has obtained a franchise from the village in a reasonable period of time, the grantee, upon request by the village, shall promptly remove all its plant, structures and equipment; provided, however, that if the village determines not to exercise its right of first refusal it shall not unreasonably refuse to renew or grant a cable television franchise during a reasonable interim period. While transfer of the system and franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the grantee may be required to continue service to the public unless for reasons beyond the control of the grantee such operation will be economically unfeasible to the grantee. 
(Code 1963, § 23.07) 
Sec. 102-77. - Broadband cable communications service. 
(a)  The cable communications system permitted to be installed and operated under this article shall be operated in conformance with the FCC'S Technical Standards, 47 CFR 76.601 et seq.

The grantee shall continue, throughout the term of the franchise, to maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this article and consistent with the then existing state of the art. Should the board reasonably find that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the grantee shall make such improvements. 
(b)  The system shall be capable of initially delivering to subscribers a minimum of 54 channels. 
(c)  The grantee shall carry, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Milwaukee Metropolitan Area channels 4, 6, 10, 12, 18, 30, 36 and 58.

The grantee shall maintain records of complaints including action taken thereon and shall keep such records in the local business office. The grantee shall make the records available to the board upon request. In no event shall grantee remove or destroy such records without prior approval of the board. If more stringent complaint handling standards are described in the application or correspondence, such standards shall replace those provided in this section. 
(b)  In the event of the failure by the grantee to resolve complaints, the board may review complaints, other than those relating to program content. Failure of the grantee to resolve complaints may also be cause for revocation of franchise. 
(c)  In all brochures and other written material, the grantee shall state the fact that a complaint procedure has been established, and state the mailing address and telephone number of the office handling inquiries and complaints. 
(d)  When there have been similar complaints made or where there exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the committee casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the board shall have the right and authority to compel the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system, at the expense of the grantee. Such tests shall be made, and the reports of such tests shall be delivered to the village no later than 14 days after the board formally notifies the grantee. Such report shall include the following information: The nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests; what system component was tested; the equipment used and procedures employed in such testing; the results of such tests; and the method in which such complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the special test shall be recorded. 
(1)  Such tests and analyses shall be supervised by a professional engineer, not on the permanent staff of the grantee. The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the village such records with a report interpreting the result of the tests and recommending actions to be taken by the village. 
(2)  The village's right under this section shall be limited to requiring of tests, analyses and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on such complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service.

For the purpose of this section, a nonmoving violation or offense is any parking or standing of a vehicle in violation of a traffic ordinance and any violation, while the vehicle is not in motion, of any ordinance enacted pursuant to law or Wis.

Sec. 110-29. - Meters. 
(a)  Location. 
(1)  If the meter is to be installed in a building, the water service piping shall be less than 300 feet from the property line to the meter. The meter shall be installed in the basement or ground floor of the building in accordance with the discretion of the village manager or designee. Unless the village manager or designee specifically approves another location, the meter shall be located near the front wall of the building where the service enters the building. 
(2)  If the water service or fire protection piping is 300 feet or more from the property line to the meter, or if fixtures and appurtenances for the withdrawal of water are installed in open grounds free from buildings or structures, and is not metered, a meter shall be installed in a meter pit at the property line as prescribed by the village manager or designee. However, if the water service piping is continuous (non-jointed) polyethylene, the meter pit requirement shall be reviewed by the village manager or designee and may be waived. 
(b)  Installation of meter. 
(1)  Meters will be furnished and installed by the water utility and are not to be disconnected or interfered with by the consumer. 
(2)  All buildings constructed or subject to remodeling in the general location of the water meter shall afford adequate space for the installation of water meters; the repair, maintenance and servicing of the water meters or strainers; the replacement of the meters; the installation of a bypass line, if required; and any attendant appurtenant valves, fittings, piping or other devices that may be necessary for water service and metering facilities. The planimetric and profile drawing of meter room space provided shall be approved by the utility before water system connection will be permitted and be in accordance with standards on file in the utility office. 
(3)  The consumer shall also install valves before and after the meter, and shall keep these valves operational and in good working order at all times. 
(4)  The consumer is responsible for supplying and installing all piping within the building. 
(5)  All new multifamily and condominium buildings, and all commercial, industrial and public customers of the utility shall provide access via a telephone jack located within five feet of the water meter via phone lines connected directly to the local telephone service access terminate ("dial tone") of each metered tenant (or one tenant in single metered, multitenant, commercial, industrial or public customer buildings) being served to accommodate the automated meter reading equipment installed or to be installed by the utility. Access shall mean availability of outside telephone line connectivity with "dial tone" to accommodate use by the AMR system equipment. 
(6)  If a consumer wishes to have additional meters installed, the consumer shall pay for all piping, and shall also pay an amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance and depreciation of each additional meter. 
(c)  Service piping for meter settings. In installing new service piping (or changing service piping where consumers have been on a flat rate) if meters are to be set, the consumer shall, at his own expense, provide the proper connections for the meter. Where it is impossible to set meters in the basement, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the village manager or designee (who may require a horizontal run of 18 inches in such pipe line) which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service. 
(d)  Remote reading registers. Remote register water meter attachments will be installed by the utility, the cost to be borne by the utility.

The consumer shall maintain the service pipe from the curbstop to the point of use and can be billed for any water which has not passed through the meter and has been wasted by leakage of defective pipes and fixtures, as estimated by the village manager or designee. If a consumer fails to repair a leaky or broken service pipe from curbstop to point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the superintendent of the utility after notification has been served on the consumer by the superintendent, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed. 
(b)  Mains. The utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily, to make repairs, alterations or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit a sufficient delay, the utility will give notification by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of the supply. No rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for such temporary suspension of supply. 
(c)  Frozen services. See the applicable provisions of Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.89 on frozen laterals, which have been incorporated by reference in section 110-22. Following the freezing of a service, the utility shall take such steps and issue such instructions as may be necessary to prevent the refreezing of the same service. No charge will be made for rethawings if the instructions are followed. In case it is necessary to allow the water to flow to prevent its refreezing, the consumer must make proper provision for proper disposal of the water waste. For the period in which the water is allowed to run, the consumer will be billed according to his meter readings but in no event to exceed the average amount paid in the corresponding billing periods of the previous two years. A new consumer will be charged the average bill for other consumers of the same class receiving service under comparable conditions. 
(d)  Meters. Meters will be repaired by the village manager or designee, and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the utility. Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises, his agent, tenant, or of the negligence of any one of them to properly secure and protect the meter, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be injured from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the consumer or the owner of the premises.

State Law reference- Utility charges, Wis. Stats. § 66.069. 

Sec. 110-56. - Established; approval. 
    The rates, charges and fees to be paid to the village for services rendered by the water utility or in connection with the same shall be as established by the village board and approved (if required) by the state public service commission. 
Sec. 110-57. - Temporary metered supply; meter and deposits. 
(a)  An applicant for temporary water supply on a meter basis shall make and maintain a monetary deposit for each meter installed, as security for payment for use of water and for such other charges which may arise from the use of the supply. The deposit schedule shall be established and approved by the water utility superintendent. 
(b)  All monies deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a sprinkling valve, wheel or reducer, if the water is used on an unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of the water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor and the return of the wheel and reducer. 
(c)  Any equipment installed by the water utility under this section or section 110-34 is the property of the water utility. The applicant for temporary water supply under this section shall be responsible for any damage to or loss of any meter or equipment temporarily installed by the water utility. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(26), (27)) 
Sec. 110-58. - Charges for water waste due to leaks. 
    When the meter registers losses due to pipe leaks, the utility shall determine whether or not the defect in the piping or equipment was known to the consumer, or being known, he has used his best efforts to correct the condition. If the utility is satisfied that the loss occurred without the consumer's knowledge, or having known about it he has tried to correct the condition, the utility may determine as nearly as possible what is the amount of the loss by comparison with the use of the water during a like period, and the excess may be billed at the lowest step in the rates. If, however, the consumer knew of the leak and failed to give proper attention to it, the utility will bill for the total consumption shown by the meter at regular rates. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(20)) 
Sec. 110-59. - Failure to read meter. 
(a)  Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two consecutive attempts, the fact shall be plainly indicated upon the bill, the minimum charge assessed and the difference adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. 
(b)  If the meter is damaged or fails to operate for any reason, the utility will render a bill for the current period, based on an average of the last two quarters, provided that there is no particular reason why the use during that period has not been normal. In case the last two periods cannot be properly used, then the bill shall be estimated by some equitable method. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(19)) 
Sec. 110-60. - Billing procedure. 
    The billing procedure for water utility bills shall comply with Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.33 as it currently exists, or as it shall be amended from time to time. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(14)) 
Sec. 110-61. - Surreptitious use of water. 
    When the utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining his supply of water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering of the utility service being delivered to his equipment, the utility reserves the right to estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such interference. Such bill shall be payable subject to a 24-hour disconnection of service. When the utility shall have disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the utility will reconnect the consumer upon the following conditions: 
(1)  The consumer will be required to deposit with the utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the payment of the consumer bills for utility service to the utility. 
(2)  The consumer will be required to pay the utility for any and all damages to its equipment on the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering. 
(3)  The consumer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the utility against further losses. 
The provisions of Wis. Stats. §§ 98.26 and 943.20, as relating to water service, are hereby adopted and made a part of this section. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(18)) 
Sec. 110-62. - Deposit and guarantee rules. 
(a)  Property owners. A deposit may be required if the credit of consumer has not been established satisfactorily to the utility. 
(b)  Renters. Either of the following alternatives shall be used: 
(1)  A deposit may be required of all renters using water service to guarantee the payment of the water bill of the renter. 
(2)  A deposit may be required of renters where property owners have notified the utility in writing that they preferred to have the water bills paid by the renter. 
(c)  Deposit. 
(1)  The amount of deposit required may be a sum not exceeding the estimated gross bills for all water service, both billed and unbilled, which can be supplied before the utility's filed disconnect rule becomes applicable. The amount to be deposited may be a minimum of $5.00 per month for each class of water furnished. 
(2)  The deposit may be returned upon request of the customer after two years' service with payments within the prompt payment period, and, without such request, shall be refunded voluntarily by the utility after three years' service, with payments within the prompt payment period. In no case, however, will a deposit be refunded if the customer's credit standing is not satisfactory to the utility. 
(3)  A new and additional deposit may be required upon reasonable written notice of the need for such a requirement in any case where a deposit has been refunded or is found to be inadequate, or where the customer's credit standing is not satisfactory to the utility. The water service of any customer who fails to comply with these requirements may be disconnected upon five days' written notice. 
(d)  Guarantee. 
(1)  The utility may accept in lieu of a cash deposit, a contract signed by a guarantor satisfactory to the utility, whereby payment of a specified sum not exceeding the cash deposit requirements is guaranteed. The term of such contract shall be indeterminate, but it shall automatically terminate when the customer gives notice to the utility of discontinuance of service at the location covered by the guarantee agreement or six months after discontinuance of service, or at the guarantor's request upon 30 days' written notice to the utility. 
(2)  Upon termination of a guarantee contract or whenever the utility deems the same insufficient as to amount or surety, a cash deposit or a new and additional guarantee may be required upon reasonable written notice to the consumer. The water service of any customer who fails to comply with these requirements may be disconnected upon five days' written notice. 
(3)  The guarantor shall receive copies of all final disconnect notices sent to the customer whose account he has guaranteed. 
(4)  If the utility is not able to collect any bill for water service even though deposit and guarantee rules are on file, the bill may be put upon the tax roll as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0809. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(15); Ord. No. 158-O-01, § 60, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 110-63. - Reconnection charge. 
    Where service has been disconnected at the request of the customer and his account is not delinquent and he requests reconnection at the same location or some other location, a reconnection charge, payable in advance, shall be collected. A reconnection charge shall also be required from consumers whose services are disconnected because of nonpayment of bills (not including disconnection for failure to comply with deposit or guarantee rules). A consumer shall be considered as the same customer, provided that the reconnection is requested for the same location by any member of the same family, or if a place of business, by any partner or employee. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(16)) 
Sec. 110-64. - Complaint meter tests. 
    If a consumer demands that a test be made of his meter in addition to the periodic or installation test, he shall pay a test fee. If the meter is found fast in excess of two percent, the payment of the test will be refunded and the usual adjustment made in the past bills. 
(Code 1963, § 8.01(17)) 
Sec. 110-65. - Tapping charge.

Sec. 110-128. - Calculation of sewer service charge rates. 
    There is hereby imposed a charge on each sewer in this village who discharges wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the wastewater system operated by the commission and FRWPCC. Such charges for each separate entity shall be combined, and an average rate for all users in this village shall be established and calculated based upon the following formulas: 
(1)  Village user charge. There is hereby imposed a village user charge on each user. Such charge shall be levied to recover the total cost for sanitary sewer local operations and maintenance costs, as established by the village's sewer utility annual operating budget for the forthcoming year and shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  A volumetric charge shall be calculated by dividing the village user charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to sewer user effluent by the total volume of water consumed by sewer users. 
b.  A connection charge shall be calculated by dividing the village user charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to inflow and infiltration by the number of sewer connections in the village. 
(2)  Sewage treatment capital charge. There is hereby imposed a sewage treatment capital charge on each user. Such charge shall be levied to recover the sum of the total cost of the commission's capital recovery charge to the village. FRWPCC capital charges to the village, legal expenses, contribution to the village's water pollution control reserve, and any other sewer capital costs as determined by the village board as established by the village's sewer utility annual operating budget for the forthcoming year and shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  A volumetric charge shall be calculated by dividing the sewage treatment capital charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to sewer user effluent by the total volume of water consumed by sewer users. 
b.  A connection charge shall be calculated by dividing the sewage treatment capital charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to inflow and infiltration by the number of sewer connections in the village. 
(3)  Sewer treatment user charge. There is hereby imposed a sewer treatment user charge on each user. Such charge shall be levied to recover the sum of the total cost of the commission's and FRWPCC user charges billed directly to the village, as established by the village's sewer utility annual operating budget for the forthcoming year and shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  A volumetric charge shall be calculated by dividing the sewer treatment user charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to sewer user effluent by the total volume of water consumed by sewer users. 
b.  A connection charge shall be calculated by dividing the sewer treatment user charge portion of the annual budget which the village determines to be attributable to inflow and infiltration by the number of sewer connections in the village. 
c.  Sewer treatment user charges for certain classes of commercial and industrial users are billed directly to the village from the commission. This amount is passed on directly to the specific user. These users do not also receive the charges defined in subsection (3)a and (3)b of this section. Billing of these users is explained in section 110-129(5)-(9). 
(4)  Total sewage service charge. The sum total of each component established in subsections (1)-(3) of this section is added together to arrive at a total volumetric charge and a total connection charge for each sewer user. Specific calculations for billing each user class are defined within section 110-129. 
(Code 1963, § 8.02(3)) 
Sec. 110-129. - Calculation of sewer service billing charges. 
    There is hereby imposed a charge on each user in this village who discharges wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the wastewater system operated by the commission and FRWPCC. Such charges for each separate entity shall be combined, and an average rate for all users in this village shall be established as described in section 110-128(4) and levied to users based upon the classes of users described as follows: 
(1)  Residential users connection to the water utility. The residential user charge shall be based upon the volumetric charge plus a connection charge calculated as follows: Individual residential users shall be calculated by multiplying the user's volume of water consumption times the volumetric charge, plus the user's number of residential structures times the connection charge. 
(2)  Residential users not connected to the water utility. The residential charge shall be the product of the residential occupancy factor for the village, as established by the commission, times the equivalent residential unit, as established by the commission, to result in an average volume of water consumption upon which to base the volumetric charge. Individual residential user charges shall be calculated by multiplying this average volume of water consumption times the volumetric charge, plus the user's number of residential structures times the connection charge. 
(3)  Noncertified commercial users connected to the water utility. The retail noncertified commercial user charge shall be based on a volumetric charge and a connection charge calculated as follows: Individual residential user charges shall be calculated by multiplying the user's volume of water consumption times the volumetric charge, plus the user's number of residential structures times the connection charge. 
(4)  Noncertified commercial and industrial users not connected to the utility. The charge for noncertified commercial and industrial users connected to the water utility shall be the product of that user's estimated volume of discharge, as calculated using the commission's procedures and regulations, times the unit volumetric charge, plus the user's number of residential structures times the connection charge. 
(5)  Discharge certified commercial users. Each retail discharge certified commercial user charge shall be equal to each wholesale discharge certified commercial user charge submitted to the village pursuant to district rules and regulations, article XVII. 
(6)  Wastestrength certified commercial users. Each retail wastestrength certified commercial user charge shall be equal to each whole wastestrength certified commercial user charge submitted to the village pursuant to district rules and regulations, article XVII. 
(7)  Noncertified industrial users. Each retail noncertified industrial charge shall be equal to each wholesale noncertified industrial user charge submitted to the village pursuant to district rules and regulations, article XVII. 
(8)  Discharge certified industrial users. Each retail discharge certified industrial user charge shall be equal to each wholesale discharge certified industrial user charge submitted to the village pursuant to district rules and regulations, article XVII. 
(9)  Wastestrength certified industrial users. Each retail wastestrength certified industrial user charge shall be equal to each wholesale wastestrength certified industrial user charge submitted to the village pursuant to district rules and regulations, article XVII.

Sec. 110-130. - Credit for unused water. 
    If a portion of the water furnished to any premises is not discharged into the sanitary sewer system, the amount of such water will be ascertained and determined by either of the two methods set forth in this section and deducted in computing the sewer service charge, as follows: 
(1)  For users connected to the water utility. By measuring the actual amount of water not being discharged into the sewer system, by the use of a meter installed by the property owner who shall first make written application therefor and payment for connection thereof to the village manager or designee. 
(2)  For users not connected to the water utility. By measuring the actual amount of water not being discharged into the sewer system by an industrial user of water, by the use of scientific or engineering tests approved by and conducted under the direct supervision of the village manager or designee, all at the expense of the property owner, who shall first make written application therefor and payment thereof to the village manager or designee. The village may, at any time it deems necessary, order such tests to be made.

Sec. 110-131. - Billing. 
(a)  Charges as set forth in sections 110-128 and 110-129 shall be billed on a quarterly basis. Payment of such bills shall be made within ten days after mailing by the village. If such bill is not paid when due, a penalty of three percent, but not less than $0.30 shall be added thereto. 
(b)  All bills shall be payable at the office of the Village Clerk-Treasurer, Municipal Building, W156 N8480 Pilgrim Road. 
(c)  If a user fails to certify data or if a user's certification is materially inaccurate or if there has been a substantial change in data since the date of the user's last certification, the commission shall notify the user that the verification data determined by the commission pursuant to section 1701.054 of district rules and regulations, article XVII, shall be used to determine the charge due for the current billing period and all future billing periods until the user submits a new certified statement. 
(d)  Should inspection or verification by the commission reveal that any statement certified by a user is materially inaccurate, the commission shall redetermine the proper charge due and forward the new computation to the village in order that a bill for the deficiency may be sent. This deficiency billing shall be retroactive to the dates when the bills based upon the inaccurate certification were originally due and interest charges shall be applied to each deficiency as provided in subsection (a) of this section. 
(e)  All unpaid charges shall be a lien upon the property served and shall be enforced as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0821(4)(d).

State Law reference- Nonconforming uses, Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(h). 

Sec. 122-81. - Existing nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Any established use of land, a dwelling, or a building that existed lawfully before the current zoning ordinance was enacted or amended, but that does not conform with the use restrictions in the current ordinance, shall be classified as a legal nonconforming use. 
(b)  The lawful nonconforming use of a building, premises, structure, fixture, land or water may be continued, although the use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter. However: 
(1)  Only that portion of the land or water in actual use may be so continued, and the structure considered nonconforming based upon its use may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Total lifetime structural repairs or alterations to a structure that is used for, or supports a nonconforming use, shall not exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure as equalized unless the structure is permanently changed to conform to the use provisions of this chapter. 
a.  As used in this section, the phrase "assessed value of the structure" shall mean the assessed value based upon the assessment made at the time the structure became a nonconforming use. 
b.  As used in this section, the phrase "structural repairs or alterations" shall mean any change in or repair to the supporting members of a structure, such as foundations, bearing walls, columns, beams or girders; and shall not mean mere aesthetic alterations or repairs which do not affect the supporting members of a structure. 
(3)  Substitution of new equipment shall be permitted if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use. 
(c)  If such nonconforming use is discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 months, any future use of the building, premises, structure, fixture, land or water shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. When a structure is classified as legal nonconforming because of its use, and is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, the public enemy or other calamity to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current equalized value, it shall not be restored except so as to comply with the use provisions of this chapter. When such structure is damaged to the extent of less than 50 percent of its current fair market value, the repairs and alterations required for the continued use of this structure shall include floodproofing to a height two feet above the elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval flood, as determined through the use of flood profiles and accompanying hydrologic and hydraulic engineering data contained in the "Village of Menomonee Falls Flood Insurance Study," prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to those portions of the building or structure involved in such repairs or alterations. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the village manager or designee and shall consist of a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths and other factors associated with the 100-year recurrence interval flood level for the particular area. 
(Code 1963, § 17.081; Ord. No. 397, § 1, 4-7-08; Ord. No. 550-O-13, § 1, 1-21-13) 
Sec. 122-82. - Existing nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Any established structure that conforms with the use of the zoning district it is located in, and was classified as "legal conforming" prior to the adoption or amendment of this chapter, but does not conform with the lot, yard, height, parking and loading, or access provisions of the zoning district it is located in shall be classified and considered a lawful nonconforming structure. 
(b)  The lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this section may be continued although its size or location does not conform with the lot, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions of this section. Additions and structural alterations to the structure are permitted provided they comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  If a lawful nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed in part or in whole by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation, such structure may be reconstructed in such a manner that its nonconforming aspects do not exceed those existing prior to the damage or destruction, unless a larger size is required to comply with applicable State or Federal requirements. If such structure is not to be rebuilt in the exact same size, character, appearance or location as the original dwelling, such rebuilding must receive the approval of the village architectural control board.

These maps accompany and are made a part of this chapter by reference. All notations and references shown on the maps are as much a part of this chapter as though specifically described in this section. This chapter hereby incorporates any future changes or any later zoning maps that may be adopted by ordinance of the village board. A certified copy of these maps shall bear upon their face the authentication of the village president, and the village clerk-treasurer and shall be maintained in the department of community development. Copies of the zoning maps may be published and shall be available to the public in the village hall. 
(b)  Changes to the general zoning districts, subsequent to the adoption of this chapter, shall not be effective until entered and attested on the certified copy. Changes in the FW Floodway District, FF Floodfringe District, GFP General Floodplain District, or SW Shoreland-Wetland district shall not become effective until approved by the state department of natural resources (DNR) and/or the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). 
(c)  The district boundaries in all districts, except the OC-5 Commercial Service Overlay District Floodway District, FW Floodway District, FF Floodfringe District, GFP General Floodplain District, SW Shoreland-Wetland District, and the CW-1 conservancy-wetlands district, shall be construed to follow: corporate limits; U.S. public land survey lines; lot or property lines; centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, easements and railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended. 
(d)  Additional CW-1 Conservancy-Wetlands District boundaries are based upon topography established by aerial survey maps and change in flora as exhibited on aerial photographic mosaics and the boundaries of soil types, as exhibited in the SEWRPC Operational Soil Survey and are intended to represent the edge of swamps, marshes, and other lands not adequately drained or otherwise unsuited for development by reason of adverse soil conditions or extreme topography or which should be conserved in order to preserve valuable wetland resources, and shall be finally determined by the actual field conditions in each specific situation; provided, however, that along a stream or flowing watercourse such line shall not be less than 25 feet from the ordinary highwater mark of such stream or watercourse. 
(e)  Vacation of public streets and alleys shall cause the vacated land to be automatically placed in the same district as the abutting side to which the vacated land reverts. 
(f)  Annexations to or considerations with the village subsequent to February 5, 1973, shall be placed in the A-1 Agricultural District, unless the annexation ordinance temporarily places the land in another district. Within one year, the village plan commission shall evaluate and recommend a permanent classification to the village board. Annexations containing floodlands and shorelands shall be governed in the following manner: 
(1)  Annexations containing floodlands shall be governed by the provisions of the county shoreland zoning ordinance until such time that the state department of natural resources (DNR) certifies that amendments to this chapter meet the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR116. 
(2)  Annexations containing shorelands. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 59.692(7), any annexation of land after May 7, 1982, which lies within shorelands shall be governed by the provisions of the county shoreland zoning ordinance until such time that the village adopts a chapter which is at least as restrictive as the county shoreland zoning ordinance. Such regulations shall be administered and enforced by the village zoning administrator.

Sec. 122-258. - Intent. 
    This PRD district is intended to allow for greater development flexibility and greater design freedom consistent with the most advanced development techniques in use today, both in building types and in the mixing of building types and in accepted current development techniques that can be achieved under existing residential district regulations. In keeping with current economic considerations and the utilization of condominium laws, this PRD district is specifically intended to allow for increased density through greater utilization of the land and in a more efficient manner, and at a lower cost than by applying the now existing standards. By applying recently conceived, but proven, new development techniques in areas that are served by municipal sewer and water facilities, the community can again provide viable housing, consistent with the economy of the times, and thoroughly beneficial to the general welfare and economic prosperity of the village.

(b)  Referral to plan commission. The zoning administrator shall, within 30 days after receipt of the petition, determine whether the petition fulfills the requirements of this chapter. If the zoning administrator determines that the petition is complete and fulfills the requirements of this chapter, he shall refer the petition to the plan commission. If the zoning administrator determines that the petition is not complete and does not fulfill the requirements of this chapter, he shall return the petition to the applicant. When the petition meets with the zoning administrator's approval, it shall be referred to the planning consultant, the village manager or designee and other appropriate village departments for their report and recommendations. Upon completion of necessary study and investigation, the plan commission shall make its recommendation to the village board, subject to the recommendations of the architectural control board, as to the appropriateness and desirability of the proposed project with the density factor requested, the suitability of the proposed development plans, and any changes or additional conditions applicable to such plans which it may feel necessary and appropriate. 
(c)  Referral to architectural control board. Following the recommendation of the plan commission, and prior to its being received by the village board, the petition shall be referred to the architectural control board for its recommendations. 
(d)  Basis for approval. The plan commission and the architectural control board, in making their recommendations, and the village board in making its determinations, shall give consideration to and be satisfied as to the following: 
(1)  That the proposed development is consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and would not be contrary to the general welfare and economic prosperity of the village, but rather that the benefits derived utilizing the most modern residential development techniques, justifies the resultant increase in density that the PRD district requirements provide, and is in keeping with current economic and social considerations and justifies the application of the PRD district requirements. 
(2)  That such development will create an attractive and satisfying residential environment of sustained desirability and economic stability beneficial to the village. 
(3)  That the plan will result in the preservation of open land in a manner which will enhance the total environmental setting and desirability of the development, and that adequate guarantee is provided for permanent retention as "open space" of the residual open land areas resulting from the application of the regulations of this subdivision, either by private preservation as an enhancement to the development, or by dedication to the municipality as determined by the village board. 
(4)  Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservation areas shall be established in a manner acceptable to the village board and made a part of the conditions of the specific plan approval. 
(5)  If the plan commission recommends to the village board that a particular PRD petition be denied, the plan commission shall enumerate in writing its reasons for denying the petition, and such listing of reasons shall accompany its recommendation to the village board. 
(e)  Determination. The village board, after due consideration, may deny the petition, approve the petition as submitted, or approve the petition subject to additional conditions. Such approval shall be by ordinance and shall constitute approval to permit this PRD for the specific project development plan proposed, and no other. The following requirements must be met: 
(1)  The approval of the petition for a planned residential development shall be based on and include as conditions thereto, the building, site and operations plans for the development as approved, as well as all other commitments offered or required as to project value, character or other factors, pertinent to an assurance that the proposed development will be carried out basically as presented in the official submittal plan. Detailed construction and engineering plans need not necessarily be completed at the time of petition submittal, but the approval of such preliminary plans are conditioned upon the subsequent submittal to and approval by the plan commission, the architectural control board and the village board of more specific and detailed plans as the development progresses, and no building permits shall be issued prior to such plan commission approval of the final detailed plans. 
(2)  The requirements of the subdivision control chapter respecting improvements shall be complied with by the developer unless specific modifications have been recommended by the village manager or designee. The village manager or designee is encouraged to accept modifications that will not adversely affect the health and safety of the residents, recognizing that excessive engineering requirements can seriously hamper the viability of a project. The village board shall be the sole judge as to the applicability of those provisions of the subdivision control chapter or any departmentally recommended modification relating to improvements after recommendation by the plan commission and appropriate municipal departments, if a question arises concerning their applicability to the project. 
(3)  The village board shall require the developer to furnish a bond, or an irrevocable letter of credit, to guarantee the completion of the infrastructure in such amount and containing such terms as shall be required by the village board. 
(4)  After the approval of the PRD by the village board, the developer shall, at the time of application for building permits, pay a zoning fee to the village clerk-treasurer as established in subsection 42-122(c)(2). 
(f)  Changes. Any subsequent changes or additions to an approved plan shall first be submitted for recommendation to the plan commission. The plan commission, after receiving recommendations from the architectural control board, when applicable, shall make its recommendation to the village board. If, in the opinion of the plan commission, such change or addition is substantial, it shall make its recommendation to the village board. Without limitation to the village board's right to determine any other change substantial, a change in any of the following respects may be construed to be as substantial: 
(1)  An increase of more than five percent in the total number of dwelling units from that shown in the approved project plan, i.e., a change in density. 
(2)  A significant change in the size, value of type of structures from that indicated in the approved project plan. 
(3)  The addition of any principal uses not included in the approved project plan. 
(4)  A change in the basic concept of the site development which would significantly alter detrimentally the relationship of uses or open space, either within the project or as it may affect adjoining properties. 
(g)  Compliance. Upon any question as to compliance of an approved PRD with the conditions and regulations as established in this subdivision and as made specifically applicable to such development, the appropriate responsible party shall be given at least 15 days' notice to appear before the plan commission to answer such charge of noncompliance. If the plan commission finds the charge substantiated and does not receive adequate assurance that the situation will be corrected within a reasonable time, as determined by the plan commission, it shall recommend to the village board appropriate action to secure compliance or to revoke the approval of the development plan. Upon such revocation, no building permits shall be issued within the project until approval has been reinstated in whole or in part. In the case of failure to resolve the problem or to complete the development for any reason, the village board may require revision of the development plan to whatever degree is deemed necessary to achieve modified development with consideration of the specific problems of adjustment to the surrounding neighborhood consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and of the original grant of the PRD approval. 
(h)  Transferability. The original grant of a PRD approval shall be nontransferable at any time between initial approval and total completion of the project without first obtaining the written consent of the village board which may require such proof of character and financial responsibility as it deems advisable. However, individually developed lots, or groups of buildings, may be sold outright or condominiumized at any time after initial approval, if fully in accordance with the approved plan.

Sec. 122-275. - Conservation development district (CDD). 
(a)  Intent. The purpose of the CDD is to preserve natural resource areas and other large areas of open land, while permitting residential development at low densities, in an open space setting, located and designed to reduce the perceived intensity of development and provide privacy for dwellings. Specific objectives are as follows: 
(1)  To maintain and protect the village's character by preserving important landscape elements, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, hedgerows, stream corridors, wetlands, floodplains, shorelands, steep slopes, critical species habitat, and natural areas by setting them aside from development. 
(2)  To allow single-family residential development on lots with private wells and sewage systems where it can be determined that the proposed development will not adversely affect water wells in the area. 
(3)  To minimize views of new development from existing streets. 
(4)  To provide for the unified and planned development of parcels 35 acres or larger in size for clustered, low density residential uses, incorporating large areas of permanently protected common space. 
(5)  To provide for greater design flexibility in the siting of dwellings and other development features than would be permitted by the application of standard district regulations in order to minimize the disturbance of rural landscape elements, scenic quality and overall aesthetic value of the landscape. 
(6)  To create groups of dwellings with direct visual and physical access to common open space. 
(7)  To permit active and passive recreational use of common open space. 
(8)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by retaining existing vegetation and minimizing development on steep slopes. 
(9)  To permit various means for owning common open space and for protecting it from development in perpetuity. 
(10)  To create an attitude of stewardship, or caring, for the land within common open space by requiring a land management, or stewardship, plan for the common open space. 
(11)  To implement the objectives of the village's comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Principal uses. Principal uses in the CDD are as follows: 
(1)  Single-family residential uses.

(4)  All other separation distances may be reduced by 50 percent if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the plan commission that such reduced setbacks improve the plan's compliance with the cluster group design standards in subsection (g), the intent of this subdivision, and the objectives of the village comprehensive plan. 
(i)  Calculation of site capacity. 
(1)  The calculation of site capacity, or the number of dwelling units permitted in a CDD, shall be based on net developable acreage. Net developable acreage shall be determined by subtracting the acreage of lands located in a floodplain and wetland from the gross acreage of the site. When the floodplain and wetland lands overlap, the overlapping acreage shall only be counted once. 
(2)  The maximum dwelling units permitted in a CDD shall be determined by dividing the net developable acreage by three, and rounding to the nearest whole number. 
(j)  Common open space. All common open space shall be a part of a larger continuous and integrated open space system within the parcel being developed. 
(1)  Common open space shall, to the greatest extent possible, protect primary and secondary environmental corridors, isolated natural resource areas, and other significant natural and cultural resources identified in the site inventory and analysis described in subsection (l). 
(2)  Natural features shall be maintained in their natural condition, but may be modified to improve their appearance, or restore their overall condition and natural processes, as recommended by a natural resource professional.

(6)  The boundaries of common open space shall be marked by natural features, such as hedgerows, edges of woodlands, streams, or individual large trees, wherever possible. Where no such natural demarcation exists, additional plantings, fences, or other landscape features should be added to enable residents or the public to distinguish where common open space ends and private lot areas begin. Where structural demarcations are used, they shall be the minimum needed to accomplish this objective. 
(7)  Trails located within 50 feet of homes shall be identified by plantings, fences, or other landscape features. 
(8)  Common open space shall be distributed appropriately throughout the development to properly serve and enhance all dwelling units, cluster groups and other common facilities. 
(9)  Safe and convenient pedestrian access, and access for maintenance purposes, shall be provided to common open space areas. 
(k)  Landscaping. 
(1)  For the purpose of conserving the natural landscape and in recognition of the time value of existing vegetation, the preservation of existing vegetation shall always be preferred to the installation of new plant material. 
(2)  A planted buffer area at least 25 feet in width shall be established between external streets and cluster groups to provide privacy. 
(l)  Inventory and site analysis. The following steps must be taken prior to the submission of a preliminary plat under chapter 94 of the Municipal Code. 
(1)  The submittal of a general "location map", showing vegetative cover, topography, soils, and floodplain information on the subject site and all lands within 2,000 feet. 
a.  This map shall be utilized to make decisions regarding the design of the interconnected open space network. 
(2)  An "existing resources and site analyses map", showing the primary and secondary environmental corridors, isolated natural resource areas, wetlands, floodplains, location of trees having a caliper greater than 12 inches, areas containing slopes greater than 25 percent, and historic and cultural resources such as farmhouses, barns, silos, wells, stone walls, trails and hedgerows. 
a.  This map shall be utilized to make decisions regarding the areas of land to be preserved as common open space. 
(3)  After the "location map" and "existing resources and site analysis map" are submitted, the applicant shall schedule a site walk with the director of community development or designee to observe the terrain and any natural or cultural features, and coordinate areas to preserve. 
(4)  After discussing layout issues with the village planning staff, a "sketch plan" shall be submitted showing preserved open space areas, trails, lot and road layouts, that conform with the requirements of section 122-275. 
(m)  Ownership and maintenance. To ensure adequate planning for ownership, operation, and maintenance of common open space, recreation facilities, stormwater management facilities, common parking areas and driveways, private streets, and other common or community facilities, the following regulations shall apply: 
(1)  Maintenance and operation of common facilities. 
a.  A plan and narrative for the use, maintenance, and insurance of all common facilities, including provisions for funding, shall be approved by the village board prior to final plat approval. This submittal shall: 
1.  Define ownership. 
2.  Establish necessary regular and periodic operation and maintenance responsibilities. 
3.  Estimate staffing needs, insurance requirements, and other associated costs and define the means for funding the same on an ongoing basis. 
b.  Each individual lot owner within the subdivision shall have an undividable fractional ownership in the common open space contained in the final plat. In the event that the association established to own and maintain the common areas and facilities, or any successor organization thereto, fails to properly maintain all or any portion of the aforesaid common areas or facilities, the village may serve written notice upon each individual lot owner within the subdivision setting forth the manner in which the association has failed to maintain the aforesaid common areas and facilities. Such notice shall set forth the nature of corrections required and the time within which the corrections shall be made. Upon failure to comply within the time specified, the association, any successor organization, or each individual lot owner within the subdivision, shall be considered in violation of this subdivision. In this case, the village shall have the right to enter the premises and take the needed corrective actions. The costs of corrective actions by the village shall be assessed against each individual lot owner within the subdivision. 
(2)  Conservation. Common open space shall be restricted in perpetuity from further subdivision and/or land development by deed restriction, conservation easement, or other agreement.

Sec. 122-288. - C-3 planned development district. 
(a)  Declaration of intent. It is the intent of this ordinance to regulate development standards in the C-3 planned development district, and to create the specific planned development district (PDD). Specific objectives are as follows: 
(1)  Encourage development of a retail, service, office, housing, public facilities, open space, and recreational uses interwoven within a neighborhood. 
(2)  Provide employment and housing centers that have accessibility to major roads and office and industrial centers within the community. 
(3)  Encourage the location of residential and commercial uses within proximity to one another. 
(4)  Encourage the location of office and commercial structures within proximity to one another. 
(5)  Provide a single architectural scheme with appropriate landscaping and open space. 
(6)  Prohibit incongruous architectural styles, excessive buildings or excessive impervious ground coverage. 
(7)  Encourage well-integrated, well-designed office, retail, and residential developments, which provide amenities and services for employees and residents in the area. 
(8)  Encourage the creation of public spaces, such as squares, plaza, greens, boulevards, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts, and parks woven in to the pattern of the neighborhood, integrated with the stormwater management plan for the neighborhood, and dedicated to the collective social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the populace. 
(9)  Creation of neighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity. 
(10)  Provide a network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the topography. 
(11)  Provide a coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, and automotive vehicles 
(12)  Protect abutting residential districts from adverse visual and traffic impacts by encouraging development with an appearance that complements the existing development pattern. 
(13)  Encourage pedestrian connections throughout the district and adjacent areas. 
(14)  The size and location of projects within the district shall be based upon such factors as satisfactory traffic impact, satisfactory municipal services and its potential contribution to the welfare of the community. 
(b)  Components of a planned development district. 
(1)  Development size. A planned development district shall not be smaller than 20 gross acres. The planned development district shall not be more than 640 acres. 
(2)  Infrastructure and open space in a planned development district. 
a.  Streets and other infrastructure. A planned development district is designed to be pedestrian oriented. To accomplish this goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle travel speeds and encourage pedestrian activity. Interconnected network of streets with hierarchy of streets is required. Traffic calming techniques and other design components are encouraged. The integration of stormwater management features such as infiltration areas, and permeable surfacing along buildings is encouraged outside of the village rights-of-way. Streets may be smaller than in conventional development and more varied in size and form to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood. Infrastructure may be public or private, as determined in the review process. 
b.  Open space. Open space is a significant part of a planned development district. Formal and informal open spaces are required. These serve as areas for community gatherings, landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, greenbelts, boulevards, etc. Open space shall be located in each area, and each open space area shall be connected to one another by some linking open space element, for example a preserve linked by a boulevard to an elementary school playground. 
(3)  Areas within the planned development district (PDD). A PDD shall be divided into at least two types of areas, and each type of area shall have different land uses and site development regulations. A PDD may have a neighborhood center area, mixed residential area, neighborhood edge area, or a workshop area. These areas are defined as follows: 
a.  Neighborhood center area. A neighborhood center area serves as the focal point of a planned development district, containing retail, commercial, civic, and public services to meet the daily needs of community residents. A neighborhood center is pedestrian oriented, and it is designed to encourage pedestrian movement, between a mixed use residential area and a neighborhood center area. A square is required in a neighborhood center area. Retail and commercial uses should generally be located adjacent to a square. 
b.  Mixed residential area. A mixed residential area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family residential, duplex, townhouse and multi-family. A mixed residential area includes open space including small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts. A mixed residential area promotes pedestrian activity through well-designed and varied streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic. 
c.  Neighborhood edge area. A neighborhood edge area is the least dense portion of a planned development district, with larger lots and greater setbacks than the rest of the neighborhood. A neighborhood edge area is appropriate along the perimeter the neighborhood. A portion of a planned development district that adjoins existing or platted conventional suburban density housing must be designed as a neighborhood edge area. 
d.  Workshop area. A planned development district may have a workshop area. Commercial and light industrial used that are not appropriate for a neighborhood center area or a mixed residential area, but which serve the local residents may be located in workshop area. Large office use may be also be located within a workshop area. The scale and architectural conventions of a planned development district apply to a workshop area.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 420-O-08, § 2, adopted October 20, 2008, amended Ch. 122, Art. IV, Div. 6, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly said pertain to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1963, §§ 17.037(1)-17.037(3); Ord. No. 273-O-04, § 1. 7-19-04 

Sec. 122-346. - Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose, title and general provisions. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities and the requirements in § 87.30, Stats. 
(b)  Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. This division is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. This division regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the Menomonee Falls Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Menomonee Falls Department of Community Development. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
a.  Official maps based on the FIS. Waukesha County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0083G, 55133C0084G, 55133C0091G, 55133C0092G, 55133C0093G, 55133C0094G, 55133C0103G, 55133C0104G, 55133C0111G, 55133C0112G, 55133C0113G, 55133C0114G, 55133C0206G, 55133C0207G, 55133C0226G, and 55133C0227G, dated November 5, 2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated November 5, 2014, volume number 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C, and 55133CV003C; 
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
b.  Official maps based on other studies. Floodplain Study Appendix: All DNR- and FEMA-approved floodplain maps, flood profiles, floodway data tables, regional or base flood elevations and other information located in appendix B, which shall be provided to the DNR and FEMA regional offices. 
(3)  Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
b.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
c.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 122-348(d). The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 122-165 and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to section 122-62(a)(6). 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this division shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 122-348(d). 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC). 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this division shall be in compliance with the terms of this division, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, Menomonee Falls is required to comply with this division and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Stats., applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This division supersedes all the provisions of the Municipal Code enacted under § 61.35 or § 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this division, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This division is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this division imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this division, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this division or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this division. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this division are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This division does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this division create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this division. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this division be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this division shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Waukesha County Floodplain Zoning Provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by Menomonee Falls for all annexed areas until Menomonee Falls adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the Menomonee Falls zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the Menomonee Falls Department of Community Development. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(13)  General development standards. Menomonee Falls shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this division.

Sec. 122-347. - General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. 
(a)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
(1)  Except as allowed in par. (3) below, no floodplain development shall: 
a.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or 
b.  Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of sub. (3) are met. 
(3)  Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are made to this division, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with section 8.0. 
Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR. 
(b)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the department and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits.

(Ord. No. 420-O-08, § 2, 10-20-08) 
Sec. 122-352. - Shoreland-Wetland District. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 61.351 for villages or Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and Wis. Stats. §§ 87.30 and 144.26. 
(b)  Finding of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
(1)  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
(2)  Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands; 
(3)  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(4)  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat; 
(5)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
(6)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
(c)  General provisions. 
(1)  Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see section (e) of this division, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this division. 
(2)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this division and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
(3)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This division supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30 which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this division, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This division is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this division imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(4)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this division is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117, and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this division or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this division. 
(5)  Severability. Should any portion of this division be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this division shall not be affected. 
(6)  Annexed areas. The shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. The shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. 
(d)  Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District. 
(1)  Shoreland-wetland zoning maps. The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this division and are on file in the office of the Director of Community Development: 
a.  Wisconsin wetland inventory maps stamped "FINAL" on January 30, 1987. 
b.  Floodplain zoning maps titled, "Supplementary Floodplain Zoning Map" and dated February 15, 1982. 
c.  United States Geological Survey maps (most recent revision). 
d.  Zoning maps titled, "Zoning Map-Village of Menomonee Falls" dated February 15, 1982. 
e.  Wetland maps titled, "Supplementary Wetland Map" dated December 7, 1987. 
(2)  District boundaries. 
a.  The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which are located in the shoreland zone and which are shown on the supplementary wetland maps. The supplementary wetland maps are intended to accurately delineate at a larger scale wetlands of five acres or larger shown on the final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map (also adopted and made a part of this division). The final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map will prevail in case of any discrepancy in the wetland boundaries shown on the Supplementary Wetland Map as compared to the final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map. 
b.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.

Sec. 122-446. - Overall design theme. 
    The design theme for the village centre area is based on historic commercial and residential architectural styles which dominated the period as described on pages 31 through 50 of the 1990 village centre master plan. Existing buildings and structures shall be recognized as products of their own time, and are encouraged, but not obligated, to follow the overall design theme. 
(1)  Nonresidential development. The design theme varies by location. 
a.  Main Street frontage. Along the Main Street frontage, the nonresidential design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular between 1890-1920, including Italianate, Romanesque and Neoclassical, in a two-story format with office, storage or residential located over commercial. The facades of these buildings have a traditional main street storefront appearance, are relatively small in scale, have street yard and side yard setbacks of zero feet, have prominent horizontal and vertical patterns formed by regularly spaced window and door openings, detailed cornice designs, rich detailing in masonry coursing, window detailing and ornamentation, and are predominantly of brick, stone or wood. Exterior building materials are of high quality. Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple and muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than contrasts, with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary to building), location (on building), size (small) and number (few). 
b.  Appleton Avenue frontage and remainder of village centre overlay zoning district. In this area, the nonresidential design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular throughout the entire 20th century. Building styles, heights, setbacks and details vary significantly. In the desired theme, exterior building materials are of high quality. Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple and muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than contrasts, with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary to building), location (on building), size (small) and number (few).

DIVISION 3. - PID PLANNED INFILL DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 122-466. - Purpose and scope of division. 
(a)  The purpose of the PID planned infill development overlay zoning district is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed planned infill developments (PIDs), and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district. 
(b)  Generally, this PID overlay zoning district is intended to provide more incentives for redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of reinvestment. Furthermore, this PID overlay zoning district is designed to forward both aesthetic and economic objectives of the village by controlling the site design and the appearance, density or intensity of development within the PID overlay zoning district in a manner which is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and economic revitalization principles. The application of these standards will ensure longterm progress and broad participation toward these principles. 
(c)  Specifically, planned infill developments (PIDs) are intended to provide incentives for infill development and redevelopment in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk, landscaping and parking requirements. In exchange for such flexibility, the PID shall provide a much higher level of site design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments. 
(d)  PIDs have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter. In addition to such potential, PIDs also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan, landscape plan and architectural plan, and on a case-by-case basis. In order to prevent this from occurring, all PIDs are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to PIDs, in addition to the general requirements of this chapter. A public hearing process is required to review a request for a PID. This process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with that required for a conditional use, with several additional requirements. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(1)) 
Sec. 122-467. - Provision of flexible development standards. 
(a)  Permitted location. Planned infill developments (PIDs) shall be permitted with the approval of a planned infill development overlay zoning district, specific and unique to the approved PID, within the RM-1, RM-2, C-1, C-2, C-3 and P-2 zoning districts. 
(b)  Flexible development standards. The following exemptions to the development standards of the underlying zoning district may be provided with the approval of a planned infill development: 
(1)  Land use requirements. All land uses listed as permitted by right and/or conditional uses in any of the zoning districts listed in subsection (a) of this section, may be permitted within a PID. However, only such land uses which are explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the village board as part of the approved PID shall be permitted, even if such land uses are otherwise listed as a land use which is permitted by right in such underlying zoning district. Any or all land uses within the PID may be exempt from the detailed requirements listed for a specific land use in the remainder of this chapter. Requested exemptions from these use standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in application (per section 122-487(5)), and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the village board. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted. 
(2)  Density and intensity requirements. All requirements listed in this chapter for residential density and nonresidential intensity such as the maximum number of dwelling units per acre, the minimum number of square feet of site area per dwelling unit, the maximum floor area ratio (FAR), the maximum impervious surface ratio (ISR) or similar density or intensity standards used in this chapter may be waived or modified within a PID. However, only development density and intensity which is explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the village board as part of the approved PID, shall be permitted, even if such density or intensity is otherwise listed as permitted in this chapter. Requested exemptions from these density and intensity standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application (per section 487(5)), and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the village board. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted. 
(3)  Bulk requirements. All requirements listed in this chapter for bulk, such as minimum setback or maximum height, may be waived or modified within a PID. However, only development bulk which is explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the village board as part of the approved PID, shall be permitted, even if such bulk is otherwise listed as permitted in this chapter. Requested exemptions from these bulk standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application (per section 122-487(5)), and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the village board. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted. 
(4)  Landscaping requirements. All requirements listed in this chapter for landscaping may be waived or modified within a PID. However, only landscaping which is explicitly depicted on the required landscaping plan approved by the village board as part of the approved PID shall be permitted to substitute for the requirements of this chapter. Requested exemptions from these landscaping standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application (per section 122-487(5)), and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the village board. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted. 
(5)  Parking and loading requirements. All requirements listed in this chapter for parking and loading may be waived or modified within a PID. However, only parking and loading facilities which are explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the village board as part of the approved PID shall be permitted to substitute for the requirements of the base zoning district and land use, even if such parking and loading is otherwise listed as permitted in this chapter. Requested exemptions from these parking and loading standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application (per section 122-487(5)), and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the village board. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted.

(Code 1963, § 17.040(4); Ord. No. 596-O-14, §§ 33, 34, 9-2-14) 
Sec. 122-488. - Review by the zoning administrator. 
    The proposed PID planned infill development shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator in the following steps: 
(1)  First, the zoning administrator shall review the application in order to ensure that all required portions of the application are provided. Within ten days of a determination that the application is complete, the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the application is complete. 
(2)  Second, upon acknowledgment of a complete application, the zoning administrator shall undertake a review of the application which shall evaluate and comment, in writing, to the superintendent of development, on the written justification for the proposed PID provided in the application per section 122-487(10). Furthermore, such review shall evaluate the application based on the following questions: 
a.  How is the proposed PID (the development in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the village comprehensive plan, this division, and any other plan, program or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the village? 
b.  How is the proposed PID (in its specific location) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the village comprehensive plan, this division, and any other plan, program or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the village? 
c.  Does the proposed PID, in its proposed location and as depicted on the required site plan, landscaping plan and building elevations (see section 122-487(6)-(9)) result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the implementation of the provisions and policies of this division, the comprehensive plan, or any other plan, program, map or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the village or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development? 
d.  Does the proposed PID maintain the desired consistency of land uses, land use intensities and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property? 
e.  Is the proposed PID located in an area that will be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services provided by public agencies serving the subject property? 
f.  Do the potential public benefits of the proposed PID outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed PID (as identified in subsections (2)a-(2)e of this section), after taking into consideration any proposed by the applicant and any requirements recommended by the applicant to ameliorate such impacts? 
(3)  Third, a staff report shall be forwarded by the superintendent of development to the plan commission for review and use in the development of a recommendation to the village board. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(5)) 
Sec. 122-489. - Review by plan commission and architectural control board. 
    The village board shall not approve a PID planned infill development without allowing for a recommendation from the plan commission and architectural control board per the provisions of this section. 
(1)  Within 90 days after the acknowledgment of the complete application by the zoning administrator, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing. Notice of the proposed amendment and the hearing shall conform to the requirements for conditional uses. Such notice shall contain a description of the subject property and the proposed PID per section 122-487(2), (4) and (5). In addition, at least ten days before such hearing, the zoning administrator shall mail an identical notice to the applicant; to all property owners within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property as identified in section 122-487(2); and to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 300 feet of any portion of the jurisdiction of this chapter. Failure to mail such notice to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 300 feet of any lands included in the petition or to the owner of any property, except the owner of lands in the petition, shall not invalidate proceedings under this section. 
(2)  Within 60 days of the public hearing (or within an extension of such period requested by the applicant and granted by the plan commission), the plan commission shall make a written report to the village board stating its findings regarding section 122-488, and its recommendations regarding the application as a whole. Such report shall include a formal finding of facts developed and approved by the plan commission concerning the requirements of section 122-488(2)a-(2)f. 
(3)  If the plan commission fails to make a report within 60 days of the public hearing (and in the above of a plan commission-approved extension per subsection (2) of this section), then the village board may hold a public hearing within 30 days after the expiration of such 90-day period. Failure to receive such written report from the plan commission per subsection (1) of this section, shall not invalidate the proceedings or actions of the village board. If such a public hearing is necessary, the village board shall provide notice per the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. 
(4)  Within 90 days after the acknowledgment of a complete application by the zoning administrator (or within an extension of such period requested in writing by the applicant and granted by the plan commission), the architectural control board shall make a written report to the village board stating its findings regarding section 12-488, and its recommendations regarding the application as a whole. Such report shall include a formal finding that the proposed PID conforms to section 122-144, findings. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(6)) 
Sec. 122-490. - Review and action by the village board. 
    The village board shall consider the recommendation of the plan commission and architectural control board regarding the proposed planned infill development. The board may request further information and/or additional reports from the plan commission, architectural control board, the zoning administrator, and/or the applicant. The board may take final action on such PID at any time of its initial meeting, or such proceedings may be continued from time to time for further consideration. The village board may approve the PID as originally proposed, may approved the proposed PID with modifications (per the recommendations of the zoning administrator, the plan commission, the architectural control board or the village board itself), or may deny the proposed PID. If the village board wishes to make significant changes in the proposed PID, as recommended by the plan commission and/or architectural control board, then the approved process must be repeated prior to board action. Approval of the proposed PID shall be considered the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed PID. Once a PID is granted, no site plan approval, certificate of occupancy or building permit shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of the approved PID. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(7)) 
Sec. 122-491. - Effect of denial. 
    No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of such order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the zoning administrator. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(8)) 
Sec. 122-492. - Revocation of an approved planned infill development. 
    Any PID found not to be in compliance with the terms of its approval shall be considered in violation of this division and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties. A PID may be revoked for such a violation by majority vote of the village board, following the procedures outlined in sections 122-489-122-491. A public hearing shall be held by the village board prior to final action on a revocation. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(9)) 
Sec. 122-493. - Time limits on the development of planned infill development. 
    The start of construction of any and all PIDs shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval by the village board and shall be operational within 730 days of such approval. Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the PID. For the purposes of this section, the term "operational" shall be defined as the granting of a certificate of occupancy for the PID. Prior to such a revocation, the applicant may request an extension of this period. Such request shall require formal approval by the village board and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by the village board). Any portion of the PID not completed within three years of approval by the village board shall be invalid, and subsequent development of such portions (even if in full compliance with the approved PID) shall require approval of a new PID proposal. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(10)) 
Sec. 122-494. - Discontinuance of an approved planned infill development. 
    Any and all PIDs which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their PID invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to exclusively demonstrate that the subject PID was operational during this period. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(11)) 
Sec. 122-495. - Change of ownership. 
    All requirements of the approved planned infill development shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property. Modification of any PID approved per section 122-490, without approval by the village board, shall be grounds for revocation of such PID approval per section 122-492. 
(Code 1963, § 17.040(12)) 
Sec. 122-496. - Recordation of planned infill development requirements. 
    The requirements for an approved planned infill development (PID) shall be accepted and recorded in conformance with section 122-541, acceptance and recording of requirements.

Sec. 122-718. - Adjustments to required parking. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow adjustments to the minimum number of parking spaces required to avoid constructing unneeded and excessive off-street parking facilities. Reducing the amount of excess off-street parking facilities is intended to provide for more cost-efficient site development, to eliminate constructing more impervious surface than necessary, to minimize stormwater runoff, to avoid construction of unnecessarily large stormwater management facilities, and to provide more landscape areas and open space on commercial and industrial sites. To achieve these purposes, the plan commission may reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces in specific cases as described in this section. 
(b)  Adjustments. In all commercial, institutional, residential, and industrial districts, the minimum number of required parking spaces may be adjusted by the plan commission on a case-by-case basis. The petitioner for such an adjustment shall show to the satisfaction of the plan commission that adequate parking will be provided for customers, clients, visitors, and employees. The following provisions and factors shall be used as a basis to adjust parking requirements: 
(1)  Evidence that actual parking demands will be less than article requirements. The petitioner shall submit written documentation to the satisfaction of the plan commission that the operation will require less parking than the article requires. 
(2)  Availability of shared or off-site parking. The petitioner shall submit written documentation to the satisfaction of the plan commission that shared or off-site shared parking spaces are available to satisfy the parking demand. 
a.  Shared parking agreements shall provide evidence that either parking lots are large enough to accommodate multiple users or that parking spaces will be shared at certain times of the day (i.e.-A church uses parking on Sundays, when other businesses are closed). 
b.  Off-site parking lots shall not be located more than 400 feet from the principal use that it is intended to serve. 
(3)  Parking management plans. Parking management plans/operations may be used as a basis to reduce required parking. 
a.  Parking management plans may include but are not limited to: 
1.  Flexible working hours. 
2.  Bus transit. 
3.  Van/car pool. 
4.  Bicycle use. 
b.  Proposals for adjustments of parking requirements under this section shall show how the alternative transportation modes will be implemented, the permanency of such modes, extent of the program, the number of vehicles the mode will replace, and other pertinent information the may be requested by the department of community development. 
(4)  Space set aside for reduced parking. The site plan for proposed use shall be designed to provide sufficient open space on the subject site to accommodate the additional parking spaces otherwise required by this article. The open space shall be provided which, if converted to parking spaces, would provide off-street parking to meet the full requirements of this article along with all related open space requirements, stormwater management standards, and any other code regulation or adopted standards. 
(5)  Changes in occupancy or use. When the use of a building, structure, or land is changed to another use or occupant that requires more parking spaces than required for the use existing immediately prior to such change, additional parking spaces shall be constructed for the new use or occupant in the amount necessary to conform to this article. 
(6)  Changes in intensity of use. When the intensity of use of a building, structure or land is increased by an addition of employees, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement, additional parking spaces shall be constructed for such additions in the amount necessary to conform to this article.

Sec. 122-731. - Application of division provisions; necessity of standards. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this division, this division applies to commercial and industrial districts. Landscape standards are necessary to ensure that landscaping becomes an integral part of development. Landscaping also is encouraged to be used as a means of reducing stormwater runoff, both by retaining or planting vegetation and trees, and by integrating vegetated stormwater control measures into landscaped areas. 
(Code 1963, § 17.058; Ord. No. 596-O-14, § 40, 9-2-14) 
Sec. 122-732. - Site restrictions. 
(a)  For purposes of determining the number of plants necessary to meet this section of the Code, a standard greenspace calculation must be made based on this table: 
Zoning District To obtain the standard greenspace needed, multiply the gross lot area by: C-1 30% C-2 20% C-3 40% C-4 30% OC-5 30% C-6 40% I-1 15% I-2 10% I-3 20%  
(1)  At least one shade or ornamental deciduous tree, no less than 2.5? caliper for deciduous shade trees, and 2.0? caliper for deciduous ornamental trees, shall be incorporated into the design for every 1,500 square feet of standard greenspace. To assure a diversity of deciduous trees, no more than 25 percent of the required trees may be of any one deciduous tree classification. 
(b)  At least 25 percent of the standard greenspace shall be landscaped utilizing plant materials, other than maintained turf, that contribute to at-grade coverage. 
    For purposes of determining the number of plants necessary to meet the minimum 25 percent "at-grade" coverage requirement, plant types are categorized by their general size and potential mature at-grade coverage area. 
Plant Type Area of Coverage 
Provided Evergreen Tree (>8? Dia.) 75 sq. ft. Large Shrub (6-8? Dia.) 38 sq. ft. Medium Shrub (4-6? Dia.) 20 sq. ft. Small Shrub (2-4? Dia.) 12 sq. ft. Perennial (4.5? Pot) 6 sq. ft.  
*;hg;Note: Shade and ornamental trees are not considered a plant type contributing to "at-grade" coverage. 
(c)  To ensure a diversity of color, texture and year-round interest, the total number of shrub type plant materials must be comprised of a minimum 25 percent evergreens, but no more than 70 percent. 
(d)  Plants and shrubs within the landscaped vision triangle (section 122-604) shall not exceed 30 inches in height at maturity, or obstruct the view between the street and the access drives near the street yard entries and exits. 
(e)  Paved parking areas larger than 5,000 square feet shall have landscaped areas equaling not less than 15 percent of the parking area intermittently placed throughout the parking area. Landscaped areas shall consist of parking islands and perimeter screening, which can be used as stormwater management areas. Parking islands shall be placed at the end of parking rows, unless required to be sited at other locations as part of the stormwater management plan for the site. Planting strips may also be utilized to fulfill the requirements for large parking lots. 
(1)  Planting islands. Planting islands shall be a minimum of one parking stall, 180 feet in area, underlain by soil (not base course material) and other media as appropriate for stormwater management, and shall be protected by curbing, wheel stops, bollards, or other protective treatment with breaks to allow stormwater flow as appropriate. Each planting island shall contain one shade tree plus shrubs, and/or groundcover, and/or perennials to cover the entire area, or a planting plan appropriate for stormwater management functions. 
(2)  Parking lot screening. All parking lots or vehicular area shall be screened when they abut a public right-of-way. An eight-foot-wide landscape screen consisting of a mix of evergreen and deciduous shrubs, or a combination of fencing and plantings with an equivalent degree of opacity, shall be provided. The planting screen shall be located within 15 feet of the edge of pavement and may be designed to accommodate vegetated stormwater control measures. Areas that provide parking lot screening may be counted towards the required 15 percent of landscaped areas within a parking lot, when sufficient internal islands have been provided. 
(3)  Planting strips. Planting strips, which may include vegetated stormwater control measures, may be provided within parking lots. The planting strip area may contribute to the required 15 percent internal landscaping requirements. Planting strips shall be of sufficient width to sustain the vegetation placed within them or to function as stormwater control measures. Strips shall run the length of the parking row, underlain by soil and other media as appropriate for stormwater management, and shall be protected by curbs, wheel stops, or bollards with breaks to allow stormwater flow as appropriate. Planting strips shall have a planting plan appropriate for stormwater management functions, and may contain canopy trees plus shrubs, and/or groundcover, and/or perennials to cover the entire area. When determined during plan review, a walking path/sidewalk shall be designed into the planting strip, which will provide for pedestrian access to the entrance of a building. 
(f)  Landscaping shall be installed within nine months of occupancy or substantial completion of the building, whichever comes first, weather and appropriate planting seasons permitting. A planting schedule for any plantings requiring seasonal phasing shall be submitted with any request for extension under this subsection. 
(g)  For purposes of this section, environmental areas, such as wetlands and natural wooded areas, may be excluded from the lot area determination in (a) and (b), above. If the net area, after removal of the environmental area(s), is less than the minimum lot size for the respective zoning district, minimum requirements shall apply.

Stormwater drainage plans shall conform to the village stormwater management guidelines. Individual lot landscape grading, in residential developments, shall conform, as near as practicable, to the approved subdivision grading plan. 
(2)  If a difference in grade between two adjacent lots along a lot line, or wholly within a single lot, is to be no greater at any point than three feet, this difference in levels may be sloped toward or away from the lot line at a gradient of no more than one foot vertical to three feet horizontal or a retaining wall shall be constructed to retain the higher ground. An area along or near the lot line shall graded to allow stormwater drainage to flow, where practicable, unobstructed to the front and/or rear of the lot. 
(3)  If a difference in grade between two adjacent lots along a lot line, or wholly within a single lot, is to be greater than three feet at any point, the following procedure shall govern: 
a.  An area along or near the lot line shall be graded to allow stormwater drainage to flow, where practicable, unobstructed to the front and/or rear of the lot. 
b.  Sodded slopes shall not exceed a gradient of one foot vertical to three feet horizontal. 
c.  A slope protected by riprap construction may not exceed a gradient of one foot vertical to one foot horizontal. 
d.  No retaining wall shall exceed four feet in height unless it has been designed and its construction supervised by a professional engineer. A retaining wall may be stepped to achieve greater height. Each step of the wall shall be no more than four feet in height and shall be set back a minimum of three feet from the previous step. 
e.  In single-family residential developments adjustments to the yard grade around the house to accommodate grade differences within the lot can be achieved using architectural features, such as: exposed and/or larger basement windows; partial or total exposure of the basement wall with the appropriate siding treatment; lowering the garage floor. 
(4)  Berms greater than 30 inches in height, in all zoning districts, require architectural review board approval. Side slopes of berms shall not exceed a gradient of one foot vertical to three feet horizontal unless approved by the architectural review board. See section 122-669(4) fences, walls and screening devices.

Sec. 122-1009. - Landscape standards. 
(a)  Intent. 
1.  It is essential to provide a pleasing and technically sound landscaped environment in the planned development zone. 
(b)  Plan requirements. 
1.  Plans shall comply with the requirements of section 122-734. 
(c)  Maintenance requirements. 
1.  Shall comply with the requirements of the Municipal Code. 
2.  The owner(s), ownership group and/or community association shall be responsible for replacement of dead or unacceptable plant material. 
(d)  Preservation of topography. 
1.  Shall comply with section 122-735. 
(e)  Avoidance of plant monocultures. 
1.  Plant monocultures are essentially environments that have only two or three varieties of main plant materials. This approach shall be rejected for the following reasons: 
a.  It exposes the development zone to deforestation if a disease that attacks the primary plant material sweeps through the area. 
b.  It provides less diversity of plantings for birds and wildlife. 
c.  It has the visual effect of making the development too "formal" in appearance. Too much similarity in the plant materials can make the design unappealing. 
2.  Any landscaping plan (for a phase, individual property, individual building, etc.) that has more than 25 percent of any one type of species of shrub, evergreen tree, deciduous tree, annual, or perennial shall not be approved. 
(f)  Minimum planting size general. 
1.  Standards for plant size installation for those that are not indicated in subsections below. Plants specified for an approved vegetated stormwater control measure are exempt from the minimum size requirements of the subsections below. 
1)  Minimum sizes: 
i.  Shade trees: Three inch caliper, four inch preferred. 
ii.  Evergreen trees: Six foot height, eight foot preferred. 
iii.  Evergreen and deciduous shrubs: 24 inch height or spread. 
iv.  Perennials: Four inch potted material minimum, groundcover: Three inch pots or bands. 
(g)  Buffers. 
1.  Locations. 
a.  Buffers shall be provided as indicated in Table 122-1009.1.

2)  Evergreen trees: One per 50 linear feet. 
3)  Shrubs: One per four linear feet. 
4)  Other plantings: (Perennial flowers) one per one linear feet. 
c.  Plant list. The following plantings are permitted for transparent buffers. Others species may be approved by the architectural control board on a case-by-case basis. Where a transparent buffer is proposed to incorporate vegetated stormwater control measures, the architectural control board may approve a combination of plantings and fencing that achieve a comparable degree of opacity to the plantings below. 
1)  Deciduous trees: High branched, light canopied shade trees (such as: Thornless Honey Locust varieties, White Ash, Ginkgo, or similar). 
2)  Evergreen trees: (such as: Austrian and Scotch Pines, Colorado Spruce, White and Black Hills Spruce, Concolor fir, Upright Red and White cedars, or similar).

4)  Perennials: Native and or hardy flower types typical in southern Wisconsin. 
3.  Non-transparent buffers. 
a.  A non-transparent buffer is a landscape screening effect meant to "block" or visually impair the line of sight view of an object(s). 
b.  Non-transparent buffers shall have the following minimum plantings: 
1)  Deciduous trees: One per 35 linear feet. 
2)  Evergreen trees: One per 40 linear feet. 
3)  Shrubs: One per three linear feet. 
4)  Other plantings: (Perennial Flowers) one per one linear foot.

Sec. 122-1020. - Purpose, goals and intent. 
(a)  Introduction. Successful communities leverage their land use, open space, and transportation plans in a manner which creates a clear sense of scale, transition, and activity towards a hierarchy in strong and memorable community experiences. The foundation of such a hierarchy is the creation of development districts that form a positive collective identity when viewed in total. To achieve such a positive end result, each district should have a unique character defined through its land use mix and physical design. 
    Recognizing that the central portion of Main Street in their community lacked such a recognizable character and had regulations which might only compound this challenge, the Village of Menomonee Falls prepared a vision for the Main Street redevelopment area generally bounded on each side by the Main Street/Highway 41/45 interchange and the Main Street/Pilgrim intersection. This vision was prepared through a process infused with public input and calls for a collection of land uses positioned to provide a more sustaining mix of uses and activities than current development generally affords. This area, now known as the Main Street redevelopment district, intends a rich tapestry of neighborhood identities encouraging new development and redevelopment. 
(1)  The community also recognizes that a key area along the freeway was lacking in a recognizable character and facing future changes to land use as older industrial structures become obsolete. The Village of Menomonee Falls prepared the northeast area neighborhood plan, which was adopted as a component of the comprehensive plan for the village. This vision was prepared through a process with public input and calls for a collection of land uses positioned to provide a sustaining mix of uses along the 41/45 corridor. This area is commonly referred to as the Richfield Way Extension. 
(2)  In order to implement these visions, the design standards affecting development are intended to be consistent with the vision behind their intent. To accomplish this goal, the Main Street redevelopment district has been subdivided into a series of development sub-districts and the development restrictions that will be necessary to achieve their collective individuality. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to define the character of new development within each sub-district and is intended to help create new development patterns that are consistent with the vision and recommendations of the Village of Menomonee Falls Comprehensive Plan and Main Street redevelopment plan. These guidelines have been written to define specific standards necessary towards the creation of a mixed use, streetscape-oriented development. They have been carefully designed to allow enough flexibility for creative building solutions, while being prescriptive in areas necessary to preserve consistency the Main Street district requires. 
(c)  Goals. 
(1)  Encourage private investment in residential, commercial and office developments; 
(2)  Eliminate blighting influences; 
(3)  Diversify the local economy through tax base and job creation; 
(4)  Create a well-planned, safe and healthful area; 
(5)  Provide cleared and fully improved sites for mixed use projects to include residential, commercial and office development; 
(6)  Improve traffic and pedestrian circulation linking new development with established adjacent residential neighborhoods; 
(7)  Improve stormwater facilities and integrate stormwater management into landscaped areas; 
(8)  Provide opportunities for multiple types of upscale housing. 
(d)  Intent. 
(1)  To provide a comfortable and attractive environment for pedestrians which include such things as buildings framing public space, street trees, lighting and awnings that will attract pedestrians and public activities; 
(2)  To construct buildings close to the sidewalk and street; 
(3)  To construct continuous building frontage along block faces except where it is desirable to provide for pedestrian and auto pass-throughs to parking at mid-block; 
(4)  To provide shared parking both on-street and in the center of blocks that will benefit the entire district; 
(5)  To contribute to the definition and use of public parks and plazas; 
(6)  To design streets and buildings that will create a safe environment.

APPENDIX B - SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING ORDINANCE[1] 
1.0 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND TITLE 
1.1 Statutory authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 61.351 for villages or Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and Wis. Stats. §§ 87.30 and 144.26. 
1.2 Finding of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
(1) Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
(2) Maintain the storm[water] and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands; 
(3) Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(4) Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat; 
(5) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
(6) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS 
2.1 Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see § 4.0 of this ordinance, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this ordinance. 
2.2 Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
2.3 Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
2.31 This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30 which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.32 This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
2.4 Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this ordinance is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117, and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
2.5 Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
2.6 Annexed areas. The shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. The shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. 
3.0 SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING DISTRICT 
3.1 Shoreland-wetland zoning maps. The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this ordinance and are on file in the office of the municipal clerk: 
(1) Wisconsin wetland inventory maps stamped "FINAL" on January 30, 1987. 
(2) Floodplain zoning maps titled, "Supplementary Floodplain Zoning Map" and dated February 15, 1982. 
(3) United States Geological Survey maps (most recent revision). 
(4) Zoning maps titled, "Zoning Map-Village of Menomonee Falls" dated February 15, 1982.

3.2 District boundaries. 
3.21 The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the municipality which are located in the shoreland zone and which are shown on the supplementary wetland maps. The supplementary wetland maps are intended to accurately delineate at a larger scale wetlands of five acres or larger shown on the final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map (also adopted and made a part of this ordinance). The final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map will prevail in case of any discrepancy in the wetland boundaries shown on the Supplementary Wetland Map as compared to the final Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map. 
3.22 Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
3.23 When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error. If department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in §§ 3.24 and 3.25, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
3.24 Filled wetlands.

8.0 DEFINITIONS 
8.1 For the purpose of administering and enforcing this ordinance, the terms or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows: Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the singular number include the plural number; words in the plural number include the singular number.

8.2 The following terms used in this ordinance mean: 
(1)  "Accessory structure or use" means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use.

(9)  "Fixed houseboat" as defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121(1) means a structure not actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary high-water mark of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to the bed of the waterway.
