PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Portage, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through December 12, 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Marie A. Moe, CMC, City Clerk, W. Andrew Voigt, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

b.  Responsibility for interpretation and application of plan. The mayor, city administrator or his/her designee shall be responsible for the interpretation and application of the plan in relation to pay issues not specifically addressed by this plan, using the principles set forth herein as a policy guide. 
(4)  Pay rate adjustments.

Employees whose base pay has reached the maximum for their classification will be eligible to receive a performance bonus in the same manner as prescribed for merit adjustments. However, a performance bonus shall be treated as a "one-time" payment and will not increase the employee's base pay rate. 
(5)  Administration and plan maintenance. The administration and maintenance of the pay plan, as set forth herein, shall be the responsibility of the mayor, city administrator or his/her designee. 
a.  Wage and salary survey. At the mayor's or his/her designee's direction, the city shall conduct a survey of comparable municipal employers for the purpose of evaluating the competitive position of the city's salary schedule. To the extent possible such city employee conducting the survey shall not be a potential recipient of compensation adjustment. A comprehensive evaluation of the city's pay plan will be conducted every three to five years or sooner at mayor's discretion. 
b.  Pay plan adjustments. Whenever the results of annual salary surveys and/or comprehensive plan evaluations suggest that the city's established pay plan no longer meets the objectives set forth herein, the mayor's office or his/her designee shall submit recommended revisions to the human resources committee. Implementation of a revised salary schedule or a revised pay plan shall be upon human resources recommendation and subject to approval by the common council. 
c.  Administrative documentation. The city clerk shall be responsible for maintaining necessary administrative and supporting documentations required for plan implementation and continued operation.

(a)  The city, by resolution of its common council, may levy and collect special assessments upon property in a limited and determinable area for special benefits conferred upon such property by any municipal work or improvement and may provide for the payment of all or any part of the cost of the work or improvement. In addition to other methods approved by law, special assessments for any public work or improvement or any special charge for current services may be levied in accordance with the provisions of this article.

Sec. 2-492. - Resolution and report required. 
(a)  Public improvements carried out pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0701 et seq., and this article shall be initiated by a preliminary resolution presented to the common council by the director of public works, which resolution shall declare the common council's intention to exercise its assessment powers for such municipal purpose, describe the same, the limits of the proposed assessment district, the number of installments in which special assessment may be paid or that the number of installments will be determined at hearing thereon, and direct the director of public works to make a report thereon. After adoption of such preliminary resolution by the common council, copies thereof shall be forwarded by the city clerk to the director of public works. Upon receipt of copy of such preliminary resolution, the director of public works or consulting city engineer shall prepare the report thereon.

Under any circumstances the assessment will not be less than the long way of such lot.

(b)  Waiver of notice, assessments under. The common council may, without any notice of hearing, levy and assess the whole or any part of the cost of any municipal work or whole or any part of the cost of any municipal work or improvement as a special assessment upon the property specifically benefited thereby whenever notice and hearing thereon is in writing waived by all the owners of property affected by such special assessment. In such cases, the procedure shall be the same as hereinbefore provided excepting for the noticing and holding of public hearing.

This provision is in no way intended to prohibit the prepayment of the balance owning at any time on principal together with interest to date of payment only. 
(b)  Assessment a lien. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0717, any special assessment levied under this article shall be a lien on the property against which it is levied on behalf of the city.

(k)  Revocation of permits. 
(1)  The department of inspection may revoke any building, plumbing, HVAC or electrical permit, certificate of occupancy, or approval issued under the regulations of this article and articles III through VI of this chapter and may stop construction or use of approved new materials, equipment, methods of construction, devices or appliances for any of the following reasons:

Lights shall be kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night. 
(c)  Street repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one day after said building reaches its destination, report that fact to the department of inspection, inspect the streets, highways and curbs and gutters over which said building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the failure of the said permittee to do so within ten days thereafter to the satisfaction of the director of public works, the city shall repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his bond responsible for the payment of same. 
(d)  Conformance with Code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the city and to establish it upon a location within the said city until the department of inspection has made an investigation of such building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from such investigation that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of such construction that it will meet the requirements of the city building code as set out in this article and articles III through VI of this chapter in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the department of inspection, and it shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this article and articles III through VII of this chapter and that, when the same are completed, the building as such will so comply with this article and articles III through VI of this chapter. In the event a building is to be moved from the city to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed alterations to such building may be disregarded.

(Code 1990, § 15-2-6) 
Sec. 10-227. - Control or erosion and pollutants during land disturbance and development. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to the following sites of land development or land disturbing activities: 
(1)  Those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction of houses or commercial, industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys. 
(2)  Those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of houses of commercial, industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys. 
(3)  Those involving grading, removal of protective ground cover or vegetation, excavation, land filling or other land disturbing activity affecting a surface area of 4,000 square feet or more. 
(4)  Those involving excavation or filling or a combination of excavation and filling affecting 400 cubic yards or more of dirt, sand or other excavation or fill material. 
(5)  Those involving street, highway, road or bridge construction, enlargement, relocation or reconstruction. 
(6)  Those involving the laying, repairing, replacing or enlarging of an underground pipe or facility for a distance of 300 feet or more. 
The above applicability criteria are specifically stated in 1983 Wisconsin Act 416 for inclusion in this article. Utility companies responsible for energy repair work should enter into a "memorandum of agreement" with the department of inspection clearly stating their responsibilities if their activities may be included under any of the above applicability criteria. 
(b)  Erosion and other pollutant control requirements. The following requirements shall be met on all sites described in subsection (a) of this section: 
(1)  Site dewatering. 
a.  Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, up-slope chambers, hydrocyclones, swirl concentrators, or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate. If the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than 100 microns during dewatering operations, then no control is needed before discharge, except as determined by the city. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels. 
b.  There are several ways to meet the particle size performance objective of subsection (b)(1)a of this section, depending on the pumping rate. As an example, if the pumping rate is very low (one gallon/minute), then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe (about eight inches in diameter for one gallon/minute) several feet along would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of 100 micron, and larger, particles. As the pumping rate increases, then the "device" must be enlarged. At a moderate (100 gallons/minute) pumping rate, a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe, or concrete pipe section, or other small "tank" (about 41/2 feet across for a 100 gallons/minute pumping rate) several feet tall would be adequate. With these pipe sections or small tanks, inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence. With very large pumping rates (10,000 gallons/minute), sediment basins (about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10,000 gallons/minute) at least three feet in depth with a simple (but adequately sized) pipe outlet would be needed. More sophisticated control devices (such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones) could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above, but they would not be required. 
c.  The performance standard of 100 micron maximum particles in the dewatering water at the maximum pumping rate significantly reduces the liability of the contractor when compared to a standard of "no visible particulate matter." If a properly sized device is correctly used, based on the 100 micron particle size performance standard, then discharges of visible particular matter would not constitute a violation. It is not possible to design a control device that would ensure "no visible particular matter" discharges. This 100 micron standard is intended to significantly reduce sedimentation problems in downstream drainage systems and in the receiving waters that are caused by large particles. "Visible particulate matter" will probably still occur in water meeting this standard, as most turbidity effects are caused by very small particles that usually do not cause as severe a sedimentation problem as larger particles. This 100 micron particle size performance standard was therefore selected to be easily met and enforced, and to reduce sedimentation problems. A "no visible particulate matter" standard in contrast could not be met easily or cheaply, violations would frequently occur, and inspectors would have to make frequent site visits and require frequent control device changes. In addition, particle size measurements would not be required to prove compliance with the 100 micron performance standard. Only the proper use of a device designed to meet this particle size criteria is needed. However, if a contractor or site engineer feels that the dewatering water does not contain any particles larger than 100 microns, no control device would be needed if optional frequent particle size analyses confirm that fact. In most cases, the use of the simple control devices described previously would be less expensive and less bothersome than performing frequent particle size analyses. 
(2)  Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system. 
(3)  Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
(4)  Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale, filter fabric, or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards and specifications. 
(5)  Site erosion control. The following criteria apply only to land development or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site: 
a.  Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described below in subsection (b)(5)c.3 of this section. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 0.5 feet/second across the disturbed area for the set of one year design storms. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels. Soil and conservation service guidelines for allowable velocities in different types of channels should be followed. 
b.  All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time. 
c.  Runoff from the entire area disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by the meeting either of the following: 
1.  All disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more days shall be stabilized by seeding or sodding (only available prior to September 15) or by mulching or covering, or other equivalent control measure. 
2.  For sites with ten acres or more disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Seeding or sodding prior to May 1 shall require written approval from the director public works for sites with ten acres or more. Each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin shall be designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size, based on the set of one year design storms having durations from 0.5 to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water. 
3.  For sites with less than ten acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. 
d.  Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material should not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for more than seven days, they shall be stabilized by fabric fences, straw bales, vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than seven days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile. If the piles are in existence for extended periods, the fences or bales may need to be replaced. In-street utility repair or construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control if exposed for more than seven days, and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bales or other appropriate filtering barriers.

(Code 1990, § 6-3-1(d)) 
Sec. 10-305. - General requirements. 
    The location, design and construction of driveways shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  General design. Private driveways shall be of such width and so located that all of such driveways and their appurtenances are within the limits of the frontage abutting the street of the property served. Driveways shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street intersection area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the street right-of-way required for effective traffic control or for street signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it shall have adequate sight distance along the street. Driveway approaches shall be at least ten feet apart except by special permission from the common council, or committee thereof, and driveways shall in all cases be placed wherever possible as not to interfere with utilities in place. 
(2)  Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property fronting on a street shall be one, except where deemed necessary and feasible by the city engineer, for reasonable and adequate service to the property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the street. 
(3)  Island area. The island area in the street right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way shall constitute a restricted area and may be filled in and graded only as provided in subsection (7) of this section. 
(4)  Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with street cross sections shall slope downward and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage flowing onto the street roadbed. 
(5)  Culverts. Driveways shall not obstruct or impair drainage in street ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where required, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the street and shall not be less than the equivalent of a 12-inch diameter pipe. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall not be less than ten feet except as such restricted area is permitted to be filled in pursuant to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section. 
(6)  Reconstruction of sidewalks and curb and gutter. When the construction of a driveway requires the removal of a curb or gutter the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway surface shall be connected with the highway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway construction shall include the replacement of such sidewalk areas which are inadequate or which are or may be damaged by means of vehicle travel across the sidewalk. All driveway entrances and approaches which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in chapter 66, article II, insofar as such requirements are applicable, including thickness requirements. Standard thickness of driveway approaches will be six inches thick. 
(7)  Restricted areas. The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in and graded only when the following requirements are complied with: 
a.  The filling or draining shall be to grades approved by the director of public works and, except where highway drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the street roadbed in a suitable manner. 
b.  Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same size and of equivalent acceptable material as the culvert under the driveway. Intermediate manholes adequate for cleanout purposes may be required where the total culvert length is excessive. 
c.  Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the street roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the street roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts as may be required by the superintendent of public works. 
(8)  Relocation of utilities. Any costs of relocating utilities shall be the responsibility of the property owner with approval of the common council necessary before any utility may be relocated and the driveway installed. 
(9)  Construction across sidewalks. All driveway entrances and approaches which are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in chapter 66, article II, insofar as such requirements are applicable, including thickness requirements. 
(10)  Variances. Any of the above requirements may be waived or modified by the plan commission in such instances where the peculiar nature of the property or the design of the street may make the rigid adherence to the above requirements impossible or impractical. 
(Code 1990, § 6-3-2(a); Ord. No. 14-020, § II, 11-13-2014; Ord. No. 14-022, 12-11-2014)

(1)  Width of drive. No part of a private driveway located within the dedicated area of a public street shall, except as hereinafter provided, have a width greater than 30 feet measured at right angles to the centerline of said driveway, except as increased by permissible radii. In instances where the nature of the commercial or industrial activity or the physical characteristics of the land would require a driveway of greater width than herein specified, the plan commission in its discretion may permit a driveway of additional width during site plan consideration upon recommendation by the city engineer. 
(2)  Angular placement of driveway. The angle between the centerline of the driveway and the curbline shall not be less than 450. 
(3)  Island areas. Where the public sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, an island of a minimum length of six feet measured along the curbline shall be placed between each entrance to a city street. The curb shall be left intact for the length of this island. Where the public sidewalk is remote from the curb, an island of a minimum length of ten feet measured along the right-of-way line shall be maintained along each entrance to the city street. All flares shall be tangent to the curbline. A curb length of not less than three feet shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each property line to serve as an island area in the event an adjoining property owner applies for a driveway permit to serve his property.

Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. However, the city believes that resolution of the complaint will be more promptly achieved if the city is able to provide a remedy before the complaint is brought to an external organization.

(e)  Alcohol license demerit point system. 
(1)  Purpose. In addition to the regulations found in Chapter 125 of the Wisconsin Statutes and this chapter of the City of Portage Ordinances, the following point system is hereby established to provide a guide for the legislative and regulatory committee of the common council in the suspension or revocation of alcohol licenses. This system is intended to identify habitually troublesome alcohol license holders who repeatedly violate Wisconsin Statutes and/or city ordinances or those license holders who repeatedly permit such violations and to assist the Legislative and Regulatory Committee and the common council in taking consistent action in matters involving alcohol licenses. 
(2)  Point schedule. The following is a list of demerit points for each type of listed violation. 
Type of Violation      Point Value 
Sale of alcohol beverages without license or permit ..... 100 
Unauthorized transfer/use of license ..... 75 
Sale of alcohol beverages to under aged person ..... 50 
Sale of alcohol beverages to intoxicated person ..... 35 
Under aged person on premises ..... 35 
Intoxicated bartender ..... 50 
After hours consumption ..... 35 
Refusal to allow police to search premises or refusal to cooperate with lawful police investigation ..... 75 
Licensee, agent or licensed operator to be on premises at all times ..... 35 
Agent responsibility violations-for example, lack of control of business holding the license, lack of control of premises, etc. ..... 35 
Person(s) on premises after closing hours ..... 25 
No carry-out, restricted to appropriate hours ..... 10 
Permit person to leave licensed premises with open alcohol beverage ..... 10 
Failure to post license ..... 50

Orderly conduct required ..... 35

All Other Violations of Wisconsin Statutes Section 125 or ordinances of the City of Portage ..... 10-75 
Any points assessed for the above violations shall double if the violation results in serious bodily injury to or the death of any person. 
Any warning issued by the Portage Police Department for any of the above violations shall be counted as one-half the points specified for that violation. 
(3)  Calculating Violations. In determining the accumulated demerit points against a license, the city shall use the date each violation was committed as the basis for the determination. In addition, the violation must occur on the licensed premises or be directly related to the use of the licensed premises. 
a.  Demerit points shall be assessed after entry of a judgment of conviction in a federal, state or municipal court for violation of any statute or ordinance provision listed under the types of violations in subsection (e)(2) above. The legislative and regulatory committee may take notice of any such convictions without the need for further evidence to establish the violation. 
b.  Alternatively, demerit points may be assessed by the legislative and regulatory committee upon proof of a violation or violations set forth in subsection (e)(2) above at a hearing before that body. At that hearing, the city shall have the burden of proving any violation by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence. 
c.  The Legislative and regulatory committee shall have the exclusive authority to assign a point value for any violation for which the point value is not specified above. 
The designation of a point value for a particular violation shall be made at the same hearing that the committee takes up the possible suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of an alcohol license. 
(4)  Notice and hearing. The legislative and regulatory committee shall provide notice of and conduct any hearing which could result in the suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of any alcohol license pursuant to Wisconsin Statute Section 125.12 or its' successors and shall use subsections (a) through (c) below as a guide to determine the appropriate sanction, if any, for the license holder following such hearing. 
a.  For demerit points accumulated in the current and most recently completed license year of at least 100, but less than 150, suspension of the license for a period of three to ten days. 
b.  For demerit points accumulated in the current and most recently completed license year of at least 150, but less than 200, suspension of the license for a period of 10 to 90 days. 
c.  For demerit points accumulated in the current and most recently completed license year of 200 or more, revocation or nonrenewal of the license. 
(5)  Scope of subsection 14-60(e). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to conflict with, abridge or modify the rights or procedures established for the suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of alcohol licenses established by the Wisconsin Statutes and does not restrict the city, or any other party, from seeking suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of an alcohol license regardless of the total number of demerit points assessed against a license. 
(6)  Transfer/sale of licensed business. Upon transfer or sale of any licensed business, all accumulated demerit points shall be cancelled unless any of the following apply: 
a.  The new licensee is related to the former licensee by blood, adoption, marriage or is his/her domestic partner. 
b.  The new licensee held an ownership interest in the previous licensed business, real estate or equipment. 
c.  The former licensee retains an ownership interest in the business, real estate or equipment used by the business. 
For the purposes of this section, an "ownership interest" is defined to mean that a person, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity either owns all or part of or controls directly or indirectly, the licensed business. This is not intended to include a relationship that is strictly related to a security interest or a vendor's interest under a land contract unless otherwise maintaining an ownership interest. It is presumed that control of or ownership of any part of a legal entity that has an ownership interest in a business is an "ownership interest" under this subsection. 
If any of the subsections 14-60(e)(6)a.-c. apply, the new licensee will inherit the demerit points previously assessed and be subject to all of the applicable provisions of this section.

(1)  The licensee or agent of a corporate licensee shall notify the police department at least 48 hours in advance of the date of any event at which underage persons will be present on the licensed premises.

All notices shall be filed with the police department during normal working hours (8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) and shall be given on forms prescribed by the police department. After a nonalcohol event notice has been given, the licensee may cancel an event only by giving like notice to the police department in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Regardless of the date given, all notices shall expire and be deemed cancelled no later than the date of expiration or revocation of the applicable retail Class "B" or "Class B" license. 
(2)  During the period of any nonalcohol event, a notice card prescribed by the police department shall be posted at all public entrances to the licensed premises notifying the general public that no alcohol beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises during the event. 
(3)  Once a nonalcohol event has commenced, no alcohol beverages may be consumed, sold or given away on or carried into the licensed premises until the next day following the closing hours of the licensed premises. 
(4)  During the period of any nonalcohol event, alcohol beverages shall be stored in a locked portion of the licensed premises in a secure place out of the sight and physical reach of any patron present and shall be under the direct and immediate control and supervision of the licensee or a licensed bartender in the employ of the licensee. All beer taps and automatic dispensers of alcohol beverages ("speed guns") shall be either disconnected, disabled or made inoperable.

The police department shall conduct an investigation of the applicant including, but not limited to, requesting information from the state, surrounding municipalities, and/or any community where the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. If the chief of police recommends denial, the chief of police shall provide, in writing, the reasons for such recommendation. If the chief of police recommends denial, the legislative and regulatory committee shall have the right to review the chief's decision and make a recommendation to the common council. 
(Code 1990, § 7-2-31)

State Law reference- Provisional License, Wis. Stats. § 125.17(5). 
Sec. 14-95. - Issuance or denial of operator's licenses. 
(a)  After the common council approves the granting of an operator's license, the city clerk shall issue the license. 
(b)  (1)  If the application is denied by the common council, the city clerk shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the denial, the reasons therefor, and of the opportunity to request a reconsideration of the application by the common council in either a closed or open session. Such notice must be sent by certified mail to, or served upon, the applicant at least ten days prior to the common council's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration hearing, the applicant may present evidence and testimony as to why the license should be granted. 
(2)  If, upon reconsideration, the common council again denies the application, the city clerk shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to the circuit court pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 125.12(2)(d) for review. 
(c)  Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on the following: 
(1)  The common council will not discriminate against someone based upon an arrest and conviction record except the common council shall have the right to refuse to license any individual who has been convicted of any felony, misdemeanor or any other offense, the circumstances of which substantially relate to the circumstance of the licensed activity as an operator; 
(2)  The financial responsibility of the applicant; 
(3)  The appropriateness of the location and the premises where the licensed business is to be conducted; and 
(4)  Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. 
(d)  An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, the phrase "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the common council, the common council reserves the right to consider the severity, and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the common council, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one year or more.

DIVISION 4. - OVERGROWN LAWN AND GRASSES[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-015, adopted Oct. 10, 2013, repealed former Div. 4, §§ 26-101-26-108, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Div. 4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1990, §§ 8-1-6, 8-1-7. 

Sec. 26-101. - Purpose. 
    This division is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the city. 
(Ord. No. 13-015, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 26-102. - Public nuisance declared. 
(a)  For purposes of this division the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  Noxious weeds as defined in Wis. Stats. § 66.0407, (Canada Thistle, Leafy Spurge, Field Bindweed or any weed designated as a noxious weed by the Department of Natural Resources by rule); 
(2)  Invasive weeds as defined in Wis. Stats. § 23.22, which are non-indigenous species whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Garlic Mustard, Black Locust, Common Teasel, Common Tansy, Japanese Knotwood, Common and Glossy Buckthorn, Exotic Bush Honeysuckle, Oriental Bittersweet or any plant designated by the Department of Natural Resources as invasive); 
(3)  Nuisance weeds as defined in Wis. Stats. § 23.235, (Purple Loosestrife or any nonnative member of the genus Lythrum, Poison Ivy, Poison Sumac, Stinging Nettle, Wild Parsnip, Poison Hemlock, Bitter Nightshade, Jimson Weed, Ragweed, Cocklebur and Sandburs). 
(b)  The common council finds that noxious weeds, invasive weeds and/or nuisance weeds on any lot and lawns, and grasses, on residential or commercial lots or parcels of land which exceed eight inches in length adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects property values of other land within the city. For that reason, any lawn, grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds eight inches in length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property located in a designated stormwater facility, floodplain area and/or wetland area, undeveloped parkland or city owned outlots, where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawn approved pursuant to division 3 of this article, or on vacant non-residential parcels as provided in section 26-105(c) or section 26-105(d). 
(Ord. No. 13-015, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 26-103. - Nuisances prohibited. 
    No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as defined in section 26-102 to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him within the city. 
(Ord. No. 13-015, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 26-104. - Enforcement. 
    If an owner of any property or parcel of land is found to be not in compliance with this section or of any previously approved natural lawn fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, such premises shall be deemed to be a public nuisance and the weed commissioner or his designee shall notify the property owner of the nuisance and direct the owner to abate said nuisance within five days. If the owner of any property or parcel so notified fails to abate such nuisance within five days, the weed commissioner or his designee is authorized to take actions to abate the nuisance and charge the cost thereof back to the property owner as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(Ord. No. 13-015, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 26-105. - Abatement of nuisance. 
(a)  If the weed commissioner shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance as defined in section 26-102 exists, he shall immediately cause written notice to be served that the city proposes to have the lot grass or lawn cut within five days so as to conform with this division, including the procedures under section 26-106. 
(b)  The notice may be served by: 
(1)  Personal service. 
(2)  Certified mail. 
(3)  Regular mail to the last known address of the owner, occupant or person in charge if the notice is posted, no later than the same day as mailing, on the front door of the main building, or dwelling on the premises, or if no building or dwelling exists, by posting on the premises in a conspicuous manner. 
(c)  Nonresidential vacant parcels. "Nonresidential vacant parcels" are defined as parcels located within nonresidential zoning districts, as well as vacant parcels planned for nonresidential development within approved planned developments, on which there are no improvements (i.e., dwelling unit, garage, commercial/industrial buildings). On nonresidential vacant parcels all grass and vegetation located in the terrace and from a depth up to 15 feet behind the right-of-way must be mowed so as to not permit or maintain any growth over eight inches in height. Noxious weeds as defined in this ordinance shall not be permitted over eight inches in height anywhere on vacant parcels. In addition nonresidential vacant parcels that abut a public park or a property with any improvement (i.e., dwelling unit, garage, commercial/industrial buildings) must be mowed so as not to permit or maintain any growth of grass or vegetation within 15 feet over eight inches in height along the property line. 
(d)  Cultivation of agricultural crops. An owner of a nonresidential vacant parcel may cultivate forage or legume crops that are harvested at least annually. Parcel owners choosing to cultivate permitted crops shall practice good agricultural and land conservation measures including practices to prevent erosion and the growth and spread of noxious weeds. No manures, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides shall be applied within 100 feet of a residential dwelling. Undeveloped parcels with naturally occurring grasses and weeds are not considered forage crop for purposes of this section and shall comply with section 26-105(c). 
(Ord. No. 13-015, 10-10-2013) 
Sec. 26-106. - Failure to abate nuisance. 
    In any case where the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his lawn, grass or weeds as set forth above, the city may: 
(1)  Cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject property so as to conform with this section and section 26-102. 
(2)  The city shall charge the expenses of providing the service at a rate as established by resolution by the common council. The charges for such mowing shall be the actual cost of mowing the lot plus an administrative charge as set forth in the city fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office. Notice of the bill for such mowing shall be mailed to the last known address of the owner of the parcel or lot and shall be payable within ten calendar days from the receipt thereof. 
a.  If said statement is not paid in full within 30 days thereafter, the city clerk shall enter the charges in the tax roll as a special charge against said lot or parcel of land as provided by Wis. Stat. § 66.027. 
b.  The failure of the city clerk to record such claim or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to place the city expense on the tax rolls for unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance as provided for in this division. 
(3)  Issue a citation or complaint in municipal court for failure to abate the public nuisance. Upon conviction, any person found guilty of violating this section shall be subject to the general penalty found in section 1-15. Each day that the public nuisance remains unabated shall constitute a separate violation. 
(4)  In addition to any penalties herein provided, the city may issue stop work orders upon owners of lots where work is unfinished under a previously issued building permit for any violation of this division.

(4)  Hearing on objection. Upon timely receipt of the permit holder's written objection, the matter shall be placed on the soonest legislative and regulatory committee agenda practicable for review. The legislative and regulatory committee shall act as a quasi-judicial body allowing the permit holder an opportunity to present evidence as to why the fire chiefs order should not be enforced. The fire chief's order shall be presumed to be valid, but such presumption may be overcome by the permit holder by evidence presented at the hearing. 
(5)  Determination after hearing. After the legislative and regulatory committee has made a decision and its' report has been approved by the common council, the permit holder shall be notified of the decision in writing, by certified mail. If a decision is made that the Fire Chiefs order was appropriately issued, the permit holder shall cease operation of the outdoor solid fuel-fired heating device within 24 hours.

Sec. 46-43. - Child safety zones. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the City of Portage from the risk that sexual offenders convicted of an offense against a child may re-offend in locations close to where children congregate. Given the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders, and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of re-offense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places. Therefore, the city finds and declares that sexual offenders are a serious threat to the public safety of children if regulatory measures are not in place that prohibit their presence in specified areas designated as places children commonly congregate. The City of Portage finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers, children congregate or play at child-oriented facilities, such as parks and playgrounds and libraries. It is not the intent of this section to impose a criminal penalty, but rather to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the children of the city by prohibiting convicted sexual offenders from loitering or being present in specified areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers. It is the further intent of this section to recognize that convicted sexual offenders must reenter the community and the city accepts that it has a responsibility to convicted sexual offenders and the surrounding area municipalities to ensure that, in addition to promoting regulatory measures aimed at protecting children, its regulatory measures are not aimed at prohibiting convicted sexual offenders from being part of this society.

Sec. 50-39. - Implements of husbandry. 
(a)  Purpose. The common council finds after due consideration, that regulating the weight of implements of husbandry on a per axle basis is more appropriate for maintenance purposes of all highways under the jurisdiction of the City of Portage. 
(b)  Authorization. Wis. Stat. § 348.15(9)(f) 1. provides that there is no weight limitation per wheel, axle, or group of axles for Category B implements of husbandry as defined in § 340.01 (24)(a)1.b, but does apply gross vehicle weight limitation to these vehicles. Wis. Stat. § 348.15{9)(f)1. authorizes a municipality to require compliance with axle weight limitations established under Wis. Stat. § 348.15(3)(g) for Category B implements of husbandry defined in Wis. Stat. § 340.01 (24)(a)1.b. on all highways under its jurisdiction. 
(c)  Regulation. 
(1)  All implements of husbandry, including Category B implements of husbandry defined in Wis. Stat. § 340.01(24)(a)1.b., may not exceed the weight limits imposed by Wis. Stat. § 348.15(3)(g). 
(2)  To exceed the length or weight limitations on highways under the jurisdiction of the city a no-fee permit may be applied for from the city department of public works. 
(3)  Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 348.27(19)(b)4m.a., in the event an application for a no-fee permit is made for a Category B implement of husbandry as defined in Wis. Stat. § 340.01(24)(a)1.b., the city is required to provide an approved alternate route, which may include highways that are not under the jurisdiction of the city if prior approval has been given by the jurisdiction over the alternate routes not under the city's jurisdiction for operation of Category B implements of husbandry as defined in Wis. Stat. §340.01 (24)(a)1.b.

State Law reference- Authority to regulate stopping standing parked, Wis. Stats. § 349.13. 

Sec. 50-72. - Restrictions on parking; posted limitations. 
(a)  Twenty-four hour limitation. No person, firm or corporation shall park or leave standing any automobile, truck, tractor, trailer or vehicle of any description on any public street or public parking lot owned by the city for a period of 24 or more consecutive hours in the same location at any time, except that where more restrictive parking limits have been established the more restrictive limits shall apply. When any law enforcement officer shall find a vehicle standing upon a public street or parking lot in violation of the provisions of this section, he is authorized to move such a vehicle or to require the operator in charge thereof to move such vehicle to a position permitted under this chapter. The law enforcement officer may cause said vehicle to be removed to a proper impoundment and storage area within the city where storage space is available and in such case the owner shall pay the costs of removing said vehicle and the storage fees on said vehicle before he may recover the possession thereof. 
(b)  Posted limitations. 
(1)  The common council may designate certain streets or portions of streets as no parking or no stopping or standing zones or as zones for parking by physically handicapped persons and may limit the hours in which the restrictions apply. The city shall mark, by appropriate signs or yellow curbing, each zone so designated in accordance with the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 349.13. 
(2)  Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or traffic control device, no person shall stop or park a vehicle in an established no stopping or standing zone when stopping or standing is prohibited. No vehicle shall be parked in a no parking zone during hours when parking is prohibited or where there is yellow curbing, except as permitted by state law or elsewhere by this Code. 
(3)  The chief of police or designee shall have the authority to restrict the turning or movement of heavy traffic and to impose special weight limitations on any highway or portions thereof which, because of the weakness of the roadbed due to deterioration or climatic conditions or other special or temporary conditions, would likely be seriously damaged or destroyed in the absence of any restrictions on heavy traffic movement or special weight limitations. 
(4)  No prohibition, restriction or limitation on parking or restriction on movement or turning of heavy traffic and imposition of special weight limits is effective unless official traffic control devices or yellow curbing have been placed or erected indicating the particular prohibition, restriction or limitation. 
(5)  After the parking limitations on any given street have expired, any change of location of not more than one stall following expiration of the parking period allowed shall be and constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(Code 1990, § 10-1-30) 
Sec. 50-73. - Parking restrictions during temporary snow removal or street maintenance. 
(a)  Street maintenance.

(4)  The application is made less than the required days in advance of the scheduled exclusive use. 
(5)  If it is for a use of the park or park facility at a date and time when, in addition to the proposed use, anticipated nonexclusive use by others of the park or park facility is expected and would be seriously adversely affected. 
(6)  If the law enforcement requirements of the exclusive use will require so large a number of persons as to prevent adequate law enforcement to the park, park facility or shelter area involved or of the rest of the city. 
(7)  The exclusive use will reasonably create a substantial risk of injury to persons or damage to property. 
(8)  The exclusive use is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in aggressive or destructive activity.

(p)  Emergency revocation. The chief of police or his or her designee may revoke a special event permit that has already been issued if the chief of police or fire chief or his or her designee determine that revocation is justified by an actual or potential emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace, or by a major change in the conditions forming the basis for the issuance of the permit.

b.  When a proposed school site or other public grounds shown on the master plan or official map of the city is located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision or minor land division, such proposed areas may be dedicated to the public, or reserved for a period of five years from the date of approval of the final plat or minor land division for the acquisition by the city, the town in which it is located, or any other appropriate agency having the authority to purchase said property.

(d)  Improvements. Before final approval of any plat or certified survey map, the developer shall enter into an agreement with the city to install the required improvements and shall file with the developer's agreement an irrevocable letter of credit or other appropriate sureties meeting the approval of the city attorney equal to the estimated cost of the improvements. Improvement cost estimates shall be made by the developer, reviewed by the city engineer and approved by the common council. The improvements may be installed after approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map by the developer or his subcontractors, but not later than one year from the date of recording of the final plat or certified survey map, or as provided in the developer's agreement. The developer's agreement shall specify a completion date for all improvements. 
(1)  Plans and specifications for all improvements shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer, in writing, prior to commencement of construction.

Stats. § 66.0703(7)(b), and shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the same manner as a lis pendens. Such consent and waiver shall provide that the installation of such services shall be made at the discretion of the common council. 
(e)  Variances. 
(1)  Granting of variances. Where, in the judgment of the common council, after report and recommendation by the plan commission, it would be inappropriate, owing to special conditions, to apply literally the provisions of this chapter and/or the lot size, minimum yard dimensions or maximum lot coverage of the zoning code set out in chapter 90, because an unnecessary hardship would result, the common council may waive or modify any such requirement to the extent deemed just and proper so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest served. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the developer to the city clerk at the time the preliminary plat or certified survey map is filed for consideration. The application shall include a statement with supporting evidence showing that the proposed variance shall conform to the standards set forth in this subsection and shall further include such additional information deemed necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter as may be required by the plan commission, the common council, or officers of the city. Upon receipt of the application and supporting materials, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing at such time and place as shall be established by the plan commission. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be given by publication as a Class 1 notice under the state statutes in the official city newspaper at least one week before the date of the hearing. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such public hearing shall also be sent to the developer, and to the property owners of record as listed in the office of the city assessor who are owners of each tax parcel situated in whole or in part within 100 feet of the boundaries of the site. This notice shall be mailed by first class mail at least ten days prior to the date of such public hearing to the address of each owner as shown in the city assessor's records for each affected tax parcel. Failure to comply with the foregoing publication and/or notice provisions or the failure of a person to receive notice shall not, however, invalidate any previous or subsequent action on the variance. The party requesting the variance shall carry the burden to prove to a reasonable certainty to the satisfaction of the plan commission that the facts and circumstances of the application establish an unnecessary hardship exists due to unique physical characteristics of the property and that the granting of the variance will neither harm the public interest nor undermine the purposes of the city codes. In order to prove unnecessary hardship, the following three standards must be proven: 
a.  Compliance with the strict letter of the applicable restriction would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. Under this standard, the plan commission must judge what is a feasible use for the property as a whole and a variance is not warranted if the physical character of the property will allow the owner to build or develop the property in compliance with the applicable codes; 
b.  The hardship or difficulty must relate to the unique physical characteristics of the property and the hardship or difficulty must be peculiar to the property in question and different from that of other parcels and not one which affects all parcels similarly, nor must the hardship be self-imposed nor must the hardship or difficulty be due solely to the desires of or conditions personal to the applicant, such as the desire to increase the value or income potential of the property; and 
c.  The granting of a variance must neither harm the public nor undermine the purposes of the city codes. The plan commission shall protect the interests of the public at large and shall preserve the enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and the same vicinity. A lack of local opposition shall not in itself mean that a variance will not harm the public interest. 
After conducting the public hearing, the plan commission shall make a written report and recommendation to the common council. After receiving the plan commission's report and recommendation, the common council may grant such variances to the extent and upon such terms as deemed just and proper such that the spirit of the codes is observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Unless otherwise expressly directed by the common council, no public hearing shall be held before the common council to consider the granting or denial of a variance under this chapter. 
(2)  Monuments. The common council may waive the placing of monuments, required under Wis. Stats. § 236.15(1)(b), (c) and (d), for a reasonable time on condition that the developer execute a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit to ensure the placing of such monuments within the required time limits established by the city. 
(f)  Land suitability. No land shall be platted or subdivided for a use which is held unsuitable by the plan commission for reason of flooding or potential flooding, soil limitations, inadequate drainage, steep topography, incompatible surrounding land use, or any other condition likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents or users of the area, or harmful to the community. 
(1)  Determination of suitability. Except as provided herein, the plan commission shall determine land suitability prior to the time the preliminary plat or certified survey is considered for approval, following review and recommendations by the appropriate city commissions and committees. The plan commission may impose special conditions in the plat or certified survey map deemed necessary to protect the health, safety or welfare of future residents of the area. The areas which are found to be environmentally sensitive shall be considered for preservation as open space. The determination of land suitability will be evaluated through the environmental assessment procedures set forth in this chapter. The developer shall furnish such maps, data and information as may be necessary to make a determination of land suitability. 
(2)  Determination land is unsuitable; additional evidence in support of subdivision. Should the plan commission determine that the land is unsuitable for the intended use or development, it shall state its reasons in writing to the developer within 45 days of initial plan commission action. The developer may present additional evidence to support the proposed subdivision. Upon review of the additional evidence, the plan commission shall affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
(3)  Appeal of determination. The developer may appeal the determination of land suitability as provided in this chapter. 
(g)  Subdivisions or minor land divisions in extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction. Jurisdiction of these regulations shall include all lands within the corporate limits of the city as well as the unincorporated area within the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the city and the city elects to approve subdivisions, plats, replats and minor land divisions under its extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction as provided in Wis. Stats. ch. 236 and Wis. Stats. § 66.0105. Any subdivision, minor land division or replat within the city's extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction, except those governed by Columbia County Ordinance 16-1-5(b)(2) including any future revisions thereto, shall be subject to approval in accordance with this chapter. 
(h)  Minimum lot or parcel size for lots or parcels not served by public sanitary sewer system. In order to maintain the quality of a subdivision or minor land division and the orderly layout and use of land and to prevent undue concentration of population using private sanitary systems and to protect the groundwater and the environment and to ensure the best possible environment for human occupation, it is necessary in the public health, safety and welfare to establish minimum lot or parcel sizes for any lot or parcel not served by a public sanitary sewer system. The minimum lot or parcel size for a lot or parcel to be used for residential purposes where the lot or parcel is not served by a public sanitary sewer system shall be 20 acres per dwelling unit. The minimum lot or parcel size for a lot or parcel to be used for a commercial, business or industrial use where the lot or parcel is not served by a public sanitary sewer system shall be 20 acres. In order to meet the minimum lot or parcel size requirements of this subsection, the lot or parcel shall be a single piece of contiguous land excluding from area measurement any street or railroad right-of-way, or navigable waterway. A special exception to the requirements of this subsection may be granted by the plan commission or common council if a tax parcel existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, containing an existing single-family dwelling used for residential purposes, with or without accessory buildings, is proposed to be divided by a certified survey map showing two or more lots of record so as to locate the existing dwelling and accessory buildings on a lot less than 20 acres in area provided that the lot with the dwelling satisfies the applicable minimum lot size requirements for the municipality where the lot is located and provided further that the entire tax parcel is subdivided by the certified survey map and each remainder lot of record resulting from the land division meets one or more of the following preconditions: 
(1)  Each remainder lot of record is vacant land and each such remainder lot is at least 20 acres in area or greater; or 
(2)  Each remainder lot of record is vacant land and the certified survey map for the proposed land division combines such remainder lot with a contiguous, single tax parcel existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived thereby creating a lot of record which is sufficient in size to meet the applicable minimum lot size requirements for the municipality where it is located. 
In this subsection, the term "existing single-family dwelling used for residential purposes" means a dwelling occupied and used as a residence as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and continuously thereafter to the date of the application and which dwelling satisfies the applicable ordinances of the municipality where it is located for continuation of such use. The term "lot of record" means a parcel of contiguous land under one ownership shown on a certified survey map prepared under Wis. Stats. § 236.34 and which is undivided by a street, railroad right-of-way, dedicated right-of-way, or navigable waterway. The applicant for the land division shall carry the burden of proof to establish that a proposed land division meets the requirements of this subsection. A special exception may also be granted to the minimum lot or parcel size requirements of this subsection where the property owner consents in writing that a covenant or deed restriction shall be entered on the certified survey map specifying that the undersized lot or parcel is unbuildable for any residential, commercial, business, or industrial purpose or use. The minimum lot size requirements for a lot served by a public sanitary sewer system shall be in accordance with the zoning requirements as set forth in the city's zoning code set out in chapter 90. The provisions of this subsection shall supersede and control the minimum lot size requirements set forth in other sections of this chapter. 
(i)  Special procedures where Wis. Admin. Code ch. TRANS 233 applies to a land division. Whenever Wis. Admin. Code ch. TRANS 233 applies to a land division within the city, the following procedures and standards shall apply: 
(1)  The preliminary plat, final plat, or certified survey map shall not be considered filed with the city for approval until the plat or map has been approved by the state department of transportation pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code ch. TRANS 233. 
(2)  The common council shall be authorized to establish the same setback area for city zoning purposes as the setback area approved by the state department of transportation, where, in the judgment of the common council, after report and recommendation by the plan commission, the setback established by the state department of transportation will not be contrary to the public interest and where such allowed setback is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the city's zoning code set out in chapter 90. Any setback allowed by the common council under this section may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as determined by the common council to be in the public interest. The plat or map shall clearly show the boundary of the setback line. 
(j)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an objection to a plat or a failure to approve a plat may appeal such objection or failure to approve as provided in Wis. Stats. § 236.13(5) within 30 days of notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action. 
(Ord. No. 03-002, § 14-1-2, 3-25-2004) 
Sec. 70-3. - Land division procedure. 
(a)  Preapplication environment assessment, public facilities and services. 
(1)  Preapplication. Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map, it is recommended that the developer consult with the plan commission or the city engineer in order to obtain their advice and assistance. This consultation is intended to inform the developer of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, other provisions of this Code, sewer and water availability, other engineering considerations, duly adopted city plans and to otherwise assist the developer in planning his development. In so doing, both the developer and the plan commission may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and the community. The developer will also gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(2)  Environmental assessment. A checklist may be prepared by the developer for review at the preapplication conference. 
a.  Purpose. The purpose of this environmental assessment checklist is to provide the basis for an orderly, systematic review of the effects of all new subdivisions upon the community environment in accordance with the principles and procedures of Wis. Stats. § 236.45(1). The plan commission will use these procedures and the environmental assessment checklist in determining land suitability under this chapter. The goals of the community in requiring this checklist are to eliminate or reduce pollution and siltation to an acceptable standard, assume ample living space per capita, preserve open space and parks for recreation, provide adequately for storm water control, maintain scenic beauty and aesthetic surroundings, administer to the economic and cultural needs of the citizens and provide for the effective and efficient flow of goods and services. 
b.  Coverage. The environmental assessment checklist shall apply to all condominiums and subdivisions, including minor subdivisions. The plan commission may waive the requirement for the filing of an environmental assessment checklist for minor subdivisions of less than five acres total area. 
c.  Environmental checklist. The minimum preliminary checklist for environmental assessment of plats and land divisions and community development plans shall be provided by the city engineer. 
d.  Determination of need for expanded environmental assessment. The environmental assessment checklist shall be reviewed by the plan commission at its next regular meeting following submittal. The plan commission may, at that time, for reasons stated in a written resolution setting forth specific questions on which it requires research, data and input from the developer and other affected persons, decide that the preliminary environmental assessment raises unusually significant questions of the effects on the environment and that review by other city committees and commissions is required and/or that an unusually high level of citizen interest has resulted from questions raised in a preliminary assessment. The listing of questions can include items which this chapter already enables the commission to obtain, or it may include additional information which is relevant to the questions specified in the resolution. The resolution may also request data on the specific impact questions from other governmental agencies or from the developer or applicant. The resolution shall set a reasonable date for the return of the requested data and information, and it may specify the format in which the data is to be presented. 
e.  Hearing on environmental assessment report. Following the return to the plan commission of the data required in the resolution adopted under the section above, the plan commission shall make such report available for scrutiny by the applicant or petitioner, by city departments, commissions and committees and by other interested persons or agencies. The plan commission may schedule and hold a public hearing on the findings of the report. The hearing shall be preceded by a Class 1 notice under Wis. Stats. ch. 985. Persons attending such hearing shall be afforded an opportunity to comment on the report. 
f.  Review. The plan commission shall review the environmental assessment report, with supporting data, department and committee reviews and any other data required for determining the suitability of the land for the proposed development. Within 45 days after submission to the plan commission of the final expanded environmental assessment report, the plan commission shall decide whether said land is suitable for development. 
(3)  Public facilities and services-Review and determination of adequacy. 
a.  A certified survey, preliminary plat or final plat shall not be approved unless the plan commission and the common council determine that adequate public facilities and public services are available to meet the needs of the proposed subdivision. 
b.  The applicant shall furnish any data requested by the city engineer who shall transmit this information to appropriate city commissions, committees and boards for review and shall act as coordinator for their reports to the plan commission and the common council on the adequacy of water, sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police, parks and open space and recreation facilities, and transportation facilities. 
c.  Public facilities and public services for a proposed subdivision may be found to be adequate when the following conditions exist: 
1.  The proposed subdivision is located in an urban service area where mainline interceptor sewer service is presently under construction, or designated by the common council for extension of sewer service. The plan commission and the common council shall also consider the recommendations of the city engineer and the municipal services and utilities committee on the capacity of trunk lines and of sewerage treatment facilities and any other information presented. 
2.  The proposed subdivision is located within an urban service area serviced by an arterial transmission water main with adequate capacity for the proposed development or if the water distribution system that is needed is under construction or scheduled for construction. The plan commission and the common council shall consider the recommendations of the city engineer on line capacities, water sources and storage facilities as well as any other information presented. 
3.  The city engineer recommends to the plan commission and the common council that adequate facilities are available to ensure the proper stormwater management. 
4.  The manager of parks and recreation recommends that future residents of the proposed subdivision can be assured park, recreation and open space areas, facilities and services meet the standards of the comprehensive outdoor recreation plan. 
5.  The police department and fire department verify that timely and adequate service can be provided to the residents. 
6.  The proposed subdivision is accessible by existing publicly maintained, all weather roads adequate to accommodate both existing traffic and that traffic to be generated by the proposed subdivision, or necessary additional roads and road improvements are budgeted for construction with public or private financing. 
7.  Where the plan commission and the common council determine that one or more public facilities or services are not adequate for the proposed development, but that a portion of the area could be served adequately, or that careful phasing of the development could result in all public facilities and public services being adequate, conditional approval may include only such portions or may specify phasing of the development. 
(b)  Preliminary plat review. 
(1)  Submission of plats. Before submitting a final plat for approval, the developer shall prepare a preliminary plat and a letter of application. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and the developer shall comply with the procedures of Wis. Stats. §§ 236.11 and 236.12, and shall file an adequate number of copies of the plat and application with the city clerk at least 25 days prior to the meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired. The city clerk shall transmit copies, as appropriate, to agencies specified in Wis. Stats. § 236.12, and ten copies to the plan commission. 
(2)  Review of plats. The plan commission, hereby designated as the approving authority for all preliminary plats, shall transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to all affected boards, commissions or departments and, unless the developer has elected to submit directly to the state as provided in Wis. Stats. § 236.12(6), and all affected local utility companies for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their recommendations shall be transmitted to the plan commission within 20 days from the date the plat is filed. The preliminary plat shall then be reviewed by the plan commission for conformance with this chapter and all ordinances, rules, regulations, general plan and general plan components that affect it. 
(c)  Preliminary plat approval. If any agency, board, commission, department or utility has an objection, the objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary plat, notify the subdivider and all other approving and objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the city clerk. If an objecting agency fails to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. In addition: 
(1)  The plan commission shall, within 90 days of the date of filing of a preliminary plat with the city clerk, approve, approve conditionally, or reject such plat unless an extension of the review period is mutually agreed upon in writing. One copy of the plat shall thereupon be returned to the subdivider by the city clerk with the date and action endorsed thereon; and if approved conditionally or rejected, a letter of transmittal and a copy of the plan commission meeting minutes setting forth the conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection shall accompany the plat. One copy each of the plat and letter shall be placed in the plan commission's permanent file. 
(2)  Failure of the plan commission to act within 90 days shall constitute an approval of the plat as filed unless the review period is extended by mutual consent. 
(3)  Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat filed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except if the final plat is submitted within six months of the preliminary plat approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as indicated in this chapter. If the final plat is submitted within six months after the last required approval of a preliminary plat filed with the city after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the final plat shall be entitled to approval if the final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any conditions of that approval and to local plans and ordinances adopted as authorized by law. 
(4)  A subdivider submitting a preliminary plat not in compliance with this chapter shall file an application for a variance as provided in this chapter, at the same time that the subdivider files the application for approval of the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Any action of the plan commission in approving, conditionally approving, or rejecting a preliminary plat may be appealed to the common council, by filing a written request for an appeal with the city clerk within ten days after the date of the plan commission's action in approving, conditionally approving, or rejecting the preliminary plat. 
(d)  Final plat review. 
(1)  The subdivider shall submit a final plat and a letter of application in accordance with this chapter and Wis. Stats. §§ 236.11 and 236.12 and shall file an adequate number of copies of the plat and the application with the city clerk at least 20 days prior to the meeting of the plan commission at which review is desired. 
(2)  The city clerk shall transmit copies, as appropriate, to agencies specified in Wis. Stats. § 236.12 and shall transmit the original final plat and ten copies to the plan commission. A copy shall also be submitted to each public utility affected. 
(3)  The plan commission shall examine the final plat as to its conformance with the approved preliminary plat; any conditions of approval of the preliminary plat; this chapter and all ordinances, rules, regulations, general plan and general plan components which may affect it, and shall recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the plat to the common council. 
(4)  Partial platting. The final plat may, if permitted by the plan commission, constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record at that time. 
(e)  Final plat approval. If any agency, board, commission, department or utility has an objection, the objecting agencies shall, within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the final plat, notify the developer and all other approving and objecting agencies of any objections. If there are no objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy of the plat and shall return that copy to the plan commission. If an objecting agency fails to act within 20 days, it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. 
(1)  Submission. If the final plat is not submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat, the common council may reject the final plat in writing. 
(2)  Plan commission recommendation. The plan commission shall, within 30 days of the date of filing of the final plat with the city clerk, recommend approval or rejection of the plat and shall transmit the final plat and application, along with its recommendations, to the common council. 
(3)  Notification. The plan commission shall, at the time it recommends approval or rejection of a plat to the common council and at least three days prior to any action of the common council, give notice of its recommendation to the clerk of any municipality within which the plat is located. 
(4)  Common council approval or rejection. The common council shall, within 60 days of the date of filing the original final plat with the city clerk, approve or reject such plat unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. If the plat is rejected, the reasons shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting and a copy of the minutes, together with a letter of transmittal shall be forwarded to the subdivider. The common council may not approve the final plat unless the city clerk certifies on the face of the plat that the copies were forwarded to objecting agencies as required herein, the date thereof, and that no objections have been filed within 20 days or, if filed, have been met. 
(5)  Timely common council action required. Failure of the common council to take action on the plat within 60 days, and time having not been extended and no unsatisfied objections having been filed, the plat shall be deemed approved. 
(6)  Consent and waiver. Prior to the acceptance of a final plat, the owner shall furnish, when required by the city, a consent and waiver of the statutory provisions for special assessment for the installation of sanitary sewer, storm sewer, sewer laterals, water main, water laterals, curb and gutter, sidewalk, street surfacing, underground street lighting services and all other utilities, which will be in a form approved by the city attorney pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.60(18), and shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the same manner as a lis pendens. Such consent and waiver shall provide that the installation of such services shall be made at the discretion of the common council. 
(7)  Recordation. After the final plat has been approved by the common council and required improvements either installed or a contract and sureties insuring their installation is filed, the city clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to such approval to be duly executed and shall further cause the plat to be recorded within 30 days of its approval by the common council and payment by the subdivider for the recording fee. 
(8)  Plat copies. The subdivider shall file ten certified copies of the final plat with the city clerk for distribution to appropriate local agencies and offices. 
(f)  Replat. When it is proposed to replat a recorded subdivision, or part thereof, the subdivider or person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded plat as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 236.40-236.44. The subdivider or person wishing to replat shall then proceed as specified in subsections (e)(1)-(3) of this section. Court vacations of plats are required when areas dedicated to the public are altered. The city clerk shall schedule, within the time period specified in subsection (e)(3) of this section for the plan commission to take action upon the plat, a public hearing before the plan commission when a preliminary plat or a replat of lands within the city is filed, and shall cause notices of the proposed replat and public hearing to be mailed to the owners of all properties within the limits of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat and to the owners of all properties within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat. 
(g)  Minor land divisions. 
(1)  Use of certified survey map. All minor land divisions shall be subdivided by use of a certified survey map.

(c)  Deed restrictions. The plan commission may require that deed restrictions imposed by the developer be filed with the final plat. 
(d)  Plat restrictions. The plan commission may require that plat restrictions intended to reflect city plans and ordinances be placed on the face of the plat. 
(e)  Survey accuracy. The city engineer shall examine all final plats within the city and may make, or cause to be made by a registered land surveyor under the supervision or direction of the city engineer, field checks for the accuracy and closure of survey, the proper kind and location of monuments and the legibility and completeness of the drawing. In addition: 
(1)  Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in 5,000, nor in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure is obtained. When a satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained, the survey of the exterior boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure. 
(2)  All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If field checks disclose an error for any interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 3,000, or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not exceed the value of 11/2 minutes multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case exceed five minutes of arc. 
(f)  Relocated quarter corners. Where the plat is located within a quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the county, the tie required by Wis. Stats. § 236.20(3)(b) shall be expressed in terms of grid bearing and distance; and the material and Wisconsin State plane coordinates of the monument making the relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error of closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. 
(g)  Common council review. The common council shall receive the results of the city engineer and the state's examination prior to approving the final plat. 
(h)  Surveying and monumenting. All final plats shall meet all the surveying and monumenting requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15. 
(i)  County coordinate system. All plats shall be tied directly to a section or quarter corner monumented according to the county coordinate system. The exact grid bearing and distance of such tie shall be determined by field measurements, and the material and county plane coordinates of the monument marking the section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error of closure specified in subsection (e) of this section for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to the county coordinate system, south zone. 
(j)  Certificates. All final plats shall provide all the certificates required by Wis. Stats. § 236.21 and, in addition, the surveyor shall certify that he has fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter. The subdivider's certificate shall be fully executed prior to common council approval. 
(k)  Recordation. After the final plat has been approved by the common council and required improvements either installed or a contract and sureties insuring their installation is filed, the city clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to such approval to be duly executed and shall further cause the plat to be recorded within 30 days of its approval by the common council and payment by the subdivider for the recording fee. 
(l)  Duplicate plat to be filed. An identical reproducible copy, on stable drafting film at least four miles thick, along with the recording data, shall be placed on file with the city engineer. An electronic file of the planview construction along with all as-built information shall be provided in an acceptable format to the city engineer to be incorporated into city digital mapping.

(Ord. No. 03-002, § 14-1-6, 3-25-2004) 
Sec. 70-7. - Design standards. 
(a)  Street arrangement. In any new plat or certified survey map, the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location indicated on the official map or general plan of the city. In areas for which such plans have not been completed, the street layout shall recognize the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall be developed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets and to the most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street. In addition: 
(1)  Arterial streets. Arterial streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. Arterial streets shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of arterial streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(2)  Collector streets. Collector streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major streets to which they connect. 
(3)  Local streets. Local streets, as hereafter defined, shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(4)  Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. 
(5)  Arterial street and highway protection. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a major street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties shall be provided. Limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic may be required for double frontage or corner lots. Screen planting or an earth berm contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear or side property line, or the use of frontage streets, may also be required when deemed appropriate by the plan commission. 
(6)  Stream or lake shores. Stream or lake shores shall have a minimum of 60 feet of public access platted to the low water mark at intervals of not more than one-half mile as required by Wis. Stats. § 236.16(3). 
(7)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is placed with the common council under conditions approved by the plan commission. 
(8)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas for off-street loading and service access if required by the plan commission, but shall not be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall not be approved. Alleys shall not connect to a major thoroughfare. 
(9)  Street names. Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names elsewhere in the city and environs, and existing street names shall be projected wherever possible. 
(b)  Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way treatment. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, the design shall provide the following treatment: 
(1)  When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad right-of-way, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth and/or an earth berm shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be part of the platted lots, but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs, the building of structures and placement of longitudinal easements for utilities hereon is prohibited." 
(2)  Commercial and industrial properties shall have provided, on each side of the limited access highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than 150 feet. 
(3)  Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting an arterial street and highway or collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(4)  Local streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided and location of local streets immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas. 
(c)  Street design standards. 
(1)  Minimum width of proposed streets. The minimum right-of-way and roadway width of all proposed streets and alleys shall be as specified by the general plan, general plan component or official map of the city, or if no width is specified therein, the minimum widths shall be as shown in Table 1 below. Cross sections for freeways, expressways, and parkways shall be based upon detailed engineering studies. 
TABLE 1 
RECOMMENDED MINIMUM CROSS SECTIONS 
System Right-of-Way Width in Feet Pavement Width in Feet Arterial 80 48 Collector Desirable - 80 
Minimum - 66 40 Local 66 36  
(2)  Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not exceed 500 feet in length. All cul-de-sac streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right of way radius of 66 feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 40 feet. 
(3)  Street grades. Unless necessitated by exceptional topography subject to the approval of the plan commission the maximum center line grade of any street or public way shall not exceed the following: 
a.  Arterial streets: Six percent. 
b.  Collector streets: Eight percent. 
c.  Local streets, alleys and frontage streets: Ten percent. 
d.  Pedestrian ways: 12 percent, unless steps of acceptable design are provided. 
e.  The grade of any new street shall in no case exceed ten percent or be less than 0.5 percent. 
(4)  Length of vertical curves. Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth and general leveling of topography. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 30 times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for all arterial and collector streets, and 15 times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for all other streets, or as approved by the city engineer. 
(5)  Radii of curvature. When a continuous street center line defects at any one point by more than ten degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said center line of not less than the following: 
a.  Arterial streets and highways: 500 feet. 
b.  Collector streets: 300 feet. 
c.  Local streets: 100 feet. A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(6)  Half streets. Where, on the date of original enactment of this chapter, an existing dedicated or platted half street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of half streets is not permitted. 
(d)  Street intersections. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. In addition: 
(1)  The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two. 
(2)  The number of intersections along arterial streets and highways shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance between such intersections shall not be less than 1,000 feet. 
(3)  Intersections on local streets shall be offset at least 300 feet measured from the centerlines of the two streets. 
(4)  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of 15 feet or of a greater radius when required by the plan commission. 
(5)  Local streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets; but, if the center lines of such local streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within 300 feet of each other, measured along the center line of the arterial or collector street, then the location shall be so adjusted that the center line intersection across the arterial or collector street is continuous; and a jog is avoided. 
(e)  Blocks. The widths, lengths and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the planned use of the land, zoning requirements, need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the limitations and opportunities of topography. In addition: 
(1)  The length of blocks in residential areas shall not, as a general rule, be less than 400 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in length unless otherwise dictated by exceptional topography or other limiting factors of good design. 
(2)  Interior block pedestrian ways are generally not desired and should be avoided; however, pedestrian ways of not less than ten feet in width may be required near the center and entirely across any block over 900 feet in length where deemed essential by the plan commission to provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, parks, shopping centers, churches or transportation facilities. 
(3)  The width of blocks shall be wide enough to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic. Width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated and the area zoning restrictions for such use. 
(4)  Utility easements are required around all lots created in accordance with this chapter. 
(f)  Lots. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting for the building contemplated. In addition: 
(1)  Side lot lines shall be approximately right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines on which the lots face. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them. 
(2)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(3)  Every lot shall front or abut for a distance of at least 40 feet on a public street and have a minimum width of 80 feet at the building line. 
(4)  Area and dimensions of lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning code as set out in chapter 90 except in areas not served by a public sanitary sewer system, the subdivision or minor land division shall conform to the minimum lot size requirements of this chapter. The type, design, installation and maintenance of a private sanitary system, where approved, shall meet the requirements of all state and local codes and regulations. Whenever a tract is subdivided into large parcels, each parcel shall be arranged and dimensioned as to allow resubdivision of any such parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Depth of lots shall be a minimum of 100 feet. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of 2:1 shall be considered a desirable ratio under normal conditions. Depth of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking required by the use contemplated. 
(6)  Width of lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning code as set out in chapter 90. 
(7)  Corner lots shall have an extra width of 15 feet to permit adequate building setbacks from side streets. 
(8)  Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise unplattable lands which may lie between a proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a wetland, lake, or stream. 
(g)  Building setback lines. Where not controlled by zoning regulations, building setback lines, appropriate to the location and type of development contemplated, shall be established as may be required by the plan commission. 
(h)  Electrical and communications utilities. 
(1)  All new electric distribution lines (excluding lines of 15,000 volts or more), all new telephone lines from which lots are individually served, all new telegraph lines, and community antenna television cables and services, installed within a newly platted residential area, mobile home park or planned residential development shall be underground unless the plan commission shall specifically find, after study, that: 
a.  The placing of such facilities underground would not be compatible with the planned development; 
b.  Location, topography, soil, stands of trees or other physical conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impracticable; or 
c.  The lots to be served by said facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities. 
(2)  Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric and communications systems such as, but not limited to, substations, pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches and above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes may be located above ground. 
(3)  The developer or his agent shall furnish proof to the plan commission that such arrangements as may be required under applicable rates and rules filed with the state public service commission have been made with the owner or owners of such lines or services for placing their respective facilities underground as required by this section, as a condition precedent to approval of the final plat or certified survey map. 
(4)  Temporary overhead facilities may be installed to serve a construction site or where necessary because of severe weather conditions. In the latter case, within a reasonable time after weather conditions have moderated, such temporary facilities shall be replaced by underground facilities and the temporary facilities removed, subject to any exception permitted by the plan commission. 
All aerial facilities for new electric distribution lines (excluding lines of 15,000 volts or more), all new telephone lines from which lots are individually served, all new telegraph lines, community antenna television cables and services, installed subsequent to the approval of this chapter shall be placed in utility easements within a newly platted residential area, mobile home park or planned residential development, unless waived by the plan commission. 
(i)  Easements. 
(1)  Electrical and communication facilities. 
a.  Adequate easements shall be provided and dedicated on each side of all rear lot lines, and on side lot lines, across lots or along front lot lines where necessary, for the installation of electric and communications facilities. Such easements shall be noted as "utility easements" on the final plat or certified survey map. Prior to approval of the final plat or certified survey map, the concurrence of the electric and communications companies serving the area as to the location and width of the utility easements shall be noted on the final plat or certified survey map. 
b.  Where the electric and communications facilities are to be installed underground, the utility easements shall be graded to within six inches of final grade by the developer, prior to the installation of such facilities, and earth fill, piles or mounds of dirt or construction materials shall not be stored on such easement areas. 
c.  Where the electric and/or communications facilities are to be installed underground a note shall be placed on the final plat or certified survey map stating that the final grade established by the developer on the utility easements shall not be altered by more than six inches by the developer, his agent, or by subsequent owners of the lots on which such utility easements are located, except with written consent of the utility or utilities involved. 
d.  Distribution gas mains and appurtenances, except service laterals, shall be installed in street right of way, normally in the area between sidewalk and curb. However, the plan commission may, at the request of the utility, or where deemed necessary or desirable, require easements of adequate width for the intended purpose along lot lines or across lots for such installations and such easements shall be noted on the final plat or certified survey map as "Utility easements for existing and future underground utilities of all types." 
(2)  Typical easements for utilities and drainage. 
a.  Provide typical easements around all lots in all plats and certified survey maps, with the following note on the plat or survey: 
"Note: Utility easements may be used for surface storm water drainage and any required underground utility construction including, but not limited to, storm sewer, sanitary sewer facilities, water main, electrical, phone, fiber optic, wire cable, and other underground utility uses." 
b.  For residential zoning districts, the typical easement dimensions shall be 15 feet along street right-of-way and six feet along side and rear lot lines. 
c.  For commercial and industrial districts, the typical easement dimensions shall be 25 feet along the street right-of-way and 15 feet along the side and rear lot lines. 
(j)  Drainage and greenway/environmental corridor easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a wetland, waterway, drainageway, channel or stream, or mapped greenway/environmental corridor, an adequate drainageway or easement shall be provided as required by the plan commission conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway or easement shall be subject to the approval of the plan commission and shall at least include a 25-foot natural buffer strip above the known floodplain or inundation level. Parallel streets or parkways may be required. Storm water drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to accommodate the flow resulting from the 100-year rainfall event of any duration, such sizes and design details to be subject to review and approval by the city engineer. 
(k)  Erosion control. The developer shall employ erosion control measures to prevent erosion, siltation, sedimentation, and washing and blowing of dirt and debris from excavation, grading, open cuts, side slopes and related activities of the developer or contractors. Such measures shall include, but not be limited to, seeding, sodding, mulching, watering, ponding, and the construction of berms. Erosion control plans shall meet the requirements of chapter 10, articles VII and VIII. 
(l)  Intra-block drainage and foundation design. 
(1)  At least three weeks prior to submittal of final plat for review and approval, the developer shall submit to the city engineer a surface water drainage plan for the plat. This plan may be part of the erosion control plan. The plan shall indicate but not be limited to the following: elevation of streets, existing topography of the block, proposed drainage swales, and indication of the direction of drainage. 
(2)  Upon approval of the plan, the developer shall place on the final plat arrows to indicate the direction of drainage swales required for intra-block drainage and the following note: "Arrows indicate direction of drainage swale construction during grading and said swales shall be maintained by the lot owner unless modified with approval of the city engineer." 
(3)  A minimum ten-foot wide drainage easement (five feet on each side of the property line) shall be retained along all joint property lines on the plat. Such easement shall be designated as a stormwater drainage easement, and shall conform to the drainage plan. 
(4)  Where a developer's subsoil investigation indicates potential for groundwater less than ten feet from the proposed street centerline elevation, the developer shall so note on the face of the plat and indicate the lots affected. 
(m)  Stormwater management. 
(1)  The following goals and objectives shall apply to stormwater management: 
a.  To prevent significant loss of life and property due to runoff from any foreseeable rainfall event. 
b.  To encourage the design of system which minimize potential erosion and sedimentation problems. 
c.  To maintain the surface water quality. 
d.  To encourage the design of systems which respond to the need to maintain or enhance groundwater resources, including groundwater quality, except where land stability might be impaired. 
e.  To encourage the design of systems which will reduce capital and environmental costs to the community. 
(2)  At the time a preliminary plat, condo plat, a certified survey, or a planned development is submitted to the plan commission for approval, the developer or subdivider shall prepare a study of the drainage basin of the area in which the proposed development is located. The study shall include the design, routing and estimated construction cost of a storm water management system to serve the site and/or drainage basin of the area in which the proposed development is located, in accordance with chapter 10, article VIII. 
(3)  The proposed development shall not increase stormwater runoff (peak) from that which would have resulted from the same storm occurring over the site with the land in its natural undeveloped state, for storms of a 24-hour duration and all reoccurrence intervals of less than or equal to 100 years. In the case of closed drainage basins, which have no outlets during normal rainfall, the volume of runoff resulting from a ten-year storm of 24-hour duration shall not be greater after development than when the land was in its natural undeveloped state. 
(4)  Land in its natural undeveloped state shall mean land which has runoff characteristics equivalent to runoff curve numbers (CN) of 30, 58, 71, and 78 for hydrologic soil groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. 
(5)  Determination of storm volumes shall be computed by established procedures equivalent to and calibrated against that procedure promulgated by the United States Soil Conservation Service in its National Engineering Handbook or the technical publication entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, TR-55," and accepted by the city engineer. 
(6)  Design of stormwater management facilities shall be in accordance with this chapter and chapter 10, articles VII and VIII of this Code. Stormwater peaks and volumes shall be addressed either through on-site detention, retention, infiltration, storm sewer conveyance, or a combination. It is the intent of these provisions to encourage on-site detention and infiltration to the greatest extent possible. 
(n)  Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any lot within the subdivision, and removal of such items and materials shall be required prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy on any subdivision lot. By the date specified in the developer's agreement or by the date of dedication of public improvements within the subdivision, whichever is sooner, all lands within the subdivision shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  None of the items and materials described above shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision. 
(2)  All lots shall be graded in accordance with the subdivision grading plan and no piles of dirt shall be allowed. 
(3)  All lands shall be seeded so as to prevent erosion and the owner of each lot or out-lot within the subdivision shall keep his lot mowed and in compliance with the city's weed control ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 03-002, § 14-1-7, 3-25-2004) 
Sec. 70-8. - Required improvements. 
(a)  Survey monuments. The subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15 and as may be required by the city engineer. 
(b)  Grading. After the installation of temporary block corner monuments by the subdivider, review and approval of street grades by the city engineer, the subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all streets proposed to be dedicated in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the city engineer. The subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the street rights-of-way to subgrade together with side slopes beyond the street right-of-way when required. Cut and filled lands shall be graded to a maximum slope of 4:1 or the soil's angle of repose, whichever is the lesser, and covered with permanent vegetation. 
(c)  Surfacing. After the installation of all utility and stormwater drainage improvements, the developer shall surface all roadways in streets proposed to be dedicated to the widths prescribed by this section and the general plan or general plan components of the city. Said surfacing shall be done in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the city engineer. Existing roadways which do not meet city specifications shall be improved by the developer before they will be accepted by the city. The cost of surfacing major streets in excess of 36 feet shall be borne by the city. 
(d)  Curb and gutter. After the installation of all public utility and stormwater drainage improvements, the developer shall construct concrete curbs and gutters in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the city engineer. This requirement may be waived where a permanent rural section has been approved by the common council. Wherever possible, provisions shall be made at the time of construction for driveway access curb cuts.

This requirement applies not only to lands proposed to be subdivided, but also to all lands under option to the developer or in which he holds any interest and which are contiguous to the lands proposed to be subdivided and which abut a lake or stream as provided in Wis. Stats. § 236.16(4). 
(4)  Access to dedicated lands. Land dedicated for public purposes shall be deemed to the city at the time the final plat is approved. 
(5)  Utility extensions. The developer shall install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines to the property line of all dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to adjacent properties. 
(6)  Dedication criteria. The plan commission shall determine whether the developer shall be required to dedicate land or pay a fee in lieu of dedication. The plan commission shall also determine the location of sites dedicated to such public uses and the types of uses to which said sites shall be put. In making these determinations, consideration shall be given to the needs of the community in general and of the residents of the proposed subdivision or other land division, correlation with existing and planned sites and facilities dedicated for such public uses, feasibility and practicality of requiring dedication land, zoning regulations and compatibility with a comprehensive community development plan or a park and open space plan. 
(c)  Development of park area. When parklands are dedicated, the developer is required to: 
(1)  Properly grade and contour for proper drainage. 
(2)  Provide preliminary park plan view layout and surface contours suitable for anticipated use of area. 
(3)  Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of six inches of quality topsoil and fertilize, seed, and mulch, in accordance with approved city standard specifications. 
(4)  Completion of the parklands shall be concurrent with completion of the plat and related construction. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to maintain the area until grass is established and the city accepts the dedication. 
(d)  Park fees. 
(1)  Determination. New developments, in any zoning district within the city, for residential purposes, where the plan commission has not required parkland dedication, shall pay a park fee to the city based on the parkland dedication and park improvement value that would have been completed. 
(2)  Payment. Park fees shall be paid to the city prior to the time the certified survey or final plat map is to be recorded. Park fees shall be used for park development and improvement within the city in any manner deemed appropriate by the common council.

Sec. 74-32. - Imposition of room tax. 
(a)  Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0615, a tax is hereby imposed on the privilege and service of furnishing, at retail except sales for resale of rooms or lodging to transients by hotel keepers, motel operators and other persons furnishing accommodations that are available to the public, irrespective of whether membership is required for the use of the accommodations. Such tax shall be at the rate of six percent of the gross receipts from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodging. Such tax shall not be subject to the selective sales tax imposed by Wis. Stats. § 77.52(2). The proceeds of such tax shall be remitted monthly to the city treasurer. 
(b)  Out of the tax collected, two percent of the collected tax shall be returned to the hotel/motel owners to compensate for their work in collecting the tax; two percent of the total collected tax shall go to the city for administrative purposes; 96 percent of the total collected tax shall be paid into the general fund to be administered by the tourism promotion committee for tourism promotion. The tourism promotion committee shall prepare a budget and shall submit it to the finance/administration committee during budget time for approval. The due date of tax returns to be filed under this article shall be May 30 of each year and shall report the period of May 1 to April 30 preceding the due date. 
(c)  (1)  This article shall be administered by the city treasurer. The tax shall be payable monthly and shall be due on the last day of the month next succeeding the calendar month for which imposed. A return shall be filed with the city treasurer by those furnishing at retail such rooms and lodging on or before the same date on which such tax is due and payable. Such return shall show the gross room receipts of the preceding calendar month from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodging, the amount of taxes imposed for such period, and such other information as the city treasurer deems necessary. Every person required to file such monthly return shall, with his first return, elect to file an annual calendar year or fiscal year return. Such annual return shall be filed within 90 days of the close of each calendar or fiscal year. If, in the owner's/manager's judgment, the anticipated yearly payment will be $200.00 or less, he may request from the city treasurer an exemption from the monthly report and make the total payment at the time of the annual report. 
(2)  The annual return shall summarize the monthly returns, reconcile and adjust for errors in the monthly returns, and shall contain certain such additional information as the city treasurer requires. Such annual returns shall be signed by the person required to file a return or his duly authorized agent, but need not be verified by oath. The city treasurer may, for good cause, extend the time of filing any return, but in no event longer than one month from the filing date. 
(d)  Every person furnishing rooms or lodging under subsection (a) of this section shall file with the city clerk an application for a permit for each place of business. Every application for a permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the city clerk. At the time of making an application, the applicant shall pay the city treasurer a fee required by the official fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office. 
(e)  After compliance with subsections (f) and (m) of this section by the applicant, the city clerk shall grant and issue to each applicant a separate permit for each place of business within the city. Such permit is not assignable and is valid only for the person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated therein. It shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which issued. 
(f)  When any person fails to comply with this section, the city clerk may, upon ten days' notification and after affording such person the opportunity to show cause why his permit should not be revoked, revoke or suspend any or all of the permits held by such person. The city clerk shall give to such person written notice of the suspension or revocation of any of his permits. The city clerk shall not issue a new permit after the revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this section. A fee shall be imposed for the renewal or issuance of a permit which has been previously suspended or revoked. 
(g)  If any person liable for any amount of tax under this article sells out his business or stock of goods or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the city treasurer that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If a person subject to the tax imposed by this section fails to withhold such amount from the purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the price of the accommodations valued in money. 
(h)  The city treasurer may determine the tax required to be paid to the city or the refund due to any person under this section. The determination may be made upon the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or upon any other information within the city treasurer possession. The treasurer is authorized to examine and inspect the books, records, memoranda, and property of any person in order to verify the tax liability of that person or another person. Nothing herein shall prevent the city treasurer from making a determination of tax at any time. 
(i)  If any person fails to file a return as required by this article, the city treasurer shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts under subsection (a) of this section. Such estimate shall be made for the period from which such person failed to make a return and shall be based upon any information which is in the city treasurer's possession or may come into his possession. On the basis of this estimate, the city treasurer shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city, adding to the sum arrived at a penalty equal to ten percent thereof. One or more such determinations may be made for one or more periods. 
(j)  All unpaid taxes under this section shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the due date of the return until the first day of the month following the month in which the tax is paid or deposited with the city treasurer. All refunded taxes shall bear interest at 12 percent per annum from the due date of the return until the first day of the month following the month in which said taxes are refunded. An extension of time within which to file a return shall not operate to extend the due date of the return for purposes of interest computation. If the city treasurer determines that any overpayment of tax has been made intentionally or by reason of carelessness or neglect, or if the tax which was overpaid was not accompanied by a complete return, he shall not allow any interest thereon. 
(k)  Delinquent tax returns shall be subject to a late filing fee indicated on the official city fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office. The tax imposed by this section shall become delinquent if not paid: 
(1)  In the case of a timely filed return, within 30 days after the due date of the return, or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension period if one has been granted. 
(2)  In the case of no return filed or a return filed late, by the due date of the return. 
(l)  If, due to negligence, no return is filed or a return is filed late, or an incorrect return is filed, the entire tax finally determined shall be subject to a penalty of ten percent of tax, exclusive of any interest or other penalties. If a person fails to file a return when due or files a false or fraudulent return with the intent in either case to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this section, a penalty of ten percent shall be added to the tax required to be paid, exclusive of interest and other penalties. 
(m)  In order to protect the revenue of the city, the city treasurer may require any person liable for the tax imposed by this section to place with him, before or after a permit is issued, such security, not in excess of $1,000.00 as the city treasurer determines. If any taxpayer fails or refuses to place such security, the city treasurer may refuse or revoke such permit. If any taxpayer is delinquent in the payment of the taxes imposed by this section, the city clerk may, upon ten days' notice, recover the taxes, interest and penalties from the security placed with the city treasurer by such taxpayer. No interest shall be paid or allowed by the city to any person for the deposit of such security. 
(n)  Every person liable for the tax imposed by this section shall keep or cause to be kept such records, invoices and other pertinent papers in such form as the city treasurer requires. 
(o)  All tax returns, schedules, exhibits, writings or audit reports relating to such returns on file with the city treasurer are deemed to be confidential, except the city treasurer may divulge their contents to the following, and no others: 
(1)  The person who filed the return. 
(2)  Officers, agents or employees of the Federal Internal Revenue Service or state department of revenue. 
(3)  Officers, employees or agents of the city as may be necessary to enforce collection. 
(p)  No person having an administrative duty under this article shall make known in any manner the business affairs, operations or information obtained by an investigation of records of any person on whom a tax is imposed by this section, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof set forth or disclosed in any return, or to permit any return or copy thereof to be seen or examined by any person, except as provided in subsection (o) of this section.

(Code 1990, § 9-1-49) 
Sec. 78-70. - Turning on water. 
    The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of the utility. When a plumber has completed a job, he must leave the water turned off. This does not prevent the plumber from testing the work. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-50) 
Sec. 78-71. - Failure to read meters. 
(a)  Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. 
(b)  If the meter is damaged or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-51) 
Sec. 78-72. - Stop boxes.

(c)  If a consumer fails to repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curbstop to point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the utility after notification has been served on the consumer by the utility, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-57) 
Sec. 78-76. - Inspection of premises. 
    During reasonable hours, any officer or authorized employee of the utility shall have the right of access to the premises supplied with service, for the purpose of inspection or for the enforcement of the utility's rules and regulations. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-59) 
Sec. 78-77. - Customer's deposits. 
(a)  New residential service. The utility may require a cash deposit or other guarantee as a condition of new residential service if, and only if, the customer has an outstanding account balance with the utility which accrued within the last six years, and which at the time of the request for new service remains outstanding and not in dispute. 
(b)  Existing residential service. The utility may require a cash deposit or other guarantee as a condition of continued service if, and only if, either or both of the following circumstances apply: 
(1)  Service has been shut off or discontinued within the last 12 months for violation of these rules and regulations or for nonpayment of a delinquent bill for service which is not in dispute. 
(2)  Credit information obtained by the company subsequent to the initial application indicates that the initial application for service was falsified or incomplete to the extent that a deposit would be required under these rules and regulations. 
(c)  Commercial and industrial service. If the credit for an applicant for commercial or industrial service has not been established to the satisfaction of the utility, he may be required to make a deposit or otherwise guarantee to the utility payment of bills for service. 
(d)  Conditions of deposit. See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.36(4) for conditions of deposit. 
(e)  Refund of deposits. The utility shall review the payment record of each residential customer with a deposit on file at not less than 12-month intervals and shall not require or continue to require a deposit unless a deposit could be required under the conditions stated above. In the case of a commercial or industrial customer, the utility shall refund the deposit after 24 consecutive months of prompt payment if the customer's credit standing is satisfactory to the company. Payment shall be considered "prompt" if it is made prior to notice of disconnection for nonpayment of a bill not in dispute. Any deposit or portion thereof refunded to a customer shall be refunded by check unless both the customer and the company agree to credit the regular bill or unless service is terminated, in which case the deposit with accrued interest shall be applied to the final bill and any balance returned to the customer promptly. 
(f)  Other conditions. A new or additional deposit may be required upon reasonable written notice of the need therefor if such new or additional deposit could have been required under the circumstances when the initial deposit was made. Service may be refused or disconnected for failure to pay a deposit request as provided in the rules. When service has been disconnected for failure to make a deposit, or for failure to pay a delinquent bill, or for failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement, and satisfactory arrangements have been made to have service restored, a reconnection charge as specified elsewhere in these rules shall be paid by the customer as a condition to restoration of service. 
(g)  Guarantee contracts. 
(1)  The utility may accept, in lieu of a cash deposit, a contract signed by a guarantor satisfactory to the company, whereby payment of a specified sum not exceeding the cash deposit requirement is guaranteed. The term of a guarantee contract shall be two years, but shall automatically terminate after the customer has closed his account, or at the guarantor's request upon 30 days' written notice to the utility. 
(2)  Upon termination of a guarantee contract or whenever the company deems same insufficient as to amount or surety, a cash deposit or a new or additional guarantee may be required upon reasonable written notice to the customer. Service to any customer who fails to comply with these requirements may be refused, or upon eight days' written notice, disconnected. 
(3)  The utility shall mail the guarantor copies of all disconnect notices sent to the customer whose account he has guaranteed unless the guarantor waives such notice in writing. 
(4)  In lieu of a cash deposit or guarantee, an applicant for new service who has an outstanding account accrued within the last six years with the utility shall have the right to receive service from the company under a deferred payment agreement as provided in these rules and regulations for the outstanding account balance. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-60) 
Sec. 78-78. - Disconnection and refusal of service. 
(a)  Reasons for disconnection. Service may be disconnected or refused for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to pay a delinquent account or failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement. 
(2)  Violation of the utility's rules and regulations pertaining to the use of service in a manner which interferes with the service of others or to the operation of nonstandard equipment, if the customer has first been notified and provided with reasonable opportunity to remedy the situation. 
(3)  Failure to comply with deposit or guarantee arrangements as provided for in these rules and regulations. 
(4)  Diversion of service around the meter. 
(b)  Disconnection for delinquent accounts. 
(1)  A bill for service is delinquent if unpaid after the due date shown on the bill. The utility may disconnect service for a delinquent bill by giving the customer at least eight calendar days prior to disconnection, a written disconnect notice which may be included with the bill for service. For purposes of this rule, the due date shall not be less than 20 days after issuance. 
(2)  The utility may disconnect without notice where a dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any customer for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of the rules and regulations of the public service commission or of these rules and regulations, or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the customer's premises. 
(3)  The utility shall notify the county department of health and social services at least five calendar days prior to any scheduled disconnection of residential service if the customer or responsible person has made a written request for this procedure. The utility shall apprise customers of this right upon application for service. If service to a residential customer which has been disconnected has not been restored within 24 hours after disconnection, the utility shall notify the appropriate county sheriff's department of the billing name and service address and that a threat to health and life might exist to persons occupying the premises. 
(c)  Deferred payment agreement. 
(1)  The utility shall offer deferred payment agreements to residential customers. The deferred payment agreement shall provide that service will not be discontinued for the outstanding bill if the customer pays a stated reasonable amount of the outstanding bill and agrees to pay a stated reasonable portion of the remaining outstanding balance in installments until the bill is paid. In determining what amounts are "reasonable," the parties shall consider the: 
a.  Size of the delinquent account. 
b.  Customer's ability to pay. 
c.  Customer's payment history. 
d.  Time that the debt has been outstanding. 
e.  Reasons why the debt has been outstanding. 
f.  Any other relevant factors concerning the circumstances of the customer. 
(2)  In the deferred payment agreement it shall state immediately preceding the space provided for the customer's signature and in boldface print at least two sizes larger than any other used thereon, the following: 
"If you are not satisfied with this agreement, do not sign. If you do sign this agreement you give up your right to dispute the amount due under the agreement except for the utility's failure or refusal to follow the terms of this agreement." 
(3)  A deferred payment agreement shall not include a finance charge. 
(4)  If an applicant for service has not fulfilled the terms of a deferred payment agreement, the utility shall have the right to disconnect service or refuse service in accordance with these rules and under such circumstances, and it shall not be required to offer subsequent negotiation of a deferred payment agreement prior to disconnection. 
(5)  Any payments made by the customer in compliance with a deferred payment agreement, or otherwise, shall be first considered made in payment of the previous account balance with any remainder credited to the current bill. 
(d)  Dispute procedures. 
(1)  Whenever the customer advises the utility's designated office prior to the disconnection of service that all or part of any billing as rendered is in dispute, or that any matter related to the disconnection is in dispute, the company shall investigate the dispute promptly and completely, advise the customer of the results of the investigation, attempt to resolve the dispute, and provide the opportunity for the customer to enter in to a deferred payment agreement when applicable in order to settle the dispute. 
(2)  After the customer has pursued the available remedies with the utility, he may request that the public service commission's staff informally review the disputed issue and recommend terms of settlement. 
(3)  Any party to the dispute after informal review may make a written request for a formal review by the public service commission. If the public service commission decides to conduct a formal hearing on the dispute, the customer must pay 50 percent of the bill in dispute or post a bond for that amount on or before the hearing date. Failure to pay the amount or post the bond will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Service shall not be disconnected because of any disputed matter while the disputed matter is being pursued under the disputes procedure. In no way does this relieve the customer form the obligation of paying charges which are not disputed. 
(4)  The form of disconnection notice to be used is on file in the city clerk's office and the water utility office. 
(Code 1990, § 9-1-61)

(16)  Common recreational facilities. 
(a)  No less than ten percent of the total area of any mobile home community established under these regulations shall be devoted to common recreational areas and facilities, such as playgrounds, swimming pools, community buildings, ways for pedestrians and cyclists away from streets and play areas for small children for other recreational areas in block interiors. At least one principal recreation and community area shall contain not less than five percent of the total area of the community. 
(b)  To be countable as common recreational area, interior-block ways for pedestrians or cyclists shall form part of a system leading to principal destinations. Such ways may also be used for installations of utilities. 
(c)  Common recreational area shall not include streets, parking areas, floodplains, wetlands, or steep slopes, and shall be closed to automotive traffic except for maintenance and service vehicles, and shall be improved and maintained for the uses intended. 
(17)  Standards for general site planning for mobile home communities. The following guides, standards and requirements shall apply in site planning for mobile home communities: 
(a)  Principal vehicular access points. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes and/or traffic dividers shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. In general, minor streets shall not be connected with streets outside the district in such a way as to encourage the use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic. No lot within the community shall have direct vehicular access to a street bordering the development. 
(b)  Access for pedestrians and cyclists. Access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving the community shall be by safe and convenient routes. Such ways need not be adjacent to or limited to the vicinity of vehicular access points. Where there are crossings of such ways and vehicular routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safety located, marked and controlled and where such ways are exposed to substantial vehicular traffic at edges of communities, safeguards may be required to prevent crossings except at designated points. Bicycle paths, if provided, shall be so related to the pedestrian way system that street crossings are combined. 
(c)  Protection of visibility. Automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians. At intersections of any streets, public or private, the provisions of article VII shall apply and are hereby adopted by reference. Where there is pedestrian or bicycle access from within the community to a street at its edges by paths or across yards or other open space without a barrier to prevent access to the street, no material impediment to visibility more than 21/2 feet above ground level shall be created or maintained within 25 feet of said street unless at least 25 feet from said access measured at right angles to the path. 
(d)  Pedestrians and bicyclists. Ways for pedestrians and/or cyclists in exterior yards. In any exterior yard, required or other, ways for pedestrian and/or cyclists may be permitted, if appropriately located, fenced or landscaped to prevent potential hazards arising from vehicular traffic on adjacent streets or other hazards and annoyances to users or to occupants of adjoining property. When otherwise in accord with the requirements concerning such ways set forth above, approved ways in such locations shall be counted as common recreation facilities and may also be used for utilities easements. 
(e)  Internal relationships. The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features. In particular: 
1.  Streets, drives and parking and service areas. Streets, drives and parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwellings and community facilities and for service and emergency vehicles, but streets shall not be so laid out as to encourage outside traffic to traverse the community, nor occupy more land than is required to provide access as indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the community into small blocks. In general, block size shall be the maximum consistent with use, the shape of the site and the convenience and safety of the occupants. 
2.  Vehicular access to streets. Vehicular access to streets from oft-street parking areas may be directed from dwellings if the street or portion of the street serves 50 units or less. Determination of units served shall be based on normal routes anticipated for traffic. Along streets or portions of streets serving more than 50 dwelling units, or constituting major routes to or around central facilities, access from parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel traffic conveniently, safely and in a manner that minimizes marginal traffic friction, and direct vehicular access from individual dwellings shall generally be prohibited. 
3.  Ways for pedestrians and cyclists; use by emergency, maintenance or service vehicles. 
a.  Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwellings, project facilities and principal off-street pedestrian destinations. Maximum walking distance in the open between dwelling units and related parking spaces, delivery areas and trash and garbage storage areas intended for use of occupants shall not exceed 100 feet. 
b.  Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children as play areas or routes to school, bus stops or other destinations shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contacts with normal automotive traffic. If an internal walkway system is provided, away from streets, bicycle paths shall be incorporated in the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on such walkways and shall be located and designated to provide safety and shall be appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. Ways for pedestrians and cyclists, appropriately located, designed and constructed may be combined with other easements and used by emergency, maintenance or service vehicle but shall not be used by other automotive traffic.

Sec. 90-38. - M-2 heavy industrial zoning district. 
(1)  Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit industrial and office development at an intensity which provides ample incentive for infill development and redevelopment of existing industrial areas. This district is designed to permit a wide variety of industrial uses, including certain uses which are permitted in no other zoning district because of their potential to create nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, development within this district shall take access from a collector or arterial street. It must be emphasized that this is not a district where virtually any land use is permitted, as all uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in article VII.

(1)  Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit high-quality industrial and office development focused toward the highway and interstate highway in a business park setting. Beyond a relatively high minimum landscape surface ratio, the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to indoor industrial activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors, and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. To ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, development within this district shall take access from a collector or arterial street.

ARTICLE III. - LAND USE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 90-50. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide detailed descriptions and regulations for land uses established in article II of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-51. - Regulation of allowable uses. 
    Permitted land uses for each zoning district are listed in Article II and summarized in the Table of Land Uses in section 90-52, below. Even if a land use may be indicated as permitted by right or requiring a conditional use permit in a particular district, such a land use may not necessarily be permitted or permissible on a property unless it can be located or implemented on it in full compliance with all of the applicable standards and regulations of this article, or unless an appropriate variance has been granted. 
(1)  Principal land uses permitted by right. Principal land uses listed as permitted by right are permitted per the land use requirements of this article; per the density, intensity, and bulk regulations of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay zoning districts; per all other applicable requirements of this chapter; and per any and all other applicable city, county, state, and federal regulations with jurisdiction over the property. 
(2)  Principal land uses permitted as conditional uses. Principal land uses permitted only with a conditional use permit may be permitted subject to all requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in (1), above, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use imposed as part of the conditional use permit process established in section 90-472. 
(3)  Accessory Land Uses. Permitted by right accessory land uses are allowed subject to the requirements and exemptions applicable to principal land uses permitted by right in (1), above. Accessory land uses allowed only with a conditional use permit are subject to all the requirements and exemptions applicable to principal land uses requiring a conditional use permit as listed in (2) above. Additional regulations applicable to accessory land uses include the following: 
(a)  Accessory uses or structures shall conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as specifically otherwise provided. 
(b)  No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot prior to establishment of an allowable principal structure, unless otherwise stated in this chapter. 
(c)  With the exception of drainage structures, accessory structures shall not be located between a principal building and a street frontage on the same lot, nor within any required front yard. 
(d)  In no instance shall an accessory structure, cellar, basement, tent, or recreational trailer be used as a residence. 
(e)  Placement restrictions for residential districts. An accessory use or structure in a residential district may be established subject to the following regulation: 
1.  Accessory buildings. No accessory building shall occupy any portion of the required front yard, and no accessory building shall occupy more than 30 percent of the required rear yard. Any accessory building, use or structure shall conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except that when an accessory building is located forward of the rear building line of the principal building it shall satisfy the same side yard requirements as the principal building. An accessory building shall not be nearer than ten feet to the principal structure unless the applicable building code regulations in regard to one hour fire-resistive construction are complied with. In no event can the accessory uses or structures be forward of the front line of the principal structure. 
(f)  Use restrictions for residential district. Accessory uses or structures in residential districts shall not involve the conduct of any business, trade or industry except for home occupations as defined herein and shall not be occupied as a dwelling unit. 
(g)  Reversed corner lots. When an accessory structure is located on the rear of a reversed corner lot, it shall not be located beyond the front yard required on the adjacent interior lot to the rear, nor nearer than three feet to the side line of the adjacent structure. 
(h)  Lawn accessories. Walks, drives, paved terraces and purely decorative garden accessories such as pools, fountains, statuary flag poles, etc., shall be permitted in setback areas but not closer than three feet to an abutting property line other than a street line. 
(i)  Retaining walls. Retaining walls may be permitted anywhere on the lot, provided, however, that no individual wall shall exceed six feet in height, and a terrace of at least three feet in width shall be provided between any series of such walls. 
(4)  Temporary land uses. Temporary uses are those uses that have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop under the general requirements of this chapter. Therefore, temporary uses are permitted on a temporary basis subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in (1) above. 
(5)  Classification of unlisted uses. Any use not specifically listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in the districts established in article II or the Table of Land Uses shall be considered prohibited except as may be otherwise specifically approved hereinafter. In case of question as to the classification of an unlisted use, the question shall require an interpretation per section 90-479.

This shall be accomplished through adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive entry throat length; design, location, and number of traffic control devices; and sidewalks. 
2.  Where the traffic impact analysis indicates that a project may cause off-site public roads, intersections, or interchanges to function below a level of service (LOS) C, the city may deny the application, require a size reduction in the proposed development, and/or require the developer to construct and/or pay for required off-site improvements to achieve a LOS C for a planning horizon of a minimum of ten years assuming full build-out of the development. 
3.  The city has the option to require a trip generation study. 
(d)  Economic and fiscal analysis. The city may require completion of an economic and fiscal impact analysis containing the following items: 
1.  Estimate to what extent the proposed project would reduce the proposed market area's economic base by eliminating existing businesses. 
2.  Compare and evaluate the projected costs and benefits to the community resulting from the project, including: 
a.  Projected costs arising from increased demand for and required improvements to public services and infrastructure. 
b.  Value of improvements to public services and infrastructure to be provided by the project. 
c.  Projected tax revenues to the city to be generated by the project in the first five years of business. 
d.  Projected impact of the project in the first five years on land values (both residential and nonresidential) and potential loss or increase in tax revenues to the City of Portage. 
(e)  Detailed neighborhood plan. For a development exceeding 80,000 square feet in total gross floor area of all combined buildings within the development, the city may require that a detailed neighborhood plan be submitted and approved by the plan commission and common council. The detailed neighborhood plan shall be prepared for all areas within 1,500 feet of the subject property, as measured from the outer perimeter of the subject property or group of properties proposed for development, and any other nearby lands as determined by the plan commission to be part of the defined neighborhood. The detailed neighborhood plan shall contain the following specific elements at a scale of not less than 1? = 400': 
1.  Land use with specific zoning districts and/or land uses. 
2.  Transitional treatments such as berms and/or landscaping between areas with differing land uses or character. 
3.  Complete transportation network, including pedestrian and bicycle facilities and transit routes and stops, where applicable. 
4.  Conceptual stormwater management facilities. 
5.  Proposed public facility sites, including parks, schools, conservation areas, public safety facilities and public utility facilities. 
6.  Proposed community character themes, including building materials, landscaping, streetscaping, and signage. 
7.  Demonstrate that the proposed detailed neighborhood plan is in harmony with the land use, multi-modal transportation, utility, stormwater management, community character provisions of the comprehensive plan. 
(f)  Policy on vacation of existing sites. Where any large development in excess of 40,000 square feet of floor area is vacated because the commercial use (sale of goods or merchandise at the building) conducted thereon is being relocated to a different building, the party that vacated the site shall not impose limits on the type of reuse of the vacated site through conditions of sale or lease. 
(g)  Additional requirements. All large developments are subject to the following additional requirements: 
1.  The developer shall enter into a development agreement with the city, which shall include the payment of all utilities including but not limited to stormwater, sanitary sewer, and street infrastructure. Off-site improvements may also be required as part of the development agreement. 
2.  Absolute building area cap. No individual building shall exceed a total of 155,000 square feet in gross floor area. This cap may not be exceeded by the granting of a planned development permit. 
3.  All buildings on outlots shall be of architectural quality comparable to the primary structure, as determined by the plan commission.

ARTICLE IV. - BULK REGULATIONS 

Sec. 90-70. - Purpose. 
    This article regulates the location and bulk of buildings and other structures in order to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and to enhance the desired community character of the City of Portage. ;hn0;(Ord. No. 13-005, ;s; 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-71. - Bulk standards. 
    All developments shall comply with the standards listed for each zoning district in article II. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-72. - Yard setback adjustments. 
(1)  Limitations on yard reductions or joint use. 
(a)  No lot, yard, parking area, building area, or other space shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to not meet the provisions required by this chapter. If an existing yard is less than the minimum required, it shall not be reduced further, except where exempted by the provisions of this section. 
(b)  No part of any lot, yard, parking area, or other space required for a structure or use shall be used for any other structure or use. 
(c)  No required yard or other space allocated to a structure or parcel of land shall be used to satisfy the minimum yard or lot area requirements for another structure or parcel. 
(2)  Front yard or street side setback adjustments. 
(a)  Building additions. Additions in the street yard of existing structures shall not project beyond the average of the existing street yards on the abutting lots or parcels. 
(b)  Average street yards. 
1.  The required street yards may be decreased in any residential or business districts to the average of the existing street yards of the abutting structures on each side but in no case less than 15 feet in any residential district. 
2.  In the R-T, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-MH, and B-1 districts, a front yard setback may be reduced to the average of the setbacks of the adjoining lots that are on both sides of the subject lot. The following rules apply in calculating the average setback (see Figure 90-72a): 
a.  Only the setbacks on five or fewer adjoining lots which are on the same side of the street as the subject lot may be used. 
b.  Where a lot is vacant, the minimum setback of the zoning district will be applied by the zoning administrator. 
c.  Outliers shall be excluded in calculating the average setback as determined by the zoning administrator. 
Figure 90-72(a): Calculating the Setback Average

(3)  Building setback adjustment on cul-de-sac lots. It is the objective of the city that buildings on cul-de-sacs be set back from the right-of-way at a consistent distance. This concern is particularly present where too-narrow lots force a substantially deeper minimum front yard setback. The following regulations address this concern: 
(a)  Proposed new lots on cul-de-sacs. For cul-de-sac lots platted after the effective date of this chapter, each cul-de-sac lot shall provide the minimum lot width at the minimum front yard setback. Where such a requirement is not met, one or more of the proposed cul-de-sac lots may have to be eliminated to meet this requirement. 
(b)  Existing narrow lots on cul-de-sacs. For cul-de-sac lots existing prior to the effective date of this chapter which do not meet the minimum lot width at the minimum front yard setback, the following adjustment is permitted: 
1.  The principal structure may be placed at of the minimum front yard setback if the following conditions are met (see Figure 90-72(b)): 
a.  The habitable area of the principal structure (and/or porch) may be set back at or more interior of the minimum required front yard setback without meeting the minimum lot requirement. 
b.  The garage must be set back at or more interior the minimum required front yard setback as determined by the minimum lot width requirement. 
c.  The minimum lot width, minimum side yard setback, and minimum pavement setback of the subject district shall be met. 
This approach is a way to provide for a uniform front yard setback around the cul-de-sac, provide more usable rear yards, and result in a more pleasing street appearance not dominated by forward-thrust garages. 
Figure 72(b): Existing Cul-de-Sac Lot Width Adjustment

  
(4)  Side and rear yard setback adjustments for bufferyards. In instances where the required bufferyard width (per article VIII) exceeds the minimum required setback width, the minimum required bufferyard width shall prevail. Absolutely no intrusions of a building, structure, or paved area are permitted within the required bufferyard. [NOTE - delete section if landscaping regulations are not] 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-73. - Obstructions and intrusions into required yards. 
    The minimum setback requirements of each zoning district shall establish the minimum required yards for all uses, except those exempted by the provisions of this section. 
(1)  Obstructions. Every part of the required area of a yard shall be open to the sky unobstructed, except for accessory buildings and the ordinary projections of sills, cornices and ornamental features. 
(2)  Intrusions. The following intrusions into required yards are permitted: 
(a)  Fire escapes which do not extend more than five feet into the required yard. 
(b)  An open terrace, deck, or uncovered porch may extend into the required setback for the front yard and/or rear yard a distance of six feet provided the floor is not higher than four feet above grade. 
(c)  Stairs, steps, or stoops four feet or less above grade which are necessary for access to a permitted building or for access to a zoning lot from a street or alley. 
(d)  Awnings and canopies may extend into the required yard a distance not to exceed four feet. 
(e)  Chimneys, provided they do not extend more than two feet into a required yard. 
(f)  Recreational equipment. 
(g)  Clotheslines and other similar laundry drying equipment. 
(h)  Overhanging eaves and gutters projecting into the yard for a distance not exceeding 40 percent of the required yard width or three feet or whichever is less. 
(i)  Essential services, utilities, electric power and communication transmission lines are exempt from the yard and distance requirements of this chapter. 
(j)  Chimneys, flues, sills, pilasters, lintels, ornamental features, cornices, eaves, bay windows, and gutters for residential buildings, provided they do not extend more than two feet into the required yard. 
(k)  Fences may locate on the property line. Permitted fence types shall comply with the provisions of section 90-121. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-74. - Exceptions to maximum height regulations. 
    The maximum height regulations stipulated in article II may be exceeded, but such modification shall be in accord with the following: 
(1)  Architectural projections, such as spires, belfries, parapet walls, cupolas, domes, flues and chimneys, are exempt from the height limitations of this Chapter. 
(2)  Special structures, such as elevator penthouses, gas tanks, grain elevators, scenery lots, radio and television receiving antennas, manufacturing equipment and necessary mechanical appurtenances, cooling towers, fire towers, substations and smoke stacks, are exempt from the height limitations of this chapter. 
(3)  Essential services, utilities, water towers, electric power and communication transmission lines are exempt from the height limitations of this chapter. 
(4)  Communication structures, such as radio and television transmission and relay towers, aerials and observation towers, shall not exceed in height three times their distance from the nearest lot line. 
(5)  Public or semipublic facilities, such as schools, churches, hospitals, monuments, sanitariums, libraries, governmental offices and stations, are increased not less than one foot for each foot the structure exceeds the district's maximum height requirement. 
(6)  Agricultural structures such as barns and silos shall not exceed in height twice their distance from the nearest lot line. 
(7)  Any building or structure not otherwise accounted for by (1) through (6) above may exceed maximum height regulations with the granting of a conditional use permit that specifically states the maximum permitted height of the proposed building or structure.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 

Sec. 90-80. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish regulations for nonconforming uses, substandard lots, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming sites created legally prior to the effective date of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-81. - Nonconforming uses. 
    A nonconforming use is an active or actual use of land or structures, or both; legally established prior to the effective date of this chapter or subsequent applicable amendment thereto which has continued the same use to the present, and which would not be permitted under the current terms of this chapter. 
(1)  Continuance of a nonconforming use. 
(a)  Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter or any amendment to it may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as specified in this section. 
(b)  Any prior legal use made nonconforming by this chapter, by an amendment to it, or by a modification to the official zoning map, may be granted full legal conforming status by the issuance of a conditional use permit, subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by section 90-472/. 
(2)  Uses made nonconforming by this chapter. 
(a)  A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, either permitted by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of this chapter, shall be considered a legal, conforming land use so long as any previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall require application and consideration under the requirements of sections 90-81(1) and/or 90-81(3). 
(3)  Modification of a nonconforming use. 
(a)  A nonconforming use shall not be altered by expansion, enlargement, extension, or reconstruction, unless a conditional use permit is granted for such alteration, subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by section 90-472, or unless a zoning amendment is granted under the requirements of section 90-471. 
(b)  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, unless the nonconforming use receives a variance to change to a more restrictive, nonconforming use, pursuant to section 90-465(2)(d). 
(c)  A nonconforming nonresidential use not served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if either or both facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject property, and a conditional use permit is granted for such expansion. 
(4)  Discontinuance. When any nonconforming use of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of said structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013; Ord. No. 17-001, 1-26-2017) 
Sec. 90-82. - Nonconforming or substandard lots. 
(1)  Blanket conforming status. 
(a)  Blanket conforming status of any and all requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all nonconforming or substandard lots in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this chapter. This subsection ensures that lots approved and created prior to the adoption of this chapter do not encounter difficulty because the lots would otherwise be considered nonconforming or substandard. 
(b)  After the effective date of this chapter, no existing lot area shall be reduced so as to create a lot of less than the required size or so that the existing setbacks, lot area, or minimum width would be reduced below that required by the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
(2)  Residential substandard lots. 
(a)  If an existing lot of record in a residential zoning district does not meet the area, width, and frontage requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, the lot may be utilized for a detached single family dwelling, provided that all of the district requirements are complied with insofar as is practical but shall not be less than the following: 
Minimum Lot Width 30 feet Minimum Lot Area 4,000 square feet Minimum Building Area 1,000 square feet Maximum Building Height 30 feet Minimum Front or Street Setback 25 feet; 
On corner lots, the second street setback shall be not less than 10 feet Minimum Rear Setback 25 feet Minimum Side Setback 16 percent of the frontage, but not less than 5 feet  
(b)  If an existing lot of record in a multi-family residential zoning district (i.e. R-4 and R-5), does not meet the area, width, and frontage requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, the lot may be utilized for a multifamily structure and its accessory structures provided the following setback requirements, provided that all other requirements set forth in the R-4 or R-5 district are complied with: 
Minimum Front or Street 10 feet; 
On corner lots, the side street yard shall not be less than 10 feet Minimum Rear Setback 10 feet Minimum Side Setback 10 feet  
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-83. - Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Blanket conforming status. Blanket conforming status of any and all requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all nonconforming structures lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter. Such structures may be permitted to continue in the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as provided in this section. 
(2)  Structure made nonconforming by this chapter. Any structure lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, but that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, such as but not limited to height, setback, access provisions, shall be considered a legal, conforming structure so long as any previously approved conditions of approval are followed. 
(3)  Modification. 
(a)  Any lawful nonconforming structure may be altered by extension, enlargement, or reconstruction, provided that said alteration complies with the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(b)  The nonconforming feature of said structure shall not be allowed to become more nonconforming by alteration except under one of more of the following situations: 
1.  As when required to do so by law or order. 
2.  To comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  With approval of a conditional use permit by the plan commission for the purpose of making required structural alterations to maintain the structural integrity of the building. 
4.  With the approval of a variance by the board of zoning appeals. 
(c)  Nonconforming residential structures may be altered provided such alteration does not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a conforming garage may be added if none previously existed. 
(d)  When any lawful nonconforming structure in any district is modified so as to be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, any future modification of said structure shall also be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Restoration. A damaged or destroyed nonconforming structure may be restored to the size, location, and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, without any limits on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or improvement if the nonconforming structure was damaged by fire, flood, wind, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, unlawful act, or Act of God on or after the effective date of this chapter. 
(5)  Unsafe structures. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the building inspector or any other city official from initiating remedial or enforcement actions when alawful nonconforming structure is declared unsafe or presents a danger the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(6)  Ordinary maintenance. Ordinary maintenance and repairs of a nonconforming structure, including remodeling, shall be permitted, as well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconforming structure. Ordinary maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and external painting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the installation of heating, electricity, plumbing, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other non-structural components. 
(7)  Timing of building permit. Any structure for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this chapter or an amendment to it which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this chapter or that amendment thereto, may be completed in accordance with approved plans, provided construction is started within 365 calendar days after issuance of the permit and construction is completed within 730 calendar days (2 years) after the start of construction. If all such conditions are met, the structure shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-84. - Nonconforming sites. 
(1)  Purpose. This section is intended to prevent the creation of nonconforming sites related to the building and site design requirements of this chapter. These site design components may include one or more of the following: 
(a)  Site design or building materials requirements. 
(b)  Parking, loading, access drive and other paved area design requirements. 
(c)  Landscaping or bufferyard requirements. 
(d)  Fencing requirements. 
(e)  Lighting requirements. 
(2)  Blanket conforming status. Blanket conforming status for any and all requirements of this chapter is hereby automatically granted to all development sites in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this chapter. This subsection ensures that sites approved prior to the adoption of this chapter do not encounter difficulty because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming. 
(3)  Modification. 
(a)  Alterations, such as enlargements, expansions, or extensions that would result in creation of one or more nonconformities, increase the degree of the existing nonconformity(ies), or render a nonconforming site incapable of being brought into full or greater compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be permitted unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals under section 90-478. 
(b)  On lots where the site configuration is sufficient to comply with the site design requirements of this chapter (such as minimum paved surface setback and minimum landscape surface ratio), no alteration (i.e., enlargement, expansion, or extension of a use or structure) shall be permitted if it makes compliance with site regulations of this chapter impossible, even if said alteration would otherwise be permissible. 
(4)  Required compliance of nonconforming sites. 
(a)  On lots where the site configuration is adequate to enable full compliance with all site design requirements of this chapter, full or partial compliance, as determined by the plan commission, shall be required at the time of any installation of property improvement requiring and having received site plan approval. 
(b)  On lots where the site configuration is insufficient to enable full compliance with all site design requirements but nevertheless provides space to reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities, the plan commission shall make a determination as to the manner and degree to which nonconformities shall be brought into conformance.

ARTICLE VI. - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS 

Sec. 90-90. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish overlay zoning districts wherein certain additional requirements are superimposed on the underlying standard zoning districts set forth in article II of this chapter. Each overlay district is intended to address a special land use circumstance beyond those addressed by the underlying standard zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-91. - How to use this article. 
    A given property may lie within one or more overlay zoning district based on its geographic location. The provisions of this article are intended to be consulted before issuance of any building permit, site plan approval, conditional use permit, zoning permit, zoning change, or land division to ensure the intended use meets all of the requirements of any applicable overlay district, in addition to the underlying standard zoning. For each overlay district established in this article, a definition of the resource or geographic area is provided, followed by the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing the resource or geographic location, the method of delineating the boundaries of the overlay district, and the mandatory development regulations. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-92. - Overlay zoning districts. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following overlay zoning districts are hereby established. 
Floodplain Zoning (see article IX) 
Shoreland-Wetland Zoning (see section 90-93) 
PD Planned Development Overlay District (see section 90-94) 
Historic Preservation (see section 90-95) 
C-1 Resource Conservation Overlay District (see section 90-96) 
M-W Municipal Well Recharge Area Overlay District (see section 90-97) 
S-B Sexually Oriented Business Overlay District (see Section 90-98) 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-93. - Shoreland wetland zoning. 
(1)  Statutory authorization. This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26. 
(2)  Findings of fact. 
(a)  Generally. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and impair the tax base. The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
(b)  Purpose. To promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, this article has been established to: 
1.  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; 
2.  Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters and to maintain stormwater and floodwater capacity; 
3.  Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
4.  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
5.  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
(3)  Title of this section. The title of this section shall be the shoreland-wetland zoning ordinance/section for the city. 
(4)  Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the city shall be in full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see section 90-81 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this article. 
(5)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, town and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the state department of transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
(6)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a)  This section supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this section, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. 
(7)  Interpretation.

(b)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for the final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(c)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If the department staff concurs with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

Sec. 90-94. - PD planned development overlay district. 
    This district allows variations from the typical zoning district requirements in developments that are conceived and implemented as cohesive, unified projects. This district is intended to provide more incentives for redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of reinvestment, or which require flexible zoning treatment because of factors which are specific to the site. This district is designed to advance both aesthetic and economic objectives of the city by controlling the site design and the land use, appearance, density, or intensity of development within the district in a manner which is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and economic revitalization principles. The application of these standards will ensure long-term progress and broad participation toward these principles. Refer to section 90-475 for the procedures applicable to proposal review in this standard zoning district. The city also intends to use the planned development overlay district to provide a mechanism for review of traditional neighborhood developments per Wis. Stats. § 66.1027.

Sec. 90-98. - S-B sexually oriented business overlay district. 
(1)  Description and Purpose. The City of Portage, relying on the experience of other local governments in this state and throughout the country, finds as follows: 
(a)  That sexually oriented businesses may have an adverse secondary effect on the surrounding community because the sexual nature of the business may, regardless of the intentions of the proprietors, attract persons seeking prostitution or unlawful drugs, or who are inclined to be disorderly or disruptive. 
(b)  Sexually oriented businesses are typically intense commercial uses which create a large volume of foot and automobile traffic in the vicinity of the business, which may require police and other municipal services which may not be available in the townships surrounding the city. 
(c)  Sexually oriented businesses have their peak activity at hours and days which are incompatible with residential and most other commercial uses. 
(d)  Because of the potential for negative impacts on property values, the peace and good order of the city and the welfare of the individuals affected by sexually oriented businesses, it is necessary to minimize the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and assure that such establishments are not located in places which pose unacceptable conflicts with existing or planned land uses. 
(e)  It is the intent of this section to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and to further preserve the quality of family life and to preserve the urban and rural characteristics of its neighborhoods. 
(f)  The intent of the S-B sexually oriented business overlay district is solely to regulate the location of such establishments, not the content of any presentation or materials held for sale, rent, or loan. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the regulation of any activities conducted in sexually oriented businesses which are entitled to protection under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, including: 
1.  Plays, operas, musicals, or other dramatic works that are not obscene; 
2.  Classes, seminars, or lectures which are held for a serious scientific or educational purpose that are not obscene. 
3.  Whether or not an activity is obscene shall be judged by consideration of the following factors: 
a.  Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the activity, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex; 
b.  Whether the activity depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, as measured against community standards; and 
c.  Whether the activity, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
(2)  Definitions. 
(a)  A sexually oriented business shall be defined as any business that conducts any live performance that includes nudity and/or sexual activities or any business that devotes more than ten percent of its available floor, wall, and display space open to the public for sale, rent or loan of books, movies, novelties, or other item(s) that include any pictures, photographs, drawings, motion pictures films or similar visual representations or images of a person or portions of the human body which are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis on matters depicting, describing, or relating to sexual activities or nudity. 
(b)  Nudity shall mean the showing of any human genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, or anal cleft with less than a fully opaque covering, the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the areola or nipple, or the showing of the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state. 
(c)  Sexual activities shall mean the fondling of another person's genitals, pubic region, anus or female breasts; actual or implied sex acts including intercourse, oral copulation, masturbation or sodomy; or any sexual acts prohibited by Wisconsin Statutes. 
(3)  Overlay District. The overlay district shall apply only to those lands in the City of Portage zoned A-I agricultural district, lying south of the Wisconsin River and/or south and east of Ontario Street. 
(4)  Permitted Use. A sexually oriented business shall be a permitted use within the overlay district. 
(5)  Siting Standards. Sexually oriented businesses shall meet all of the following requirements: 
(a)  No sexually oriented business may be located within 1,000 feet, as measured from nearest front door to nearest front door, from any church, synagogue, temple, mosque or other place of worship, residentially zoned district, residential use regardless of zoning, school, day care center, public library, and other sexually oriented business or within 1,000 feet, as measured from the front door to the closest property boundary of a park, playground, or interstate highway. 
(b)  There shall be no display windows on the premises. 
(c)  The exterior building appearance and signage shall be designed to ensure that the use does not detract from the ability of businesses in the vicinity to attract customers, nor affect the marketability of properties in the vicinity for sale at their assessed values. 
(d)  The business may have only one non-flashing business sign, which must be on the premises occupied by the business, may only indicate the name of the business and identify it as a sexually oriented business and shall be no larger than four feet by four feet. 
(e)  A one square foot sign shall be placed on each public entrance which shall state "Admittance to adults only" and may include other pertinent business information. 
(f)  The owner and operator of a sexually oriented business shall agree to comply with all federal, state, and local laws and ordinances, including those regulating obscenity and alcoholic beverages, and shall further insure that minors are not allowed on the premises; 
(g)  There shall be no areas in a sexually oriented business where entertainment is provided which are not fully visible from the main area of the establishment (i.e., there shall be no areas set off by doors, curtains, screens, barriers, café, saloon doors, or other obstructions where entertainment is provided). 
(h)  Minimum required parking: One space per 300 square feet of gross floor area, or one space per person at the maximum capacity of the establishment (whichever is greater). 
(i)  Severability. The provisions of this section shall be severable if so determined by the Common Council.

(Ord. No. 13-005, 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-143. - Landscaping requirements. 
(1)  Provision of landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided based on the following requirements for building foundations, street frontages, paved areas, general yard areas, and bufferyards. These requirements are additive to each other and any other landscaping or screening requirements in this chapter. Credit for existing landscape plantings that are retained and protected with the development of the site, and for restoration or reestablishment of native flora, shall be allowed. In calculating the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this section, all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet. Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this section (for example: 23.3 canopy trees) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole plant (for example: 24 canopy trees). 
(2)  Building foundations. 
(a)  For each 100 feet of building foundation perimeter, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 90-143(a). 
(b)  Foundation landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the building foundation. Such landscaping shall not be located in areas required for street frontage, paved areas, general yard areas, bufferyards, or other green space areas. 
(c)  Shade trees and tall trees shall not be used to meet the foundation landscaping requirement. 
(d)  If the officially approved site plan depicts a future building extension, the foundation landscaping requirement shall be calculated by measuring the length of the total perimeter of the building, including extension. However, foundation plantings need only be installed for portion of the building for which a building permit has been issued. 
(3)  Street frontages. 
(a)  For every 100 linear feet of street frontage of a developed lot abutting a public street right-of-way, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 90-143(a). 
(b)  All landscaping used to meet street frontage requirements shall be located within 10 feet of the public right-of-way. Under no circumstances shall such landscaping be located within a public right-of-way. Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. 
(c)  Shrubs shall not be used to meet street frontage landscaping requirements. A minimum of 50 percent of all points shall be devoted to climax or tall trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum of 30 percent of all points shall be devoted to medium trees. 
(d)  Under no circumstances shall such landscaping be located within a public right-of-way. Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. 
(e)  For all lots not meeting the requirements of this subsection as of the effective date of this chapter, the following shall apply: 
1.  For additions to floor area, landscaping installed shall be equal to the percent increase in new floor area. New floor area shall be defined as the square footage of the addition divided by the square footage of the existing building. 
2.  For additions to paved areas, landscaping installed shall be equal to the percent increase in new paved area. New paved area shall be defined as the square footage of the addition divided by the square footage of the existing paved area. 
(4)  Paved areas. 
(a)  For every 20 off-street parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of pavement (whichever yields the greater landscaping requirement), landscaping shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 90-143(a). 
(b)  Landscaping shall be located within 10 feet of the paved area. Said area does not have to be provided in one contiguous area. Plants used to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking, loading and circulation areas from view from public streets. 
(c)  A minimum of 30 percent of all points shall be devoted to climax or tall trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum of 40 percent of all points shall be devoted to shrubs. 
(d)  Parking lot design. 
1.  Landscaped medians shall be used to break large parking areas into distinct pods, with a maximum of 100 spaces in any one pod. 
2.  Parking spaces must be broken by a tree island at the rate of one island for each linear row of 12 parking spaces for single-row or peninsula configurations, or for each 24 parking spaces in double row configurations. 
3.  All tree islands and landscaped areas with trees shall have a minimum of nine feet as measured from outside the curb or frame. 
4.  All landscaped areas without trees, but planted with shrubs, shall have a minimum width of three feet measured from inside the curb or frame. 
(5)  Yard areas. An additional 200 landscaping points shall be provided for each acre or portion thereof of total lot area. Landscaping required by this standard shall be placed where appropriate on the site, but generally in those areas not covered by other provisions of this section. 
(6)  Bufferyards. A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances (e.g. dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings, or parking areas). 
(a)  Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another. Bufferyards are not be required in front or street side yards. 
(b)  Required opacity. 
1.  Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property. The required level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts. 
2.  Figure 90-143(b) shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard. The required level of opacity is the value given in the cell of the table at which the row (representing the subject property's zoning district) intersects with the column (representing the adjacent property's zoning district). The value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property. 
3.  Figure 90-143(c) provides details to meet opacity requirements listed in subsection 2., above. 
(7)  Other green space areas. Green space areas not used for landscape plantings other than natural resource protection areas shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable seed mix, restored to native vegetation, or maintained in crop production if approved by the plan commission. Mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable provided that such mulching consists of organic or natural materials. Mulches shall be installed so that they will not erode, fall, be plowed or otherwise transported into walks, drives, streets or other hard surfaced portions of the site.

For example, if a landscaping plan includes a total of 20 tall deciduous trees, no more than one of those 20 trees may be classified as a "species to use sparingly." The purpose of this provision is to encourage plant species diversity throughout the city. 
  2 Species to avoid may not be included as contributing landscaping points as part of any landscaping plan that is subject to city review. The purpose of this provision is to limit the planting of species that are invasive, have invasive tendencies, or that may perpetuate or spread disease.

Sec. 90-145. - Standards for rain gardens and bioswales. 
(1)  Definitions. 
(a)  Rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site, where appropriately designed and sited. A rain garden is a shallow, depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground. Rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff. A well designed and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for a development site. 
(b)  A bioswale is a linear, vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate form sewer inlets or other management facilities. The flow of water being conveyed through a bioswale is slowed down, allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or off-site. Water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it, generally improving both ground and surface water quality. 
(2)  Requirements. 
(a)  The installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for a development site and count toward meeting the City's landscaping guidelines. Rain gardens may count for 20 points for every 20 square feet for yard area, building foundation, and/or paved area requirements, provided the following requirements are met. 
(b)  Detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden or bioswale including length, width, depth, and slope of depression; location of the rain garden or bioswale on the lot relative to hard-surfaced areas, downspouts, and site topography; characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale; description of planting media; the species, number, and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for the rain garden or bioswale; and information on any other materials (e.g., rocks) that will be used to line the rain garden or bioswale. 
(c)  Installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site: 
1.  Areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale is proposed to be constructed with an under-drain; 
2.  Areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground; or 
3.  Areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic. 
(d)  The owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale shall be properly maintained; kept free of trash, weeds, debris, and dead or dying plants; any pipes associated with the rain garden or bioswale will be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris; and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials will be cut back or removed. 
(e)  Bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously (and appropriately) vegetated to qualify for landscaping points. Bioswales and rain gardens (or portions thereof) that are lined with turf and/or rocks but do not include other vegetation will not county toward meeting landscaping point requirements. 
(f)  Rain gardens and bioswales may serve as a component of an overall stormwater management plan for a site only if detailed plans, calculations, and specifications are submitted. Detailed plans shall include the location and description of all other stormwater management facilities serving the site, particularly those to which any bioswale will be directed. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-146. - Landscaping installation requirements. 
(1)  Installation. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this chapter shall be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan within 365 days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property, unless a conditional use is approved to allow for greater than 365 days. 
(2)  Surety. 
(a)  If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the installation of all required landscaping and bufferyard material, the property owner shall sign an instrument agreeing to install the landscaping within the 730-day period and shall furnish to the city an irrevocable letter of credit or other form of security acceptable to the city sufficient to guarantee completion of the work. Such security shall be provided by the property owner at the time that the agreement is signed. It shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated actual cost for all of the required elements of the approved site plan and shall specifically guarantee that all such elements shall be made and installed according to the approved site plan. The costs of the work shall be furnished by the property and shall be verified by the city. The financial security shall remain in force until all of the work has been completed and approved by the city. This agreement shall also contain a statement indicating that the property owner's failure to comply with the requirements of the terms of the agreement will constitute a violation of the chapter and subject the property owner to a forfeiture upon conviction. 
(b)  If the required landscaping and bufferyard materials are to be installed during different phases of a subdivision development, the developer may furnish for each phase financial security in an amount sufficient to guarantee completion of the landscaping and bufferyard work performed during a particular phase, unless the Land Division Regulations requires otherwise. 
(c)  If the property owner is a governmental unit, it may, in lieu of signing an agreement and furnishing a guarantee and file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in its behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this article. 
(3)  If existing plant material meets the requirements of this article and will be preserved on the subject property following the completion of development, it may be counted as contributing to the landscaping requirements. 
(4)  All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless such vegetation is already fully established. 
(5)  The exact placement of plants and structures shall be depicted on the required detailed landscaping plan submitted to the city for its approval. Such plant and structure location shall be the decision of each property owner provided the following requirements are met: 
(a)  Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters to maximize their chance for survival. 
(b)  Where a combination of plant materials, berming, and fencing is used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward the interior of the subject property and the plant material shall be located toward the exterior of the subject property. 
(c)  A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the register of deeds that an adjacent property owner agrees to provide on the immediately adjacent portion of his or her land a partial or full portion of the required bufferyard, thereby relieving the developer of the responsibility of providing the entire bufferyard on his property. 
(d)  Under no circumstance shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected or located in a manner resulting in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard. 
(e)  The restrictions on types of plants listed in this article shall apply. 
(6)  Maintenance. The continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall be a requirement of this chapter and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials and plants are required. This requirement shall run with the property and shall be binding upon all future property owners. Development of any or all property following the effective date of this chapter shall constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If the property owner fails to comply with these provisions, the City may enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating and maintaining all required landscaping and bufferyard materials, and may specially assess the costs thereof against the property. A property owner's failure to comply with this requirement shall also be considered a violation of this chapter, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement procedures and penalties. 
(7)  Use of Required Bufferyard and Landscaped Areas. Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails provided that no required material is eliminated; the total width of the required bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is maintained; and all other regulations of this chapter are met. However, in such areas, no swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, or other such similar active recreational uses. No parking and no outdoor display of storage of materials shall be permitted. Paving in such areas shall be limited to that required for necessary access to, through, or across the subject property. 
(8)  Utility easements. Landscaping materials, fences and berms located within a duly recorded utility or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a landscaping requirement, unless authorized otherwise by a conditional use permit. However, the width of such areas may be counted as part of a landscaping requirement.

(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-274. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Portage, Wisconsin." 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-275. - General provisions. 
(1)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(2)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see s. 90-431 Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Portage Zoning Administrator, 115 W. Pleasant St., Portage, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(a)  Official maps: Based on the FIS: 
1.  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55021C0234F, 55021C0242G, 55021C0253F, 55021C0254F, 55021C0258F, 55021C0261G, 55021C0262F, 55021C0263G, 55021C0264G, 55021C0266F, 55021C0268F dated 5/16/2016; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated 5/16/2016, volume numbers 55021CV001C, 55021CV002C. 
(b)  Official maps: Based on other studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development. 
(3)  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
(a)  The floodway district (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(b)  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
(c)  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
(4)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subd (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 90-431 Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection 90-414(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 90-431 Amendments. 
(a)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(b)  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(5)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to section 90-431 Amendments. 
(6)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(7)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022, applies. 
(8)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a)  This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
(9)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this article, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
(10)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This articledoes not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This article does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(11)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(12)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Columbia County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS 

Sec. 90-301. - General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. 
    The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. 
    Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this article and all other requirements in subsection 90-412(2). Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-302. - Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
(1)  No floodplain development shall: 
(a)  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or 
(b)  Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of section 90-431 Amendments> are met. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013)

i.  Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge, culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study. 
ii.  Channel sections must be surveyed. 
iii.  Minimum four foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping. 
iv.  A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 
v.  The most current version of HEC_RAS shall be used. 
vi.  A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure. 
vii.  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
viii.  Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
ix.  The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet.

i.  Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot. 
ii.  Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for Department review. 
iii.  Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 
iv.  Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
v.  All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
vi.  Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested.

Sec. 90-472. - Conditional use permit. 
(1)  Authority. The development and execution of this section is based upon the division of the city into zoning districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses, which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use at a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development, and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses. 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval or denial of proposed conditional uses. (Refer to the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 62.23.) Under this chapter, a proposed conditional use shall be denied unless the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the proposed conditional use will not create undesirable impacts on nearby properties, the environment, or the community as a whole. 
(3)  Limited conditional uses. Limited conditional uses are the same as regular conditional uses excepting that further, in considered findings of the plan commission and the granting thereof, because of any of the following should be of lesser permanence than regular conditional uses, and the duration or term of existence may be established until time certain or be limited to a future happening or event at which time the same shall terminate: 
(a)  Their particularly specialized nature. 
(b)  Their particular locations within a district. 
(c)  The peculiar unique relationships or needed compatibility of uses to involved individuals. 
(d)  Any other reason(s) the plan commission deems specially relevant and material to delimit the scope thereof. 
(4)  Initiation of conditional use permit. A request for a conditional use may be initiated by the owner(s) and/or operator of the subject property. Conditional use permit applications initiated by the operator of the subject property must include the property owner's signature 
(5)  Application. An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the city clerk and shall contain the following items, unless specifically waived by the zoning administrator. Digital files should be submitted whenever possible. 
(a)  Written description of the proposed conditional use including: 
1.  Type of activities. 
2.  Location and size of proposed buildings and/or structures. 
3.  Location and number of off-street parking spaces. 
(b)  Written justification for the proposed conditional use, including evidence that the application is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  A map at a scale not less than 1? = 800' depicting the current zoning of the subject property and all other lands within 300 feet, all lot dimensions of the subject property, and a graphic scale and north arrow. 
(d)  Names and addresses of land owners within 200 feet of the subject property as they appear on the current tax records. 
(e)  A site plan of the subject property if proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to all requirements of section 90-474. If the proposed conditional use is a group or large development (per section 90-64), a proposed preliminary plat or conceptual plat may be substituted for the required site plan, provided said plat contains all information required on said site plan. 
(6)  Staff Review. 
(a)  The zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate whether the proposed amendment: 
1.  Is in harmony with the recommendations of the comprehensive plan. 
2.  Will result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on nearby property, the character of the neighborhood, environment, traffic, parking, public improvements, public property, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may in the future. 
3.  Maintains the desired consistency of land uses and development related to the environs of the subject property. 
4.  The conditional use is located in an area that will be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services provided by public agencies serving the subject property. 
5.  The potential public benefits outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed conditional use, after taking into consideration the applicant's proposal and any requirements recommended by the applicant to ameliorate such impacts. 
(b)  The zoning administrator shall prepare a staff report addressing items 1 through 5, above, and forward said report to the plan commission for review and use in making its recommendation to the common council. If the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the comprehensive plan, he shall note this determination in the report. 
(7)  Public Hearing. The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed conditional use permit per the procedure of section 90-468. 
(8)  Plan commission review and action. 
(a)  The plan commission shall review the application and staff report and may authorize the zoning administrator to issue a conditional use permit for either regular or limited conditional use, provided that such conditional use and involved structure are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this chapter and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. 
(b)  In the instance of the granting of a limited conditional use, the plan commission in its findings shall further specify the delimiting reason or factors which resulted in issuing limited rather than regular conditional use. 
(c)  Such plan commission resolution and the resulting conditional use permit, when, for limited conditional use, shall specify the period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee, the location and legal description of the affected premises. 
(d)  Prior to the granting of a conditional use, the plan commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards herein prescribed are being complied with. 
(9)  Recordation. Except for conditional use approvals for temporary uses or limited conditional uses, a certified copy of the authorizing resolution, containing identifiable description and any specific requirements of approval, shall be recorded by the city with the County Register of Deeds. 
(10)  Effect of denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the zoning administrator. 
(11)  Violation and revocation. 
(a)  Any conditional use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this chapter shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties. 
(b)  A conditional use may be revoked for such a violation by a majority vote of the plan commission following the procedure outlined in subsections (3) to (5) above. 
(12)  Time limits on developments. 
(a)  The start of construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 day of their approval by the plan commission and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be defined as the granting of an occupancy permit for the conditional use. 
(b)  Prior to such a revocation, the applicant may request an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by the plan commission and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by the plan commission). 
(13)  Discontinuance. Any and all conditional uses which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this period. 
(14)  Change of ownership. All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property; however, submittal of a plan of operation shall be required prior to the change in ownership. For bed and breakfasts, the granting of a conditional use permit shall be valid while said property is owned by the owner at time of conditional use approval. 
(15)  Modification, alteration, or expansion. Modification, alteration, or expansion of any conditional use without approval by the plan commission, shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be grounds for revocation of said conditional use approval. 
(16)  Formerly approved conditional uses. A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, either permitted by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of this chapter, shall be considered as a legal, conforming land use so long as the previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall require application and city consideration under this section.

All portions of an approved planned development not fully developed within ten years of final common council approval shall expire, and no additional planned development based development shall be permitted. The common council may extend this ten-year period by up to five additional years via a majority vote following a public hearing. Submitting a request for extension does not guarantee it will be granted. 
(11)  Requirement to depict all aspects of development. Only development which is explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the common council as part of the approved planned development shall be permitted, even if such development (including all aspects of land use, density, intensity, bulk, landscaping, parking, and loading) is otherwise listed as permitted in this chapter. Requested exemptions from these standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application, and shall be recommended by the plan commission and approved explicitly by the common council. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted. 
(12)  Minor Changes to an Approved Planned Development. In the event that the applicant wishes to make a minor change to an approved planned development, depending on the type of request, it will go through one of the above described steps. This process is detailed as follows: 
(a)  If the proposed project requires additional zoning ordinance flexibility for use, density, bulk, or performance standards that have not already been granted, the request shall go through Step 3: General development plan. 
(b)  If the proposed project requires more permissive operations than would be allowed for a permitted-by-right or conditional land use, the request shall go through Step 4: Specific implementation plan. 
(c)  If the proposed project is merely an adjustment of the arrangement (e.g. within the approved use, density, bulk, and performance standards requirements), and within the approved operational limits, the request shall obtain site plan approval per section 90-473. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-476. - Zoning permit. 
(1)  No vacant land in the R4, R5, B1, B2, B3, B4, M1, M2 or M3 zoning district shall be occupied or used, and no building shall be hereafter erected, structurally altered, relocated, used or occupied until a zoning permit has been issued certifying that any such building, use or occupancy complies with the provisions of this chapter. For new construction, addition, relocation or structural alteration, a zoning permit issuance shall be preceded by plan commission approval (if required per section 90-474) of a site plan of the property and building. A like permit shall be obtained before any change is made in the type of use or before any legal nonconforming use is resumed, changed, extended or granted conditional use status. 
(2)  Application. 
(a)  Application for such permit shall be made to the zoning administrator prior to or at the same time as the application for a building permit or prior to the commencement of any use not involving a building permit. 
(b)  Such application shall state that the building or proposed use of a building or land complies with all the building and health laws and with the provisions of this chapter, a statement by the applicant as to the intended use of the premises and buildings thereon. 
(c)  Within ten days after the notification of the completion of the erection, alteration or relocation of the building or of intent to commence a use, the zoning administrator or his/her designee may make an inspection of the premises and any building thereof and of the building and the intended use thereof, and if the proposed use of the premises complies with the requirements of this chapter, a zoning permit shall be issued. 
(d)  For the purpose of defraying the cost of inspection and administrative processing, such application shall be accompanied by such fee as established by the common council. If a zoning permit application is submitted in conjunction with a building permit, than no separate, additional fee for the zoning permit shall be assessed. 
(3)  If, within 12 months of the date of application, no zoning permit has been issued, any building permit related thereto shall lapse and the zoning administrator shall make immediate investigation to ascertain that no use or occupancy has, in fact, commenced without proper authority. Upon showing valid cause, the zoning administrator may grant an extension of such permit for a period not to exceed six months. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013; Ord. No. 17-001, 1-26-2017) 
Sec. 90-477. - Sign permit. 
    Per the requirements of the sign ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-478. - Variance. 
(1)  Purpose. 
(a)  A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter would cause undue hardship or create conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to a nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning requirements. 
(b)  The board of zoning appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owning to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection that the flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, the term "unnecessary hardship" shall be defined as an unusual or extreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoning district which is caused by facts, such as rough terrain or good soil conditions, uniquely applicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most or all property in the same zoning district. 
(2)  Application. The application for variance shall be filed with the zoning administrator. Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected. The application is available at the city clerk's office. 
(3)  Public hearing. 
(a)  The application shall be referred to the board of zoning appeals. The petitioner shall appear before the plan commission in order to answer questions. 
(b)  The board of zoning appeals shall conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed variance. Notice of such hearing shall be given not more than 30 days and not less than ten days before the hearing in one or more of the newspapers in general circulation in the city, and shall give due notice to the parties in interest and the zoning administrator. At the hearing, the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. The board of zoning appeals shall thereafter reach its decision within 30 days after the final hearing and shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant, zoning administrator and Plan Commission. 
(4)  Action of the board of zoning appeals. For the board of zoning appeals to grant a variance, it must find that: 
(a)  Denial of variation may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographical consideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed. 
(b)  The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which variation is being sought and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity. 
(c)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the property. 
(d)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(e)  The proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of this chapter. 
(5)  Conditions. The board of zoning appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-479. - Interpretation. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this chapter, and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation. 
(2)  Initiation of request. Proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods: an application of the owner(s) of the subject property; a recommendation of the plan commission to the common council; by action of the common council; or by request of the zoning administrator. 
(3)  Application. A zoning interpretation application contains all of the following: 
(a)  Clear indication of the text of this chapter for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text. 
(b)  If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this Chapter to a specific property, the additional following information shall be required (digital files should be submitted rather than paper copies whenever possible): 
(c)  A map of the subject property at a scale of 1? = 800' depicting: 
1.  All lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 200 feet of the boundaries of the subject property. 
2.  Current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. 
3.  All lot dimensions of the subject property. 
4.  A graphic scale and a north arrow. 
(d)  Names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current records of the register of deeds of Columbia County. 
(e)  A written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities, buildings, and structures currently located on, and proposed for, the subject property. 
(f)  A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of section 90-474. 
(g)  If the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this Chapter, a series of written responses to the following questions: 
(h)  How is the subject land use (in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the city's comprehensive plan, this chapter, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city? 
(i)  How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought? 
(4)  Staff review. 
(a)  The zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed variance provided in the application to determine whether the requested variance is in harmony with the recommendations of city's comprehensive plan. If the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the comprehensive plan, the zoning administrator shall note this determination in the report. 
(5)  Standards for review. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the common council as noted in this chapter and the comprehensive plan. The intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed, modified, or existing land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows: 
(a)  Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation is required. (Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated.) 
(b)  Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. There is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use, and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the chapter. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited. 
(c)  Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land use proposal. If an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party (i.e. the adjoining landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter. Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter. Any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements. 
(6)  This chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals, and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options. Persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council. 
(7)  In addition to the applicant's response to the questions required by subsection (5), above, the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters: 
(a)  No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance, the official zoning map, or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation. 
(b)  No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right, a special use, or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property (see article II). 
(c)  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject property's zoning district (see article II). 
(d)  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district, or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category (see article II). 
(e)  If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject property's district than to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to section 90-472. 
(8)  Effect of a favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, required site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and certificates of occupancy. 
(9)  Limitations on favorable land use interpretation. 
(a)  No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit is issued and development has begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. 
(b)  An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-480. - Appeal of zoning interpretation. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and decide requests for appeals from the interpretations of the zoning administrator as provided for by Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(e)(7). 
(2)  Initiation of request for appeal. 
(a)  Appeals to the zoning board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the administrative officer. 
(b)  Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the alleged grievance or judgment in question by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of zoning appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, together with payment of a filing fee as may be established by the common council in the official city fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office. 
(c)  The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board of zoning appeals all papers constituting the record of appeals upon which the action appeals from was taken. 
(3)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator from whom the appeal is taken to the board of zoning appeals determines that, by reason of facts state in the certificate, a stay would cause immediate peril to life or property. In such case, the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on application and on notice to the zoning administrator and on due cause shown. 
(4)  Time limit for filing an appeal. Any appeal under the provisions of this section shall be made per the requirements of this section, below, within a period not exceeding 30 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation by the zoning administrator. Failure to initiate this appeal procedure within this 30 day period shall constitute a final and binding waiver of the right to appeal said interpretation. 
(5)  Public hearing. Within 45 days of filing of a complete application, the board of zoning appeals shall hold a public hearing in compliance with section 90-468 to consider the request. 
(6)  Review and action by the board of zoning appeals. 
(a)  The board of zoning appeals shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days after the public hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the board's decision to the appellant or applicant and the zoning administrator. 
(b)  Conditions may be placed upon any zoning permit ordered or authorized by the board of zoning appeals. 
(c)  Variances granted by the board of zoning appeals shall expire within 6 months unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant. 
(7)  Review by court of record. Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the zoning board of appeals may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the offices of the zoning board of appeals. 
(Ord. No. 13-005, § 1, 3-28-2013) 
Sec. 90-481. - Violations. 
(1)  Violation of this chapter. It shall be unlawful to use or improve any structure or land, or to use water or air in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. In case of any violation, the common council, zoning administrator, plan commission or any property owner who would be specifically damaged by such violation may cause appropriate action or proceeding to be instituted to enjoin a violation of this chapter or cause a structure to be vacated or removed. 
(2)  Remedial action. Whenever an order of the zoning administrator has not been complied with within 30 days after written notice has been mailed to the owner, the resident agent or occupant of the premises, the common council, the zoning administrator or the city attorney may institute appropriate legal action or proceedings. 
(3)  Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any order of the zoning administrator issued in accordance with this chapter or resists enforcement shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a forfeiture and such additional penalties as provided for in section 1-15 of the Municipal Code.
