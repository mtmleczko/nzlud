Preface
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances
of the City of Marshfield, Wisconsin.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as
supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source
of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was
adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the
comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any
section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance
included herein.
The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate
usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to
relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and
setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system
used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of
two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter
number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within
the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-02, and the first
section of chapter 6 is 6-01. Under this system, each section is identified with its
chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place
by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material
consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-01 and
6-02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-01.5. New
articles may be included in the same way or may be placed at the end of the
chapter embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to
the new article.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to
the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the
volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page
in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the
colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the
Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the
appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or
may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1
CODE INDEX CDi:1
Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has
been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally
used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross
references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to
the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will
be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited,
and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be
distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the
holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the
responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the
attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such
amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them
and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference
purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Senior
Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation,
Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the
publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the
project.

CONSTRUCTION AND EFFECT OF ORDINANCE
CD1:2
Sec. 1-01. Title; effective date; citation.
These ordinances shall be known as the City of Marshfield Municipal Code and shall take effect from and after
passage and publication as provided in § 66.0103 Wis. Stats. All references thereto shall be cited by section number
(example: section 13-06, City of Marshfield Municipal Code).
(Code 1982, § 25.07)
Sec. 1-02. Rules of construction.
In the construction of this Municipal Code, the following rules shall be observed unless such construction
would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the ordinance:
Acts of agents. When a provision requires an act to be done which may by law as well be done by an agent as by
the principal, such requirement shall be construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
Gender, singular and plural. Every word in this Code and in any ordinance imparting the masculine gender
may extend and be applied to females as well as males, and every word imparting the singular number only may
extend and be applied to several persons or things as well as to one person or thing; provided these rules of
construction shall not be applied to any provision which contains any express language excluding such construction
or when the subject matter or context of such provision may be repugnant thereto.
Person. The term "person" extends and applies to natural persons, firms, corporations, associations, partnerships
or other bodies politic and to all entities capable of being sued, unless plainly inapplicable.
Wisconsin Statutes. All references to "Wisconsin Statutes" or "Wis. Stats." shall mean the
Wisconsin Statutes, as amended.
(Code 1982, § 25.01)
Sec. 1-03. Conflict and separability.
(1) Conflict of provisions. If the provisions of the different chapters of this Code conflict with or contravene
each other, the provisions of each chapter shall prevail as to all matters and questions arising out of the
subject matter of such chapter.
(2) Separability of Code provisions. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of the Code is for any
reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by reason of any decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of any other section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase or portion thereof. The council hereby declares that it would have passed this Code and each section,
subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases or portions may be declared invalid or unconstitutional.
(Code 1982, § 25.02)
Sec. 1-04. Clerk to file documents incorporated by reference.
Whenever in this Code any standard, code, rule, regulation or other written or printed matter is adopted by
reference, it shall be deemed incorporated in this Code as if fully set forth in this Code, and the clerk shall file,
deposit and keep in his office a copy of the code, standard, rule, regulation or other written or printed matter as
adopted. Materials so filed, deposited and kept shall be public records open for examination with proper care by any

person during the clerk's office hours, subject to such orders or regulations which the clerk may prescribe for their
preservation.
(Code 1982, § 25.03)
Sec. 1-05. Penalty provisions.

Code shall, upon conviction of such violation, be subject to a penalty, which shall be as follows:
(a) First offense. Any person who shall violate any provision of this Code shall, upon conviction thereof,
forfeit not less than $5.00 nor more than $500.00, together with the costs of prosecution, and in default
of payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such
forfeiture and costs are paid, but not exceeding 90 days.
(b) Second offense. Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this Code or part of a provision
of this Code who has previously been convicted of a violation of the same provision within one year
shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $10.00 nor more than $750.00 for each such
offense, together with the costs of prosecution, and in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs
shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such forfeiture and costs are paid, but not exceeding six
months.
(2) Continued violations. Each violation and each day a violation continues or occurs shall constitute a separate
offense unless specifically provided to the contrary. Nothing in this Code shall preclude the city from
maintaining any appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of any provision of this Code.
(3) Execution against defendant's property. Whenever any person fails to pay any forfeiture and costs of
prosecution upon the order of any court for violation of any ordinance of the city, the court may, in lieu of
ordering imprisonment of the defendant, or after the defendant has been released from custody, issue an
execution against the property of the defendant for such forfeiture and costs.
(4) Additional remedies. The imposition of a penalty as provided in this section shall not be deemed, nor shall
it constitute any waiver on the part of the city, of its right to prosecute any claim for damage which might
be or might have been caused to any public property by any person violating this Code.
(Code 1982, § 25.04)
Sec. 1-06. Repeal of general ordinances.

amendment takes effect.
(b) Affect any vested right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any
enactment so repealed or amended, unless the privilege of repealing such obligation or privilege has
been reserved by the city.
(c) Affect any offense committed, or penalty or forfeiture incurred, previous to the time when any

provisions of any ordinance, such provisions shall apply to and control any judgment to be pronounced
after such ordinance takes effect for any offense committed before that time.
(d) Affect any prosecution for any offense, or the levy of any penalty or forfeiture pending at the time
when any ordinance aforesaid is repealed or amended; but the right of action shall continue and the
offender shall be subject to the penalty as provided in such ordinance, and such prosecution shall
proceed, in all respects, as if such ordinance had not been repealed; except all such proceedings had
after the time this Code takes effect shall be conducted according to the provisions of this Code.

date of the return until the first day of the month following the month in which the tax is paid or deposited
with the finance director. All refunded taxes shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the
due date of the return until the first day of the month in which the taxes are refunded. An extension of time
within which to file a return shall not operate to extend the due date of the return for purposes of interest
computation. If the finance director determines that any overpayment of tax has been made intentionally or
by reason of carelessness or neglect, or if the tax which was overpaid was not accompanied by a complete
return, he shall not allow any interest thereon.

be added to the tax required to be paid, exclusive of interest and other penalties.

revenue of the city. If any such person fails or refuses to place such security, the city clerk may revoke his
permit. If any taxpayer is thereafter delinquent in the payment of the taxes imposed by this section, the

security placed with the city clerk by such taxpayer. No interest shall be paid by the city to any person for

(1) No person whose operating privilege has been duly revoked or suspended pursuant to the laws of this state
shall operate a motor vehicle upon any highway in this state during such suspension or revocation or
thereafter before filing proof of financial responsibility or before that person has obtained a new license in

or a forfeiture.
(3) Refusal to accept or failure to receive an order of revocation or suspension mailed by first class mail to
such person' last known address shall not be a defense to the charge of driving after revocation or
suspension. If the person has changed his or her address and fails to notify the department as required in §

to a motor vehicle which he or she is the owner, the court may order the vehicle impounded. The court may
determine the manner and period of impoundment. The cost of keeping the vehicle constitutes a lien.
(5) If a motor vehicle impounded under subsection (4) of this section is subject to a security agreement or lease
contract, the vehicle shall be released by the court to the lessor or secured creditor upon the filing of an
affidavit by the lessor or secured creditor that the security agreement or lease contract is in default and shall

MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD9:23

premises arising from a single or a closely related incident shall not be charged as multiple
violations. It is intended by this subsection that violations by two or more persons in the same
party or group, or two or more violations at the same time and place by one individual shall be
considered a single incident, but multiple violations by unconnected individuals at the same time
and place may be considered as separate violations.
6. Uncorroborated testimony by a minor accused of a violation of the provisions of section 9-45 of

LICENSES AND PERMITS
CD9:24
(3) Automatic revocation. A license accruing 100 demerit points or more during two license periods shall be
subject to revocation as a matter of course, absent compelling mitigating factors. If the council shall
determine that such factors exist, it shall refer the matter to the committee for recommendation regarding a
probationary period of continuation for the license holder. The committee, after consultation with the police
department, city attorney and such other persons the committee deems appropriate, may recommend
probationary provisions to the council, which shall be deemed sufficient to ensure future compliance with
state statutes and this article. Pending such recommendation and further action by the council, the license
shall be suspended, unless the council shall determine such suspension would result in extreme and undue
hardship.
(4) Effect of charge dismissed. A dismissal of a criminal charge or civil forfeiture case on a violation which is
also the subject of demerit points shall not, as a matter of law, nullify such charge for the purpose of review
herein due to the differing burdens of proof and procedural requirements.
(5) Delay in license issuance. Any person or party who performs a licensed activity without first having
obtained a proper license, or who, during a period of license suspension, or who, after license revocation or
nonrenewal, unlawfully engages in a licensed activity, shall be barred from applying for the required
license for a period of six months from the date of such offense.
(6) New licenses granted subject to demerit points. New licenses may be granted subject to such number of
demerit points or other conditions as the council, in its discretion, may deem appropriate, irrespective of the
nature of the offense, where the council has concern as to the arrest and conviction record, moral character
and business responsibility of the applicant, which is insufficient for license denial.
(7) Time for action. Disciplinary action need not be commenced and completed in the same license year as the
offense occurred. Where disciplinary actions are not commenced and completed within a license term, a
license shall be granted subject to a "nonrenewal revocation hearing," to be held as soon as is practical.
(a) For offenses committed within the City of Marshfield under this Chapter, disciplinary action shall be
commenced within 60 days of an offense which gives rise to the disciplinary action. If no action is
taken within 60 days of the offense giving cause for the disciplinary action, no complaint based solely
on that offense may be the basis for disciplinary action.
(8) Disciplinary hearings. Disciplinary hearings, including nonrenewal, suspension and revocation hearings,
shall be held before the committee, which shall submit a report to the council, including findings of fact,
and a recommendation as to what action, if any, the council should take with respect to the license. The
committee shall provide the complainant and the licensee with a copy of the report. Either the complainant
or licensee may make an objection, orally or in writing, to the report and shall have the opportunity to
present arguments supporting the objection to the council. The council shall determine whether the
arguments shall be presented orally or in writing, or both. If the council, after considering the committee's
report and any arguments presented by the complainant and licensee, finds the complaint to be true, or if
there is not objection to a report recommending a suspension, revocation or nonrenewal, the license shall be
suspended, revoked or not renewed as provided by law. If the council finds the complaint untrue, the
proceedings shall be dismissed without cost to the accused. The city clerk shall give notice of each
suspension, revocation or nonrenewal to the party whose license is affected.
(9) Judgment of conviction, as prima facie proof of violation. The judgment of conviction of any licensee, or
employee or agent thereof, in any municipal, state or federal court, irrespective of whether obtained
following a plea agreement, or bond forfeiture, shall be prima facie proof of such violation for purposes of
this article. However, in the instance of any judgment of conviction entered pursuant to a no contest plea, or
considered in law to be rendered pursuant to a no contest plea, such judgment of conviction as a prima facie
case may be rebutted. Further, mitigating circumstances may be introduced with respect to any judgment of
conviction.
(10)Application for determination of demerit points. Any licensee or party entitled to initiate a request for an
investigation under subsection (1) of this section may at any time request the committee or the council to
MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD9:25
determine whether or not conduct which has occurred constitutes a basis for demerit points and a report of
outstanding demerit points. Any licensee may appeal imposition of demerit points by written application
for hearing to the committee. Hearings concerning such appeals shall be conducted as provided at § 125.12
Wis. Stats. and this article.
(11)Violations by agents or employees. A violation of this article by an authorized agent or employee of a
licensee acting in the course of his or her employment shall constitute a violation by the licensee. The
licensee shall be notified of such violation by copy of the citation, or other written notice personally served
or mailed to the licensee at the licensed premises.
(12)Commencement of penalties. Penalties shall commence the day after they have been imposed by the
council. Days of suspension shall run consecutively.
(13)Periodic reports by police chief. The police chief shall file periodic reports with the city clerk of conduct by
any licensee, or employees thereof, which may constitute a basis for demerit points. The city clerk shall
provide each licensee with a summary of demerit points affecting the license annually at the time an
application for renewal is received, or upon request. The committee, at license renewal time, or at any
earlier time deemed appropriate may bring such matters to the attention of the city attorney and make a
request for a recommendation on disciplinary action.
(14)Exceptions. This section shall apply to operator's licenses, except accrual of 50 or more demerit points shall
constitute grounds for revocation of an operator's permit.

persons who have been denied operator's licenses by the council or who have had their operator's
licenses revoked or suspended within the preceding 12 months. The city shall provide an appropriate
application form to be completed in full by the applicant. The city clerk may revoke a provisional
license issued if he discovers that the holder of the license made a false statement on the application.
Following completion of the responsible beverage server training course and notification from the
school, the license application will be presented to the committee, for referral to the council. If
approved by the council, the regular operator's license shall be issued as provided above.

(a) After the council approves the granting of an operator's license, the city clerk shall issue the license.
Such licenses shall be issued and numbered in the order they are granted and shall give the applicant's

considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses which are substantially related to the
licensed activity within the bar immediately preceding the license application or activities or violations
which would result in 50 demerit points under the provisions of section 9-34(3). Because a license is a

applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. Based upon such
investigation, the chief of police or his designee shall provide a written recommendation for approval or

Article II. Administration
Sec. 19-31. Variances.
(1) For property within the City Limits where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may recommend variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
this chapter; and further provided that the plan commission shall not recommend variations or exceptions to
the regulations of this chapter unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that all three of the following criteria are met:
(e) Unnecessary Hardship. That an unnecessary hardship exists if the property owner shows that they
have no reasonable use of the property without a use variance or when compliance would unreasonably
prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with
such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome without an area variance;
(f) Unique Property Limitations. That the need for a variance is due to unique physical limitations of the
property, such as steep slopes or wetlands, that prevent compliance with the ordinance; and
(g) No Harm to Public Interests. That granting of the variance will not result in harm to the public
interests and will not materially impair the general purposes of this chapter as well as the general
purpose of a specific zoning provision.
(2) When in the judgment of the Plan Commission, or City Engineer for minor subdivision, it would be
inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter because the subdivision is located outside the
corporate limits within the extraterritorial plat review area, it may waive such provision or vary it in the
manner that would best serve the public interest.

with appropriate City Staff that may include the Planning and Economic Development Department,
Department of Public Works, Engineering Division, Building Services Division, Marshfield Utilities,
the Marshfield Fire Department, and such other departments as determined by the Planning and
Economic Development Department.
(b) To request a Concept Plan Conference, the developer shall submit an application and Concept Plan for
the proposed subdivision five (5) days prior to the requested meeting date.
(2) Preliminary plat or map procedure. Before submitting a final plat or map for approval, the subdivider shall
prepare a preliminary plat or map. The preliminary plat or map shall be prepared in accordance with this
chapter and one (1) large 22" x 30" or larger copy along with an electronic copy in PDF format shall be
submitted to the Planning and Economic Development Department least twenty-five (25) days prior to the
meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired.
(a) Upon submittal of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall be responsible for forwarding the original
plat to the director in accordance with § 236.12(6)Wis. Stats.
(b) Public hearing & notification. Before taking action on a preliminary plat, the Plan Commission shall
hold a public hearing following the guidelines of at least a Class I notice. Notice of the proposed plat
and of the scheduled hearing shall be sent by regular mail at least ten (10) days before the date of such
hearing to the owners of record of all properties located within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of
the proposed plat.
(c) When the City determines to approve a plat within the City, it shall give at least 10 days' prior written
notice of its intention to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any
portion of such proposed plat but failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any such plat.

materials submitted, for conformity with all ordinances, administrative rules and regulations. The plan
commission may negotiate with the subdivider regarding changes deemed advisable, and the kind and
extent of changes which will be required. Failure of the Plan Commission to act within the 90 days, or
extension thereof, constitutes an approval of the preliminary plat.
(f) The action of the Plan Commission shall be noted on two (2) copies of the preliminary plat or map;
one copy will be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon, and if approved
conditionally or rejected, the conditions or reasons therefore in writing. The second copy shall be filed

original plat to the director in accordance with § 236.12(6)Wis. Stats. The Council shall not act on a
plat after referral by the Plan Commission until the plat has been approved by the director. The Council
shall approve or reject the plat within sixty (60) days of submission of the plat, unless the time is
extended by agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in the minutes of the
Council meeting and a copy forwarded to the subdivider. The final plat may, if permitted by the Plan
Commission, constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider
proposes to record at the time of submittal, except that a final plat that is only a portion of an approved
preliminary plat may be submitted without the permission of the approving authority and is entitled to
approval if the preliminary plat identifies phases of the development and the portion of the final plat
being submitted substantially conforms to the preliminary plat or portion of the preliminary plat as
approved. If the City fails to act within sixty (60) days and the time has not been extended by
agreement and if no unsatisfied objections have been filed within that period, that plat shall be deemed
approved.
(d) Two (2) 22" x 30" true copies and a digital copy of the approved final plat or map in MicroStation
format or equal in Wisconsin's Wood County Coordinate System shall be filed with the City Clerk.

(a) Sanitary sewer. Sanitary sewers shall be constructed in the locations needed to provide service to each
lot. Laterals shall be installed for each lot terminating not less than seven (7) feet inside the property
from the street right-of-way line. Where platted utility easements exist, additional consideration shall
be made to extend laterals beyond the platted easements. If a sewage lift station is necessary to serve
the subdivision, subdividers shall share in cost of the lift station and associated force main in the same
ratio that the area of the subdivision bears to the total area served by the lift station. The plans for
sanitary sewers shall be approved by the City Engineer and the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources. Construction shall be under the supervision of the Engineering Division or an engineering
consultant agreed upon by the subdivider and the City Engineer and the cost of such supervision shall
be borne by the subdivider. If the City is required to construct sanitary facilities outside of the
boundaries of the subdivision to serve the subdivision facilities, the subdivider shall be responsible for
any cost of such construction not recovered by the City through special assessments unless other
arrangements are made through a developer's agreement.
(b) Water. Water mains shall be installed within the subdivision boundaries to provide service to each lot
in conformance with the regulations of the Marshfield Utility Commission. Laterals shall be installed
for each lot terminating not less than seven (7) feet inside the property from the street right-of-way
line.
(c) Storm sewer. Such facilities shall include mains, ditches, channels, inlets, catch basins and laterals as
required by the City Engineer and the Board of Public Works. All storm sewer systems shall be
required to handle a ten (10) year design storm unless there is a history of flooding or property
damage. Subdivisions shall be designed to safely convey up to the 100 year storm without property
damage. All subdividers shall be held to the current WDNR stormwater management standards NR151
and NR216 as well as the chs. 25 and 26 of this code.
(d) Streets. The street construction shall include all grading, base course, stormwater drainage systems,
curb and gutter and concrete or asphalt pavement, in accordance with the current construction
standards on file with the City Engineer. If permitted by City Engineer and the Board of Public Works,
a street may be constructed without curb and gutter.
(e) Sidewalks. The street construction shall include the installation of sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be
installed on both sides of the street. Sidewalks shall be installed as the improvements are being
constructed before a certificate of occupancy will be issued. Exceptions to this requirement shall only
be approved through a development agreement as identified in Sec. 19-63 (8). Standards for the
installation of sidewalk are on file with the City Engineer.
(f) Signage. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs associated with the purchasing and
installation of all street name signs and required traffic control signs. Where the development is a high
volume commercial development or a public facility such as a school or church the City Engineer shall
recommend to the Board of Public Works whether a traffic study shall be required for said
developments at the cost of the developer. The subdivider shall also be responsible the costs of the
initial installation of all pavement markings.
(g) Pedestrian and Bicycle Trails. The subdivider shall grant an easement to the City where new
subdivisions converge with opportune areas for new pedestrian and bicycle trails, according to the
Marshfield Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan.

(2) Responsibility for street and utility improvements. The subdivider shall be responsible for all costs of
required improvements, as follows, including construction plus engineering and city administrative costs of
sanitary sewer, water, storm sewer, sidewalks, and streets plus any other costs of construction not recovered
by the City through special assessment except as set forth below:
(a) Where the streets, storm, and sanitary sewer improvements are constructed on the exterior boundary of
a subdivision, the subdivision shall pay fifty (50) percent of storm and sanitary sewer mains and street
costs and the City shall pay fifty (50) percent, subject to budgeted funding, and subject to its right to
recover such costs upon improvement of the adjoining property.
(3) Plans and specifications. At the option of the City the plans and specifications for any or all of the required
improvements may be prepared by the City. If the subdivider is required by the City to furnish plans and
specifications, they shall be prepared by a registered engineer and approved by the City Engineer and any
state agency having jurisdiction over such plans. In either case, the subdivider shall be responsible for the
cost of plan preparation and any surveys needed to prepare the plans.
(4) Construction. The City may undertake construction with City forces at the request of the subdivider of
improvements normally constructed by the City if the City's construction schedule permits. Such
construction shall be approved by the Board of Public Works and the subdivider shall deposit a bond or
cash with the City in the amount of the estimated cost of the work prior to the start of construction.
Payment in full shall be made to the City upon the completion of the work. The construction of any
improvements not undertaken by the City shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.
(5) Inspection. All construction shall be subject to inspection by the Department of Public Works. The cost of
inspection shall be charged to the subdivider. For sanitary sewer construction, final inspection required
shall include air pressure testing, mandrel testing, and televising. In the event City personnel are unable to
complete inspection services, an outside consultant or third party services may be necessary. Such
consultant services and all costs associated with these services shall be born by the subdivider. The
consultant utilized for such services shall be approved by the City Engineer and subdivider.
(6) Dedication required. All facilities and improvements installed prior to the final approval of the plat shall be
considered dedicated to the City (pending inspection and acceptance of said improvements), along with
streets and other public areas, upon approval of the plat. Facilities and improvements completed under bond
or other financial guarantee, after approval of the plat, shall be considered dedicated (pending inspection
and acceptance of said improvements) to the City upon their approval and acceptance and release of the
bond or other guarantee.
(7) Development Agreement. All subdivisions that require public improvements shall require a development
agreement before final plat approval. The agreement shall provide, among other things, the following:
(a) The number and location of the lots to be developed during any period of time involved, which order
of development shall be termed "stages" or "phases."
(b) A description of the periods of time within which all of such stages or phases shall be developed.
(c) The method of financing such improvements by one or more of the following:
(1) Special assessments under § 66.0703 Wis. Stats. and the number of annual installments for each
phase, if determinable.
(2) Private financing to be obtained by the subdivider.
(3) Public financing as may be determined by the council, with the method of repayment to the city by
the subdivider, either by way of special assessments or otherwise, and the terms of such

(Street, Sidewalk, Storm Sewer, Sanitary Sewer, Watermain and Signage) are on record with the City
Engineer.
(f) A provision that the agreement and the terms thereof shall be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds for Wood or Marathon County, whichever is applicable, in order to give notice to any
subsequent purchasers of the property included in the subdivision or any phase thereof.
(g) A provision requiring a surety in favor of the City and in a form acceptable to the City Attorney to
secure performance of the development agreement. Said surety shall be in an amount equal to the
estimated cost of construction or other amount established by Common Council. If the subdivider's
project will be constructed in phases, the amount of any surety bond or other security required by the
City shall be limited to the phase of the project that is currently being constructed. The City may not
require that the subdivider provide any security for improvements sooner than is reasonably necessary
before the commencement of the installation of the improvements.
(h) A provision determining the time within which the installation of the required facilities shall
commence and be completed, so far as possible to ascertain.
(i) A provision, if requested by the developer and approved of by the City, that allows for an exception to
the sidewalk requirement in Sec. 19-63 (1) (e).
(j) Any other or additional provisions which may be deemed necessary by the City, or its appropriate
officials, in order to supplement the agreement and accomplish the end desired thereby, giving due
consideration to the needs of the subdivider and to the protection of the public.
(8) Exceptions. This section shall not apply to a situation involving a single lot of not more than 30,000 square
feet in area which is the subject of a certified survey map or plat if one side of the lot has access to an
existing, improved street and one side abuts on an unopened or undedicated street which is on the master
street plan as of the date of the application for a building permit, and if such lot does not exceed in length
along the unopened or undedicated street approximately the same length as any lot abutting on the other
side of such lot, or along the same street in the same block. As a condition of obtaining this exception,
however, the applicant for the building permit shall agree to provide, in the case of sale of such lot, a
covenant in the instrument of conveyance that the purchaser, or his successors in title, shall pay the costs of
installing the facilities otherwise required by this section, if such street is opened, and if requested to do so
by the Council, to the extent of 50 percent (50%) of such costs. In the event such street has not been
dedicated, a further condition shall be the dedication of a minimum of thirty (30) feet (or one-half of the
width of the street) as classified by the most current "City of Marshfield Comprehensive Plan", along the
entire length of the lot in question.

Article V. Park & Recreational Land Dedications
Sec. 19-80. Dedication of land for parks and recerational areas
(1) Purpose. This section is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of parks, playgrounds, trails,
recreation and open spaces as a function of subdivision and development in the City of Marshfield.
(2) Review. Upon the submission of a preliminary plat for a major subdivision, the zoning administrator shall
determine the dedication requirements and review them based on recommendations in the City's
Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan and request that this item be placed on
the Parks and Recreational Forestry Committee's subsequent meeting agenda. The Parks and Recreational
Forestry Committee shall review all park, playground, trail, recreation and open space dedications and
provide a recommendation to the Common Council based on the dedication requirements in Sec. 19-81.
(3) Dedication Requirement. In order that adequate open spaces and sites for public uses may be properly
located and reserved and in order that the cost of providing public areas, such as but not limited to, parks,
playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces may be equitably apportioned on the basis of additional
need created by residential development, each subdivider of a major subdivision for residential use shall be
required to dedicate land or fees in lieu of land for parks, recreation or open spaces.
(4) General Design. In the design of a major subdivision or planned unit development, provision shall be made
for suitable sites of adequate area for parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces. Such sites are
to be shown on the Preliminary Plat and Final Plat, and the following areas should be preserved when
feasible but shall not count towards the required parkland dedication: scenic and historic sites, stands of
trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie and
wetlands, and plant and animal communities.
(5) Site Reservations Required. Where the area proposed to be divided contains a park, playground, trail, or
other public area which is shown in the Comprehensive Plan or the Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation
Plan, such area shall either be dedicated to the proper public agency, or, at the Common Council's
determination, it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby within a three (3) year period by purchase or
other means if such lands meet or exceed dedication requirements. If the land is not acquired during this
period, it shall be released to the subdivider.
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 12-14-2010)
Sec. 19-81. Dedication requirements
(1) Dedication of Sites. When feasible and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive
Outdoor Recreation Plan, the subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide
for park, playground, trail, recreation and open space needs of the land development within the City of
Marshfield. The location of such land to be dedicated shall be determined by the Common Council. Where
the dedication is not compatible with the Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation
Plan, or for other reasons is not feasible as determined by the Common Council, the subdivider shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the City a fee as established by this Article, or a combination thereof.
(2) Dedication of Parks, Playgrounds, Trails, Recreation and Open Spaces. The subdivider shall dedicate
sufficient land area to provide adequate parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces to meet the
needs to be created by and to be provided for the land division, subdivision or comprehensive development.
The minimum dedication shall be one (1) acre for each forty-five (45) potential dwelling units or fractions
thereof.
MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD19:25
(3) Combination of Residential Uses. Where a combination of residential uses is intended, the minimum
dedication shall be the sum obtained by adding the potential residential units intended for single-family and
two-family dwellings, and the potential residential units intended for multifamily dwellings. Where a
definite commitment is made to the City by the developer with respect to those portions of the project
intended for single family, duplex and multi-family dwellings, the dedication shall be based upon the
maximum dedications which the zoning classification of the parcel will permit.
(4) Minimum Size of Park and Recreation Land Dedications.
a. In general, land reserved for parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces purposes shall have an
area of at least one (1) acre of contiguous land. Where the amount of land to be dedicated is less than
one (1) acre, the Common Council may require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on
the edge of the proposed major subdivision or planned unit development so that additional land may be
added at such time that the adjacent land is subdivided.
b. Land dedicated for the purpose of establishing trails shall be shown as an easement on the Preliminary
and Final Plats. The minimum width of the easement shall be no less than thirty (30) feet wide. Widths
greater than 30 feet may be required in certain circumstances as determined by the Plan Commission.
Neither end of the easement may result in a dead-end, unless a future connection has been identified or
may be reasonably established. Up to onehundred percent (100%) of the total land area of the granted
easement may be counted towards the overall dedication requirement.

(5) Fees in Lieu of Land.
a. Where, the Common Council, determines there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed land
division or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the City's Comprehensive Plan or
Outdoor Recreation Plan, the minimum size under Section 19-81 (4) cannot be met, or City officials
determine that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the Common Council, shall
require the subdivider to contribute a park and recreation development fee in lieu of land. The fees
collected shall be held in a non-lapsing fund to be used for purchase, development, and improvement
of parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces. The total fee shall be computed on the basis
of the maximum residential use of each parcel permitted in the particular zoning district under the
Zoning Code. For each proposed residential development, the fee shall be $200.00 for each residential
unit. The fee shall be paid to the City at the time of final plat approval.
b. The Common Council may, permit the subdivider to satisfy the requirements of this Article by
combining a land dedication with a fee payment. If only a percent of the land dedication is made, the
subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to the required per unit fee in lieu of land. For
example, if a land dedication of twenty-five percent (25%) of the required dedication is made, the
subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to seventyfive percent (75%) of the required per unit
fee in lieu of land.
c. The City shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this Section in a separate account to
be used at the discretion of the Common Council in any City-owned park, for developing adequate
parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces.
(6) Limitations. A subdivider shall not be required to dedicate more than one-fifth (1/5) of the total area of the
plat to meet the objectives of this Section.

access.
(9) Utility Extensions. The subdivider shall install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines
to the property line of all dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to the adjacent properties.

Sec. 19-82. When additional land is to be reserved
(1) When public parks and sites for other public areas as shown on the Comprehensive Plan lie within the
proposed area for development and are greater in area than required by Section 19-81 (4), the owner shall
reserve for acquisition by the City, through agreement, purchase or condemnation, the remaining greater
public area for a period of three (3) years of Final Plat approval unless extended by mutual agreement.
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 12-14-2010)

(1) When parklands are dedicated to the City, the subdivider is required to:
a. Properly grade and contour for proper drainage;
b. Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as approved by the City Engineer; and
c. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one (1) year following issuance of the first building permit

shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to maintain the area until the City accepts the dedication.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain the dedicated areas upon their dedication and
acceptance by the City.
(3) The Common Council may require certification of compliance with this Article by the subdivider. The cost
of such report shall be paid by the subdivider.
(4) If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this Section, the Common Council may contract said
completion and bill such costs to the subdivider, following a written notice to the subdivider of
noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate withholding of all building permits
until such costs are paid.

Article IV. Special Assessments
Sec. 13-96. Special assessments.
(1) When applicable. Benefitted properties shall be subject to special assessments, levied and collected in
accordance with § 66.0701 Wis. Stats. for the following public works or improvements:
(a) The opening of a street to traffic.
(b) The improvement of a street opened to traffic.
(c) The construction of a sanitary sewer main.
(d) The construction of a sanitary sewer lateral, storm sewer lateral or water service lateral.
(e) The construction, replacement or repair of a public sidewalk when done in connection with a street
improvement project.
(f) The construction and installation of a water main if necessary to be done in connection with a street
improvement project when, in the judgment of the council, it would be impractical for such water main
to be installed under the rules of the Marshfield Utility Commission. If required, a deposit for the cost
of the installation of such main shall be made from the general funds of the city.
(g) The construction of a storm sewer.
(2) Determining assessment rates for street construction. The following methods shall be used to determine
assessment rates for the opening of a street and improvements of a street:
(a) The front foot assessment rate shall be 33.33 percent of the total cost of construction for a single linear
foot of the typical cross section of roadway plus ten percent for engineering and administrative
overhead When federal, state or county funding is provided for the project to the extent of not more
than 66.67 percent thereof, then the frontfoot assessment rate shall be discounted by the percentage of
federal, state or county funding applied to the cost of the project. When federal, state or county
funding is provided for the project to the extent of at least 66.67 percent thereof, then the front foot
assessment rate shall be 50 percent of the resulting city share of the cost per lineal foot and shall be
discounted by the percentage of federal, state or country funding applied to the cost of the project.
(b) Where the project involves a cul-de-sac or different types of construction on the same project, the
procedure in subsection (2)(a) of this section may be modified to more accurately determine the
benefits accruing to each parcel of abutting property. In such case the total assessments levied shall not
exceed 66.67 percent of the total cost of construction as determined in subsection (2)(a) of this section.
(c) For property used for residential, educational, governmental or nonprofit corporation purposes,
regardless of the zoning classifications therefor, the side-foot rate shall be 50 percent of the front-foot
rate.
(d) For property used for any purpose other than those set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section, the
side-foot rate shall be 75 percent of the front-foot rate.
(e) For platted residential property where reversed frontage exists with the long side of the property
fronting on the project, and where there is no possibility of further construction, the assessment at the
MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD13:11
front-foot rate shall not exceed the length of the short side of the property and the balance shall be
assessed at the side-foot rate.
(f) When a parcel of residential property abutting the project has a lot line forming an interior angle of 65
degrees or less with the street right-of-way line then the equivalent frontage or sideage for assessment
purposes shall be determined by dividing the area of the parcel by the greatest distance that can be
measured from the street right-ofway line at right angles to such line. This shall not apply to a parcel of
land whose lot lines are parallel or do not diverge more than 15 degrees from being parallel, nor shall it
apply to sanitary sewer or sidewalk assessments.
(g) In the improvement of a street opened to traffic, it is determined that the maximum pavement
construction that is necessary to serve abutting property zoned for residential use isasphalt pavement
with curbs, 32 feet wide and 3- inches thick (two layers). Where pavement construction exceeds the
above dimensions the total cost of construction specified in subsection (2)(a) of this section shall be
based on a pavement of the dimensions stated in this subsection using prorated unit costs of actual
pavement construction or equivalent.
(3) Determining assessment rates for sanitary sewer main construction. The following methods shall be used
to determine assessment rates for sanitary sewer main construction:
(a) The total cost of construction plus ten percent for engineering and administrative overhead shall be
divided by the linear feet of all benefited properties, including property outside the corporate limits,
city-owned greenways and the side of a corner parcel where sewer has been previously installed and
special assessments charged on the opposite side of such corner parcel.
(b) The rate so determined shall be applied to each linear foot of all benefited property except property
referred to in subsection (3)(a) of this section as "included," and those assessments shall be paid by the
city.
(c) The word "side" as used in subsection (3)(a) of this section shall mean either the front, side or rear of a
parcel, whichever is applicable.
(d) Where the project involves construction in a cul-de-sac or in an easement, the procedures in subsection
(3)(a)—(3)(c) of this section may be modified to more accurately determine the assessments to be
levied against abutting properties benefited by the construction.
(4) Sanitary sewer lateral, storm sewer lateral, and water service lateral construction. The assessment for the
construction of a sanitary sewer service lateral, storm sewer laterals, or water service lateral shall be 100
percent of the total cost of construction plus ten percent for engineering and administrative overhead. The
cost of construction shall include all permit fees, connection charges and lift station fees where applicable.
(5) Sidewalk construction. The assessment for the construction, replacement or repair of a public sidewalk
when done in connection with a street improvement project shall be 100 percent of the total cost of
construction plus ten percent for engineering and administrative overhead except as follows:
If an existing sidewalk does not require repairs as required in the Sidewalk Construction and Repair Policy
and is removed and replaced as part of a street improvement project, due to adjustment for grade or cross
slope or due to nonconformance with the current standard for the Americans with Disabilities Act, said
sidewalk shall not be subject to special assessments.
(6) Determination of assessment rates for water main construction. The provisions of subsection (3) of this
section shall apply to the assessment for the construction and installation of a water main when done
pursuant to subsection (1)(f) of this section and section 19-63(2) of this Code.
PUBLIC WORKS
CD13:12
(7) Determination of assessment rates for storm sewer main construction. The following methods shall be
used to determine assessment rates for storm sewer construction:
(a) Storm sewer construction on streets without curb and gutter shall be subject to special assessments.
All properties served or benefitted by the new storm sewer system or appurtenances shall be
considered as part of the assessment district. Assessments shall be levied for 50 percent of the total
cost of construction.
(b)
(c) The assessment rate shall be determined pursuant to subsection (3) above of this section. The
assessment rate for properties used for agricultural, residential, educational, governmental or nonprofit
corporation purposes, regardless of the zoning classification, shall be limited to the total cost of
construction for a maximum storm sewer size able to handle up to 15 cubic feet per second of
stormwater flow. The assessment rate for all other property uses shall be subject to the total cost of
construction regardless of the storm sewer size.
Storm sewer installations on streets with curb and gutter shall not be subject to special assessments.
(8) Connection charges when assessment not permitted. In the event that the city shall be required by law or
court decision to provide the services described in subsection (3) of this section to property outside the
corporate limits, and where section 13-99 of this Code does not apply, there shall be a connection charge
made equal to the amount which would have been otherwise assessed. No such connection shall be
permitted until such connection charges are paid or secured in a manner satisfactory to the city.
Connection charges shall be paid in one lump sum and shall not be subject to Subsection (9), Terms for
repayment of special assessments, below.
(9) Terms for repayment of special assessments. The following terms shall be used in the repayment of special
assessments:
• $ 0.00 - $ 500.00 90 days from date of receipt of invoice of final assessments
without interest, or until the next property tax bill is due with interest
accrued from the date of the final invoice.

invoice for all types of construction.
• Over $5,000 90 days from date of receipt of invoice of final assessments
without interest. If not paid in full, remaining balance will be added to the
tax bill in 20 equal payments with interest accrued from the date of the final
invoice for all types of construction.
a) Upon sale or conveyance by deed of any property subject to a special assessment which is authorized to be
paid in installments and which has been placed on the tax roll, the entire amount of the special assessment
then outstanding shall be immediately due and payable and shall not be assumed by the purchaser of the
property, except as provided for in subsection (b) below. In the event of nonpayment, the entire outstanding
special assessment balance shall be placed on the next ensuing tax roll and collected in the same manner as
taxes upon real estate. Following such a conveyance, the city clerk shall make appropriate modifications to
the city's special assessment roll and records to reflect such change. The entire balance of special
assessments must be paid when property subject to a special assessment is divided by re-platting in a
certified survey map or any portion of the land subject to a special assessment is sold or conveyed by a
separate legal description.

consideration except stock of the corporation or an interest in the partnership and if, in the case of
transfers from corporations, the corporation owned the property for at least three years.
11. To a trust if a transfer from the grantor to the beneficiary of the trust would be exempt from this
section.
12. Between a limited liability company and its shareholders if all of the stock is owned by, or all the
partners are, spouses or lineal ascendants or descendants of each other, if the transfer is for no
consideration except stock of the corporation or an interest in the partnership and if, in the case of
transfers from limited liability companies the limited liability company owned the property for at least
three years.
c) In the event that a parcel subject to special assessments is subdivided by plat or certified survey map and
the remaining balance of special assessment due is in excess of $10,000, said balance may be divided
among the newly created parcels on a prorated basis. Any prorated special assessments shall remain on the
same payment schedule as the special assessments on the original parcel except if the prorated special
assessment is $500 or less, in which case, the prorated special assessment shall be paid in full within 90
days of the date of proration or until the next property tax bill is due. Interest shall continue to accrue at the
original rate for all prorated special assessments.

Secs. 13-100 Request for Relief from Special Assessment Charges
1) Purpose - The Common Council acknowledges that the levy of special assessments per Section 13-96 of the
Municipal Code can result in extreme financial hardship in some instances. It therefore enacts this provision in
order to provide necessary relief to persons affected by such a levy. It is the intent and purpose of the Common
Council to mitigate the burden of such levies in cases where the loss of the homestead is a reasonable
probability, while preserving the right for the ultimate collection of special assessments involved.

reasonably necessary for use as a home, except so much of such land as is vacant and of sufficient size so
that it could be divided and sold for development as permitted under appropriate zoning and other
regulations. Properties in whole or in part which are utilized as rental properties are ineligible for hardship
provisions of this ordinance.

committee, constitute an undue hardship on the homestead occupant.
5) Applications for a deferment or extended installments under this section shall be filed with the City Clerk in
writing upon forms provided by the City within 60 days of the mailing of estimated special assessments. The
written notice to the clerk shall state the reasons the owner of the homestead is requesting relief. If during the

If a licensed contractor or other person has installed or caused to be installed any wiring devices, apparatus or

Sec. 17-43. Electrical inspection.
(1) Notification. Upon completion of the performance of any electrical work for which a permit is required
under the terms of this chapter, and before any such work is hidden from view, the permittee shall notify
the electrical inspector's office. The inspector shall inspect such work within two business days after such

is otherwise safe, he or she shall approve the work. The work can then be covered and/or completed. If the
inspector determines that the work is otherwise than in compliance with this subsection, he or she shall
order the permittee to make such changes or additions as may be necessary, to be completed within a period
of ten days. When such changes or additions have been made, the electrical inspector shall be notified, and
shall reinspect the work. The inspector's office shall be notified at least two business days before covering
any wiring or before occupancy takes place for work completed under provisions of this chapter.
(2) Reinspection. The electrical inspector shall have the authority to reinspect any electrical work wherever and
whenever he or she deems it necessary.

Sec. 17-44. Homeowner's privilege.
(1) Permits. No person shall wire his or her home or any part thereof, or make any changes or additions to the
wiring therein without first securing permission from the electrical inspector. The inspector shall determine
whether such person has sufficient knowledge of the work contemplated in order to do such work in a
proper manner. The inspector may issue a permit for such work. The only type of person contemplated
under this section is a property owner installing electrical wiring in a single-family residential dwelling
which is owned and occupied by such person at the time the work is to be completed, is their legal
residence, and is not for sale or for rent in whole or part. Only State licensed Electrical Constractors may
install, repair, or do work on electrical services.
(2) Affidavits. Prior to receiving the permit for electrical work, and as a condition thereto, the homeowner shall
execute an affidavit certifying that all of the electrical work shall be done by himself at the premises
concerned and it will fully conform in all respects with the requirements of the state and city electrical
codes and all pertinent ordinances of the city. The city and the electrical inspector are absolved from any
liability because of a noncompliance of any such electrical work with the requirements of such codes
and/or ordinances.
(3) Inspections. At least two business days before any electrical construction is concealed the owner must
request an inspection of that part of the electrical construction. At the completion of all work this
nonlicensed person must notify the electrical inspector for a final inspection at least two business days
before this wiring is utilized. Any defects shall be corrected within 15 days after any notification. A refusal
to do so in a timely matter shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

ARTICLE I: INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
Section 18-01: Title
This Chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the City of Marshfield Zoning Ordinance, except
where as referred to herein, where it shall be known as “this Chapter.”
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-02: Authority
This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the State of Wisconsin Statutes. Specific
statutory references are provided within the body of this Chapter solely as a means of assisting the reader.
Such references are not to be considered as all inclusive and shall in no manner be construed so as to limit the
application or interpretation of this Chapter. State Law References: Sections 62.23(7), 62.231, and 87.30,
Wisconsin Statutes.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-03: Purpose and Intent
This Chapter is adopted for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, and
general welfare of the public. This Chapter is designed to control and lessen congestion in the streets; to
secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote adequate light and air; to protect groundwater
resources; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to preserve,
protect, and promote property values; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage,
schools, parks, and other public facilities; and to preserve burial sites as defined in Section 157.70(1)(b),
Wisconsin Statutes. It is also the intent of this Chapter is to implement certain goals and objectives of the
City of Marshfield Comprehensive Plan, which are best addressed through zoning approaches, as enabled by
Wisconsin Statutes.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-04: Separability and Non-Liability
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City of Marshfield Common Council that provisions of this
Chapter are separable in accordance with the following:
(1) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this Chapter to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect any other provisions of this Chapter not specifically included in said
judgment.
(2) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any portion of this
Chapter to a particular property, water, building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the
application of said provision to any other property, water, building, or structure not specifically
included in said judgment.
(3) If any requirement or limitation attached to an authorization given under this Chapter is found invalid,
it shall be presumed that the authorization would not have been granted without the requirement or
limitation and, therefore, said authorization shall also be invalid.
(4) The City does not guarantee, warrant, or represent that only those areas designated as floodplain will
be subject to periodic inundation and hereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the City, its
officers, employees, agents, or representatives for any flood damages, sanitation problems, or structural
damages.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-05: Abrogation
Section 18-05: Abrogation
It is not intended that this Chapter abrogate or interfere with any constitutionally protected vested right. It is
also not intended that this Chapter abrogate, repeal, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements,
covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant
to law.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-06: Rules of Interpretation
(1) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare, and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the City and shall not be construed to be a limitation or repeal of any other
power now possessed by the City of Marshfield.
(2) Where property is affected by the regulations imposed by any provision of this Chapter and by other
governmental regulations, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards
or requirements shall prevail. Regardless of any other provision of this Chapter, no land shall be
developed or used, and no structure erected or maintained, in violation of any state or federal
regulations. Where there are conflicts between or among regulations within this Chapter, the
regulations that are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall prevail. In
all instances, where there are conflicts between the text of this Chapter and any tables or figures of this
Chapter, the text shall prevail.
(3) No structure, land, water, or air shall hereafter be used and no structure or part thereof shall hereafter
be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted, or structurally altered
without a building permit, except structures not requiring a building permit (e.g. swing set, clothesline,
etc.), and without full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and all other applicable local,
county, and state regulations.
(4) Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in plans, construction, size, or designated use of
any building or part thereof for which a building permit has been issued before the effective date of
this Chapter, and the construction of which shall have been started within one year from the date of
such permit.
(5) Except as provided in this Chapter, under provisions for nonconforming uses, nonconforming
developments, substandard lots, and nonconforming structures and buildings (See Article V), no
building, structure, development, or premises shall be hereinafter used or occupied, and no applicable
permit granted, that does not conform to the requirements of this Chapter. In cases of mixedoccupancy
or mixed-use, the regulations for each land use shall apply to the portion of the structure or
land so occupied or so used.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-07: Jurisdiction
This Chapter is applicable to all territory located within the corporate limits of the City of Marshfield.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-08: Re-enactment and Repeal
(1) This Chapter, in part, carries forward by re-enactment some of the provisions of the regulations
governing zoning and related matters previously known collectively as the “General Zoning
Ordinance,” Chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Marshfield, adopted prior to the
effective date of this Chapter. It is not the intention of this Chapter to repeal, but rather to re-enact
and continue in force such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued there
Section 18-09: Effective Date
under are preserved and may be enforced, unless explicitly surrendered by specific provisions of this
Chapter or altered by the Official Zoning Map.

Section 18-42: (CD) Campus Development Zoning District
Section 18-42: (CD) Campus Development Zoning District
(1) Intent. This district is intended to recognize the presence and importance of large-scale governmental,
office, educational, medical, and research and development facilities in the City; to facilitate their
development; and to coordinate their futures with those of their neighbors and the community as a
whole. This district is also intended to:
(a) Permit appropriate campus growth, while minimizing adverse impacts associated with
modifications, infill development, and/or expansion;
(b) Recognize the sharing of parking, green space, and other efficiencies that come with integrated
campus planning and development;
(c) Balance the ability of a campus to evolve and the public benefits associated with such
development, with the need to protect the livability and vitality of nearby properties and
neighborhoods; and,
(d) Encourage the preparation of campus master plans that establish full conforming zoning status,
facilitate predictable campus development, and enable nearby property owners, residents and the
community to understand short-term development proposals, impacts and mitigation strategies
within the context of long-term development possibilities.
(2) See Section 18-166 for the process to establish Campus Development Zoning.
(3) See Section 18-166(5) for the Campus Master Plan requirements.
(4) Interim Campus Development Zoning. The following shall apply to properties zoned Campus
Development prior to the adoption of a Campus Master Plan.
(a) All existing land uses, structures, paved areas, and lots are legal conforming, consistent with
Article V.
(b) All future land uses, structures, and paved areas shall be regulated as conditional uses per the
requirements of Section 18-161.
(c) All future development is exempt from the requirements of Section 18-114 Group and Large
Developments.
(5) Land Use Regulations
(a) All land uses and development (including buildings, structures, paved areas, fixtures, landscaping
and signage) existing as of the date of CMP approval which are depicted on the approved
Campus Existing Conditions Graphic and/or listed on the approved Campus Existing
Development Inventory, shall be considered as fully legal, conforming land uses and
development, unless explicitly identified by the City within the CMP approval documentation as
having a legal nonconforming or nonconforming status.
(b) Proposed land uses and development which are located within the Campus Development zoning
district, and which are consistent with the approved Campus Plan Graphic and/Campus Plan
Development Inventory, shall be considered, reviewed and approved prior to the time of their
development, per Section 18-166.
(c) Specific land uses and development within the Campus Development zoning district which are
inconsistent with an approved CMP shall be reviewed as conditional uses. See Section 18-166 for
expired CMPs.
(d) A Planned Development may be proposed, considered and approved within any portion of the
area of an approved CMP, and if approved, shall supersede explicitly approved provisions of the
CMP and the Zoning Ordinance, for the area included within the boundaries of the Planned
Development.
(e) Land Uses which are proposed, but not listed in Article III, shall be subject to the rules of
interpretation and appeals governing the Zoning Ordinance.
Section 18-43: (PD) Planned Development

Section 18-43: (PD) Planned Development
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development
standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district and the other requirements of this
Chapter. In exchange for such flexibility, planned developments shall provide a much higher level of
site design, architectural control, and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally
required for other developments.
(2) Intent. Planned developments are intended to encourage, promote, and provide improved
environmental design by allowing for greater freedom, imagination, and flexibility in the development
of land, while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of this Chapter and the City of
Marshfield Comprehensive Plan. To this end, planned developments allow diversification and variation
in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces, and heights of structures in developments
conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further intended to
encourage economic development and more rational developments with regard to public services and
to encourage and facilitate preservation of open space and natural resources. Planned developments
are not intended to circumvent the intent of other zoning districts or this Chapter. The City also
intends to use the Planned Development district to provide a mechanism for review of traditional
neighborhood developments per State Statute 66.1027.
(3) Applicability.
Sections 18-44 to 18-49: Reserved
(a) Ownership. A tract of land proposed to be developed as a PD shall be under the control of a
single owner, partnership, or corporation, where each owner agrees in advance to be bound by
the conditions and regulations which will be effective within the district and to record such
covenants, easements, and other provisions with the county.
(b) Size. There is no minimum or maximum size for a PD.
(c) Condominium projects with jointly owned common spaces and/or commonly owned structural
walls, roofs, or other structural elements must be approved as PDs if, as a result of a
condominium division of the land, the lot requirements of the district in which the development
is located cannot otherwise be met. This requirement would apply to townhouses where the
resulting lot size would be less than otherwise required.
(4) See Section 18-167 for the process to establish Planned Development Zoning.
(5) See Sections 18-167(3)(c) and 18-167(3)(d) for the General Development Plan and Specific
Implementation Plan requirements.
(6) Planned Developments are exempt from the requirements of Section 18-114 Group and Large
Developments.

ARTICLE III: LAND USE REGULATIONS
Section 18-50: Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to indicate which land uses may locate in each zoning district and under what
requirements; and which land uses may not locate therein. Certain land uses may locate in a given district as a
matter of right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use. A further distinction is made for
land uses which may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a conditional use or temporary use permit.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-51: Regulation of Allowable Uses
The allowable land uses for each zoning district are established in Article II of this Chapter. Detailed
descriptions and regulations for uses are found in Sections 18-55 through 18-66. Even if a land use may be
indicated as permitted by right or requiring a conditional use in a particular district, such a land use may not
necessarily be permitted or permissible on any or every property in such district. No land use is permitted or
permissible on a property unless it can be located on it or implemented in full compliance with all of the
applicable standards and regulations of this Chapter or unless an appropriate variance has been granted
pursuant to Section 18-165. For land uses not specifically listed, the Zoning Administrator shall make an
interpretation to determine if an amendment to this Chapter is necessary.
(1) Principal Land Uses Permitted by Right. Principal land uses listed as permitted by right (designated by
the letter “P” in Section 18-54) are permitted per the general land use requirements of this Article; per
the density, intensity, and bulk regulations of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per
any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay districts; per all other applicable
requirements of this Chapter; and per any and all other applicable City, county, state, and federal
regulations. In some instances, permitted uses may be considered accessory uses as determined by the
Zoning Administrator.
(2) Principal Land Uses Permitted as Conditional Uses. Principal land uses allowed only with a conditional
use permit (designated by the letter “C” in Section 18-54) may be permitted subject to all the
requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in Subsection (1), above, plus any additional
requirements applicable to that particular land use imposed as part of the conditional use permit
process established in Section 18-161. Each application for, and instance of, a conditional use shall be

covers or otherwise obscured areas.
NOTE: The incorporation of this Subsection into this Chapter is designed to reflect the Common
Council’s official finding that sexually-oriented commercial uses have a predominant tendency to
produce certain undesirable secondary effects on the surrounding community, as has been
demonstrated in other, similar jurisdictions. Specifically, the Common Council is concerned with the
potential for such uses to limit: the attractiveness of nearby locations for new development, the ability
to attract and/or retain customers, and the ability to market and sell nearby properties at a level
consistent with similar properties not located near such facilities. It is explicitly not the intent of this
Subsection to suppress free expression by unreasonably limiting alternative avenues of communication,
but rather to balance the need to protect free expression opportunities with the need to implement the
City’s Comprehensive Plan and protect the character and integrity of its commercial and residential
neighborhoods.
Regulations:
(a) Facilities shall be located a minimum of 1,000 feet from any commercially zoned property or
residentially zoned property; and shall be located a minimum of 1,000 feet from any school,
church, or outdoor recreational facility.
(b) Exterior building appearance and signage shall be designed to ensure that the use does not
detract from the ability of businesses in the vicinity to attract customers, nor affect the
marketability of properties in the vicinity for sale at their assessed values.
(c) Minimum required parking: One space per 350 square feet of gross floor area, or one space per
person at the maximum capacity of the establishment, whichever is greater.

except where exempted by the provisions of this Section.
(2) Front Yard or Street Side Setback Adjustments.
(a) A front yard and street side yard setback may be reduced to the mean of the setbacks of the
immediately adjoining lots that are on either or both sides of the subject lot. The following rules
apply in calculating the mean setback (see Figure 18-72):
1. Only the setbacks on 5 or fewer adjoining lots, are contiguous to each other in either
direction of the subject lot, and are on the same side of the street as each other may be used.
Properties separated by a cross street may be used in the average calculation.

vacant lot and factored into the averaging calculation.
3. Outliers shall be excluded in calculating the mean setback as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
4. In residential districts, the depth of the minimum front yard and side street side yard on any
lot shall be at least 15 feet and the minimum setback for an attached or detached garage

Section 18-74: Exceptions to Maximum Height Regulations
The maximum height regulations listed for residential and nonresidential uses and accessory buildings in each
zoning district in Article II are the maximum permitted heights for all buildings and structures, except those
exempted by this Section except as prohibited by the Height Limitation Zoning Map, Marshfield Municipal
Airport, Marshfield, Wisconsin.
(1) The following are permitted to exceed the maximum height regulations within any district where
permitted: spires, belfries, cupolas, penthouses and domes, not used for human occupancy; public
monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers, flag poles, chimneys, ventilators, skylights, similar
features, and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above roof level.
(2) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to prevent the erection above the building height limit of
a parapet wall or cornice for ornament (and without windows) extending above such height limit not
more than 5 feet. Such features, however, shall be erected only to such height as is necessary to
accomplish the purpose they are to serve and subject to the Wisconsin state building code.
(3) Height extensions for certain public buildings and institutions. Public and semi-public hospitals,
institutions, schools, or public utility and service buildings, when permitted in a residential district, may
be erected to a height not exceeding 75 feet, provided such specified buildings shall be set back from
the front, rear and side lot lines on the ratio of 2 feet for every one foot of building height greater than
40 feet. Such specified requirements, however, shall apply in addition to the other requirements for
building line setbacks and for rear and side yards specifically set forth in this chapter.
(4) The Plan Commission may grant exceptions to the height limitations for any building or structure not
otherwise accounted for in this section or may set the maximum height of a structure on an individual
lot as a conditional use and may set special requirements as part of the approval under the terms and
conditions of this chapter. Such features, however, shall be erected only to such height as is necessary
to accomplish the purpose they are to serve and subject to the Wisconsin state building code.

ARTICLE V: NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Section 18-80: Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to establish regulations for the following nonconforming situations:
nonconforming uses, substandard lots, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming sites created legally
prior to the effective date of this Chapter (January 1, 2013).
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-81: Nonconforming Uses
(1) The following section shall apply to all uses in the City except in the following circumstances:
(a) The use did not legally exist at the time of adoption.
(b) The use is subject to legal proceedings.
(c) The use is subject to a court order to the contrary of this Section.
(2) Continuance of a Nonconforming Use.
(a) Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this Chapter, or any
amendment to it, may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such
date, except as specified in this Section.
(b) A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, either permitted
by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of this Chapter, shall be considered a
legal, conforming land use so long as any previously approved conditions of use and site plan are
followed. Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall
require application and City consideration under the requirements of Section 18-161.
(c) Any prior legal use made nonconforming by this Chapter, or by an amendment to it, may be
granted legal conforming status and allowed to be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or
substituted by the issuance of a conditional use permit, subject to the standards and procedures
prescribed by Section 18-161.
(3) Modification of a Nonconforming Use.
(a) Except as permitted in Subsection (c), below, or Subsection (2)(c), above, a nonconforming use
shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, or reconstructed, unless the use is changed to a use
permitted in the district in which the use is located.
(b) Substitution of new equipment shall be permitted.
(c) A nonconforming nonresidential use not served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water
may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if
either or both facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject property and a
conditional use permit is granted for such expansion.
(4) Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use. When any nonconforming use of any land, building, or
structure is discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed into a conforming use,
any future use of said land, building, or structure shall be in complete conformity with the provisions
of this Chapter.
(5) Maintenance and Repair of a Nonconforming Use.
(a) The ordinary maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts of the
nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this Chapter.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, whenever a nonconforming use is damaged to the
extent of more than 50 percent of its current equalized assessed value, it shall not be restored
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-82: Nonconforming and Substandard Lots
(1) The following section shall apply to all lots in the City except in the following circumstances:
(a) The lot did not legally exist as of the effective date of this Chapter
(b) The lot is subject to legal proceedings.
(c) The lot is subject to a court order to the contrary of this Section.
(2) Blanket Conforming Status.
(a) Blanket conforming status for any and all requirements of this Chapter is hereby automatically
granted to all nonconforming or substandard lots in their configuration existing or as finally
approved as of the effective date of this Chapter. This Subsection ensures that lots approved and
created prior to the adoption of this Chapter do not encounter difficulty because the lots would
otherwise be considered nonconforming or substandard.
(b) After the effective date of this Chapter, no lot shall be created which does not meet the density,
intensity, and bulk requirements of the zoning district per Article II.
(3) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this Chapter in any zoning district, which does not
meet the minimum lot area, width, and frontage requirements for the zoning district, may be utilized
for new or modified development, provided that such development complies with all of the density,
intensity, and bulk regulations for that zoning district.
(4) Abutting vacant substandard lots under the same ownership must be combined prior to development
per Section 18-168.
(5) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this Chapter in the RH-35 zoning district which is
less than 35 acres in area and which has no dwelling units may be utilized for one detached single
family dwelling unit.
(6) Except for outlots that received variances prior to the effective date of this Chapter, this section shall
not apply to outlots without access to a public right of way that existed prior to the effective date of
this Chapter since they are not intended for development.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-83: Nonconforming Structures
(1) The following section shall apply to all structures in the City except in the following circumstances:
(a) The structure did not legally exist at the time of adoption.
(b) The structure is subject to legal proceedings.
(c) The structure is subject to a court order to the contrary of this Section.
(d) Chapter 20 Shorelands-Wetlands of the City of Marshfield Code of Ordinances shall control in
case of a conflict.
(2) Blanket Conforming Status.
(a) Blanket conforming status for any and all requirements of this Chapter is hereby automatically
granted to any structure lawfully existing upon the effective date of this Chapter. After the
effective date of this Chapter except where permitted in Sec. 18-73, structures may not be
enlarged, expanded, or extended without bringing the enlargement, expansion, or extension into
compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, or unless a variance is granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals under Section 18-165.
(b) This Subsection is intended to eliminate the continued classification and/or creation of
structures as nonconforming subject to the requirements of this Chapter. This provision
addresses 2 different situations.
1. Any structure erected prior to the adoption of zoning that does not meet some or all of the
bulk or intensity requirements of this Chapter.
2. In some instances, this Chapter establishes new bulk or intensity requirements that existing
legal structures under the previous zoning ordinance do not meet.
(c) This Section therefore ensures that owners of such structures legally established prior to the
effective date of this Chapter do not encounter difficulty because the structures would otherwise
be considered nonconforming.
(3) The following shall apply to all structures that do not meet bulk and other requirements of this
Chapter.
(a) Ordinary Maintenance. Ordinary maintenance repairs, including repairs reasonably necessary to
prevent the deterioration of a structure, and remodeling of a structure are permitted, as well as
necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the
structure. Ordinary maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and external painting,
decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the installation of heating, electricity,
plumbing (including fixtures) or insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other
non-structural components.
(b) Interior Alterations.
1. Interior structural alterations may be made, provided such alterations do not increase the
number of dwelling units. A conforming garage may be added if none previously existed.
(c) Additions. Additions, expansions, and enlargements may be added . However, after the effective
date of this Chapter, such additions must meet the requirements of this Chapter unless a variance
is granted under Section 18-165.
(d) Destruction and Reconstruction.
1. A damaged, destroyed, or removed structure may be restored to the size, location, design
and use that it had immediately before the damage, destruction, or removal occurred without
any limits on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or improvement if either 1. or 2.,
below, apply. The burden of proof in regard to the location, dimensions, configuration, and
exterior building materials of the damaged or removed structure shall be upon the property
owner to demonstrate prior to the issuance of a building permit.
a. The structure was damaged or destroyed by violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice,

Section 18-84: Nonconforming Sites
(1) Blanket Conforming Status.
(a) Blanket conforming status for any and all requirements of this Chapter is hereby automatically
granted to all development sites in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the
effective date of this Chapter.
(b) After the effective date of this Chapter, additional site development that would result in the
enlargement, expansion, or extension of uses or structures will not be allowed to occur without
bringing the enlargement into full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, or to the
extent practical without removal of lawful structures in accordance with the following
Subsections (c) through (f), below.
(c) This Subsection is intended to prevent the creation of nonconforming sites related to the
building and site design requirements of this Chapter. These building and site design
components may include one or more of the following:
1. Bulk, intensity, and density requirements.
2. Exterior building materials requirements.
3. Exterior building design requirements.
4. Parking, loading, access drive and other paved area design requirements.
5. Landscaping requirements.
6. Bufferyard requirements.
7. Fencing requirements.
8. Lighting requirements.
(d) This Subsection ensures that sites approved prior to the effective date of this Chapter do not
encounter difficulty because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming.
(2) All new buildings, structures, and parking areas, including additions, shall comply with all site design
requirements of this Chapter for the new portion of the development. See Section 18-133 for specific
regulations for addressing street frontage landscaping.
(3) On lots where the site configuration and undeveloped area are sufficient to comply with site design
requirements, no enlargement, expansion, or extension of a use, structure, or paving shall be permitted
if it makes compliance with the site design requirements of this Chapter impossible, even if said
enlargement, expansion, or extension of the use, structure, or paving would otherwise be permissible.
(4) On lots where the configuration and undeveloped area of the nonconforming site provides insufficient
space to bring the site into full compliance with all site requirements but nevertheless provides space to
reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities, the Plan Commission shall make a determination
as to the manner and degree to which each site nonconformities shall be brought into conformance.
(5) Enlargements, expansions, or extensions that would result in creation of one or more nonconformities,
render a nonconforming site incapable of being brought into full or greater compliance with
nonconforming site requirements, or increase the degree of existing nonconformities with the site
development standards of this Chapter shall not be permitted, unless a variance is granted by the
Zoning Board of Appeals under Section 18-165.

which avoids congestion on public streets and other safety hazards. Traffic into and out of all offstreet
parking, loading, and traffic circulation areas serving 6 or more parking spaces shall be forward
moving, with no backing into streets or pedestrian ways. Traffic control devices shall be required as
approved by the City Engineer.
(8) Traffic Study: If it is determined by the City Engineer or Plan Commission that a proposed
nonresidential development will have a substantial impact to traffic, the City may require that a traffic
impact analysis be completed in accordance with the most current revision of the Traffic Impact
Analysis Guidelines published by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. It shall be conducted
by a third party agreed upon by both the applicant and City at the applicant's expense. The
components of the traffic impact analysis shall be determined by the City Engineer or Plan
Commission.
(9) Depiction on Required Site Plan. Any and all proposed access drives on the subject property shall be
depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan required for the development of the
subject property.
(10) Paving of Access. All access approach areas located within a street right of way shall be paved to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer with a hard, all-weather surface, and shall be maintained so as to
prevent the transport of gravel, dirt, or other eroded material from the subject property into the right
of way. When the street has curb and gutter the hard surface between the right of way and the curb
shall be concrete. This requirement must be fulfilled before building occupancy to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-102: Visibility Standards
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public and private rightsof-

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public rights-of-way so as
to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the
provision of off-street parking and circulation.
(2) Applicability. The requirements of this Section shall apply to all new development. Any parking
requirements may be modified, reduced, or waived by the Plan Commission with the issuance of a
conditional use permit.
(3) Review and Approval. Through the site plan review process (see Section 18-164), the Zoning
Administrator shall review and approve all development for conformance with this Section.
(4) Depiction on Required Site Plan. Any and all parking and traffic circulation areas proposed to be
located on the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan
required for the development of the subject property. A garage stall, meeting the access requirements
of Subsection (6)(d), below, shall be considered a parking space.
(5) Minimum Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. Off-street parking requirements for each land use (see
Article III) are generally tied to the use’s capacity and gross floor area or the number of employees at
the subject property during the largest work shift. The term “capacity” means the maximum number
of persons that may be accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by state building code
regulations, whichever number is greater. The term “employee(s) on the largest work shift” means the
maximum number of employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time
period during which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such person is a full-time employee.
The largest work shift may occur on any particular day of the week or during a lunch or dinner period
in the case of a restaurant. In all cases, one reserved parking space shall be provided for each vehicle
used by the operation during business hours. Where said parking needs of any land use exceed the
minimum requirements of this Chapter, additional parking spaces sufficient to meet the average
maximum weekly peak-hour parking space demand shall be provided by said land use.
(6) Parking Requirements for New Development and Change of Land Use.
(a) All required parking for new development, including aisles, must be provided on-site and hard
surfaced within one year of occupancy.
(b) All additional required parking, new parking areas, aisles, and/or new access points, for a change
in land use that triggers an increase in the parking requirements, must be provided on-site and
hard surfaced within one year of occupancy.
(c) All new parking areas, including aisles, must be provided on-site and hard surfaced within one
year of occupancy.
(7) Off-Street Parking and Traffic Circulation Standards.
(a) Circulation. The site shall be designed to provide for the safe and efficient movement of all
traffic entering, exiting, and circulating on the site. Circulation patterns shall conform to the
general rules of the road. All traffic control measures shall meet the requirements of the Manual
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices or other requirements as determined by the City Engineer.
(b) Surfacing and Marking. All new and expanded off-street parking and traffic circulation areas
(including all residential driveways) shall be paved with a hard, all-weather or other surface to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer. Said surfaces intended for 10 or more parking stalls shall be
marked in a manner which clearly indicates required parking spaces.
1. The following are exempt from the surfacing requirements in (b) above.
a. All driveways in the RH-35 district.
b. Driveways where the only access is through a non-paved alley.
c. Parking areas subject to code enforcement or legal proceedings as of the effective date
of this Chapter.
(c) Access. Except for single family and two family dwellings, each off-street parking space shall
open directly upon an aisle or driveway that is wide enough and designed to provide a safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space without directly backing or maneuvering
a vehicle into a street on a public right-of-way of 60 feet in width or greater. All off-street
parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate means of vehicular
access to a street or alley, in a manner which least interferes with traffic movements. All new
access aprons from the street to the edge of sidewalk or right-of-way shall be paved with a hard,
all-weather or other surface to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
(d) Snow Storage. Required off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall not be used for snow
storage. Snow storage shall not adversely affect any abutting property owner.
(e) Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving 10 or more cars shall be lit so
as to ensure the safe and efficient use of said areas during the hours of use. The illumination level
shall not exceed the standards of Section 18-104. In addition, light bulbs on the subject property
shall not be visible from residentially zoned property.
(f) Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required off-street parking or traffic circulation
shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 24 of the City of Marshfield Code of Ordinances.
(g) Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the requirements of the paved area
landscaping requirements in Article X.
(h) Parking Space Design Standards. Other than handicapped parking, each off-street parking space
shall comply with the minimum requirements of Figure 18-103(b). The minimum required length
of parking spaces shall be 18 feet. All parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of
at least 9 feet. The Zoning Administrator may grant exceptions to these standards.
(i) Handicapped Parking Spaces. Handicapped parking shall be provided at a size, number, location,
and with signage as specified by state and federal regulations.
(j) Parking Lot Design Standards. Horizontal widths for parking rows, aisles, and modules shall be
provided at widths no less than listed in Figure 18-103(b). The parking lot must also adhere to
the design standards for landscaping found in Section 18-133(2)(d). Additional design standards
may apply to group developments and/or large developments (See Section 18-114).
(k) Partial or Phased Development of Required Parking Spaces. Any development may seek
permission to not install a portion of its required parking at time of site plan review; however,
the site plan shall depict the minimum number of required parking spaces.
(8) Joint and Cooperative Parking Facilities.
(a) Parking facilities which have been approved by the City Engineer to provide required parking for
one or more uses shall provide a total number of parking spaces which shall not be less than the
sum total of the separate parking needs for each use during any peak hour parking period when
said joint parking facility is utilized at the same time by said uses. However, this aggregate
requirement may be reduced or expanded if part of a cooperative parking facility, the Zoning
Administrator approves a reduction under Section 18-103(15), or the total number of required
parking is reduced by the Plan Commission through a conditional use permit.
(b) The applicant(s) for approval of a joint parking facility shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer that there is no substantial conflict in the demand for parking during the
principal operating hours of the two of more uses for which the joint parking facility is proposed
to serve.
(c) Cooperative parking facility. Up to 15 percent reduction in the number of required parking
spaces for 4 or more separate uses; 10 percent for 3 separate uses; and 5 percent for 2 separate
uses may be authorized by the administrator following approval of a plan which provides for a
collective parking facility of no less than 15,000 square feet, serving 2 or more buildings or uses,
developed through voluntary cooperation or under any parking district which may hereafter be
provided by law.
(d) Joint but alternate use. The administrator may authorize the joint use of parking facilities under
the following conditions:
1. Up to 50 percent of the parking facilities by nighttime uses may be supplied by the off-street
parking facilities of daytime uses.
2. Up to 50 percent of the parking facilities of daytime uses may be supplied by the off-street
parking facilities of nighttime uses.
3. Up to 100 percent of the parking facilities of a church or auditorium incidental to a grade
school may be supplied by the off-street parking facilities of daytime uses.
4. For the purposes of this section, daytime uses are defined as offices, banks, retail stores,
personal service or repair shops, household equipment or furniture stores, manufacturing or
wholesale, or similar primarily daytime uses; and nighttime uses are defined as auditoriums
incidental to grade schools, churches, bowling alleys, dancehalls, theaters, bars or restaurants,
motels, or similar primarily nighttime or Sunday uses and R-8 and R-9 nonelderly,
multifamily housing.
5. Conditions required for joint use shall be as follows:
a. The building or use for which application is being made to utilize the off-street parking
facilities provided by another building or use shall be located within 500 feet of such
parking facilities or a longer distance as permitted by the plan commission through a
conditional use permit.
b. The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating
hours of the two buildings or uses for which joint use of off-street parking facilities is
proposed.
c. A properly drawn legal instrument, executed by the parties concerned for joint use of
off-street parking facilities, duly approved as to form and manner of execution by the
city attorney, shall be filed with the administrator. Joint use parking privileges shall
continue in effect only so long as such an instrument, binding on all parties, remains in
force. If such instrument becomes legally ineffective, then parking shall be provided as
otherwise required in this chapter.
(9) Locational Prohibitions for Off-Street Parking Areas.
(a) Off-street parking on a residential lot shall not be located between the principal structure and a
street right of way, except within residential driveways, parking pads, and parking lots designated
on the approved site plan.
(b) Except in the DMU and UMU districts, there shall be a minimum 10 foot setback for any
driveway width additions or parking pads in the front and street side yards. See Figure 18-103(a).
Driveways adjacent to alleys are exempt from this requirement.
Figure 18-103(a): Minimum Driveway Expansion and Parking Pad Setback
(10) Throat Length. The throat length for all new nonresidential and new multiple family residential
development shall be reviewed and determined by the City Engineer based upon traffic patterns and
safety concerns.
(11) Potential Reduction in Parking. The Plan Commission may decrease the required number of off-street
automobile parking spaces based upon technical documentation furnished by the applicant that
indicates, to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission, that actual off-street parking demand for that
particular use is less than the required standard set forth in this Chapter.
(12) Installation and Maintenance. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall be completed
within one year of use of the parking and circulation areas and shall be constructed of a hard surface or
other material approved by the City Engineer. In no instance shall any required off-street parking or
traffic circulation area be used as a storage area, except as provided for by Section 18-105. The City
Engineer may require the property owner to replace portions of parking areas in disrepair.
(13) Setbacks. The distance from an off street parking area to the property line of an abutting property shall
not be less than 3 feet, as measured along the property line, except for existing driveways, driveways on
lots of 50 feet in width or less, and shared driveways. Existing parking areas may be maintained,
repaired, or replaced at their setback as of the effective date of this chapter. Parking areas and the edge
of driveway additions (see armpit definition) shall have a 10 foot setback from the front and street yard
property line.
(14) Parking requirement exceptions. Exceptions to parking requirements shall be as follows:
(a) DMU Downtown Mixed Use exception. The Plan Commission may grant exceptions, through
the issuance of a conditional use permit, to the off-street parking requirements in the DMU
district, where, because of small lot sizes or historic development patterns, it is either impractical
or infeasible to meet the provisions of this section.
(b) Elderly housing developments. The Plan Commission may grant exceptions, through the
issuance of a conditional use permit, to the off-street parking requirements for certain elderly
housing developments where the developer can successfully demonstrate that automobile
ownership will be sufficiently low so that the required number of stalls would be unnecessary. In
no instance may the number of stalls be reduced to less than 0.5 per dwelling unit.
(c) Off-site parking. The Plan Commission may grant exceptions, through the issuance of a
conditional use permit, whenever required parking and loading spaces cannot be located on a
parcel because of development restrictions imposed by the presence of an existing principal
structure which is to continue in use or to other conditions requiring off-parcel parking and to
the distance requirements in Subsections (7)(c)1 and (7)(c)2 of this section. Required parking may
then be provided off the parcel, for permitted uses only, subject to the following requirements:
1. If the use is residential, hotel, motel, or tourist home, the off-site spaces shall be within 200
feet of the principal entrance or the entrance for individual occupants for whom spaces are
reserved.
2. If the use is other than residential, hotel, motel or tourist home, the farthest portion of the
parking lot shall be within 1,000 feet of an entrance to the establishment.
3. Distances indicated in Subsections (15)(c)1 and (15)(c)2 of this section shall be measured
along routes generally available to the pedestrians involved.
4. Off-site parking areas shall be held in fee simple by the same owner as the use requiring the
off-street parking space, or under lease, rental, or other form of agreement satisfactory to the
plan commission with respect to ensuring continuing availability for required off-site parking
for the use.
(d) Hard-surfacing. The Plan Commission may grant exceptions, through the issuance of a
conditional use permit, to temporarily or permanently wave the hard-surfacing requirements of
this Section.
(e) Setbacks. The Plan Commission may grant exceptions, through the issuance of a conditional use
permit, reduce or wave the setback requirements of this Section (18-103).
(a) Other exceptions to the parking requirements may be granted by the Plan Commission through
the issuance of a conditional use permit. Exceptions may only be granted where unique
circumstances exist and extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict
compliance with this section and further provided that such exception shall not impair the
general purposes of this section and the overall chapter.
(15) The Zoning Administrator may allow a reduction in the number of parking spaces constructed
provided that the applicant can demonstrate on a site plan that the property has enough room to
accommodate the required parking spaces.

(2) Where determinations can be made by the Zoning Administrator using equipment normally available
to the City or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before
notice of violations is issued.
(3) Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the City to maintain
the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, the following
procedures shall be available for causing corrections or apparent violations of performance standards,
for protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement
of performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for
administration and enforcement.
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by certified mail or other means, ensuring a
signed receipt for such notice to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violations. The
notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the Zoning
Administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
(b) The notice shall state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or to correct the alleged
violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within the time limit set constitutes
admission of violation of the terms of this Chapter. The notice shall further state that upon
request of those to whom it is directed, technical determination as described in this Chapter will
be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged
against those responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be

(ORD 1240, 11/30/12; ORD 1265, 2/11/14)
Section 18-133: Landscape Planting Requirements
Landscape plants shall be provided based on the following requirements for street frontages, parking areas,
and bufferyards.
(1) General Requirements.
(a) These requirements are additive to each other and any other landscape or screening requirements
in this Article.
(b) For new and redevelopment (not including additions to buildings or expansions to parking areas)
landscape planting point values may be doubled for existing landscape plants that are retained
and protected with the development of the site.
(c) In calculating the number of required landscape points under the provisions of this Article, all
areas and distances which required calculations shall be prorated calculations and rounded up to
the nearest whole number. Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this Article
shall be rounded up to the next whole plant (for example: 23.3 large trees would be rounded up
to 24 large trees).
(d) Required landscaping for one landscape area may not be double counted towards meeting the
requirements for a different landscape area (for example: required landscaping for one bufferyard
may not be counted towards the minimum requirements for another bufferyard, parking area, or
street frontage).
(e) Points allocated to plants that are located within multiple required landscape areas (such as a tree
along the street frontage that is also within the bufferyard) may be prorated to count towards
each requirement (for example: a large tree worth 40 points located within the bufferyard and
along the street frontage, 20 points could count towards the bufferyard and 20 points could
count towards the street frontage) provided the minimum requirements for each landscape area
are still met.
(f) Utility Easements. Landscape materials, fences and berms located within a duly recorded utility
or a pedestrian easement may only count toward meeting the landscape requirement if
authorized otherwise by the City and applicable utilities. The width of such areas may be counted
as part of a landscape requirement.
(g) Other Open Space Areas. Open space areas not used for landscape plantings other than natural
resource protection areas shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable
turf grass, restored to native vegetation, or maintained in crop production if already being
farmed. Mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable provided that such mulching consists
of organic or natural materials.
(2) Street Frontages.
(a) For every 100 linear feet of street frontage of a developed lot abutting a public street, the
landscape plants installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscape points specified in
Figure 18-133(a).
(b) Plantings shall generally be dispersed along the street frontage.
(c) Street frontage landscaping shall be placed so that any edge of the plants mature drip line is
located within the required front/street side yard for the underlying zoning district or if
permitted, within the public right-of-way.
(d) Landscape plants shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. See Section 18-102.
(e) For new structure additions where the minimum landscape requirement is not being met,
landscape points shall be based on the linear frontage of the addition visible from a public street
measured parallel to the right-of-way line.
(f) If the street frontage landscaping already meets the requirements for the existing and new
development, no additional landscaping is required.
(g) The City may allow the street frontage landscape plants to be placed within the right-of-way.
Installation of plants within the right-of-way must follow the requirements of the Public Works
Department.
(3) Parking Areas (including circulation and loading areas).
(a) For every 20 off-street surface parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of parking area including
circulation and loading areas (whichever yields the greater landscape requirement), landscape
plants shall at a minimum meet the number of landscape points specified in Figure 18-133(a).
(b) Plantings shall generally be dispersed adjacent to or throughout the parking areas.
(c) Parking area landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, any portion of the plant’s drip line or
the edge of an interior parking landscape area (trees, perennials and/or shrubs) is located within
10 feet of the parking area. Landscape parking areas do not have to be provided in one
contiguous area.
(d) Parking Lot Design.
1. Parking spaces must be broken up by a landscaped island/peninsula at the rate of one
island/peninsula for each linear row of 12 parking spaces for single-row, or for each 24
parking spaces in double row configurations. Parking rows with cart returns are allowed up
to 16 parking spaces for single-row, or 32 parking spaces for double row configurations (cart
return areas are not counted as parking spaces).
2. All landscaped islands/peninsulas with trees shall have a minimum width of 7 feet as
measured from the back of the curb or edger.
3. All landscaped islands/peninsulas without trees, but planted with shrubs and/or perennials,
shall have a minimum width of 3 feet measured from the back of the curb or edger.
(e) For new additions to parking areas, landscape points shall be based on the number of new
additional parking stalls or the square footage of new parking area added (whichever yields the
greater landscape requirement).
(4) Bufferyards. A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an
area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or
reduce existing or potential nuisances (e.g. dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, and incompatible land uses,
buildings, or parking areas).
(a) The required level of bufferyard opacity is listed in Figure 18-133(b). Detailed bufferyard
requirements are listed in Figure 18-133(c). Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which
indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the abutting property. The required
level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of
development differs between different zoning districts.
(b) Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two
different zoning districts abut one another or along abutting properties eligible for buffering
according to Article III or Figure 18-133(b). The bufferyard with the greatest opacity applies.
(c) Bufferyards are not required along public rights-of-way unless otherwise required in Article III.
(d) Bufferyards are not required for existing development.
(e) Existing developed areas may continue to be utilized at their present location.
(f) Required landscape points and fences for new development shall be placed to provide screening
between the new development and the abutting property.
(g) Plantings shall generally be dispersed throughout the required or provided bufferyard.
(h) Bufferyard fencing.
1. Bufferyard fencing shall be placed within the required or provided bufferyard along the
perimeter of the abutting properties eligible for buffering
2. Bufferyard fencing may be required to extend into the required front yard based on the
parking configuration but may not encroach into the 10 foot setback from the public rightof-
way.
3. Bufferyard fencing in street side yards may not encroach into the 3 foot setback from the
public right-of-way.
(i) The visual screening for bufferyards, without a structural solid fence and a required opacity
greater than 0.4, shall have at least 50% of the required landscape points be a combination of
coniferous species, either shrubs and/or trees.
(j) Bufferyard requirements for new structure and parking additions. Bufferyards are not required
where additions to existing buildings or paved areas are not visible from abutting properties
eligible for buffering.
1. For structure and parking additions parallel to or extending closer to an abutting property
eligible for buffering, landscape points shall be based on the linear frontage of the addition
visible from abutting properties measured parallel along the property line.
2. New structure additions must either meet the required bufferyard setback for the required
opacity or the setback of the existing façade facing the abutting property, whichever is more
permissive.
3. New parking area additions must either meet the required bufferyard setback for the
required opacity or the setback of the existing parking area facing the abutting property,
whichever is more permissive.
4. Required landscape points and fences for additions shall be placed to provide screening
between the new addition and the abutting property when feasible.
(k) Use of Required Bufferyard and Landscaped Areas. Any and all required bufferyards or
landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian,
bike or equestrian trails provided that no required plant material is eliminated; the total width of
the required bufferyard, and the total area of required landscape planting, is maintained; and all
other regulations of this Chapter are met. No parking stalls, buildings, or outdoor display of
storage of materials shall be permitted. Paving in such areas shall be limited to access to, through,
or across the subject property.

(ORD 1240, 11/30/12; ORD 1265, 2/11/14)
Section 18-136: Installation Guidelines
(1) Installation. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this Chapter
shall be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan within 365 days of
the issuance of an occupancy permit or similar approvals for new additions for any new construction
on the subject property, unless a conditional use is approved to allow for greater than 365 days.
(2) Surety.
(a) If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the installation of all required landscape plants
and bufferyard material, the City may require the property owner to sign an instrument agreeing
to install the required landscaping within the 365 day period. If required, the property owner and
shall submit to the City an irrevocable letter of credit or other form of security that is acceptable
by the City sufficient to guarantee completion of the work. Such security shall be provided by the
property owner at the time that the agreement is signed. It shall be in a minimum amount equal
to 110 percent of the estimated actual cost for all of the required landscape elements of the
approved on the site plan and shall specifically guarantee that all such elements shall be made
and installed as approved on the site plan. The costs of the work shall be furnished by the
property and shall be verified by the City. The financial security shall remain in force until all of
the work has been completed and approved by the City. This agreement shall also contain a
statement indicating that the property owner’s failure to comply with the requirements of the
terms of the agreement will constitute a violation of the Chapter and subject the property owner
to a forfeiture upon conviction.
(b) If the required landscape plants and bufferyard materials are to be installed during different
phases of a subdivision development, the developer may furnish for each phase financial security
in an amount sufficient to guarantee completion of the required landscaping and bufferyard work
performed during a particular phase, unless required otherwise.
(c) If the property owner is a governmental unit, it may, in lieu of signing an agreement and
furnishing a guarantee and file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in its behalf,
agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Article.
(3) All remaining portions of the site not covered by buildings, parking areas or landscape plants shall be
graded and seeded or sodded with turf grass or native ground cover unless such vegetation is already
fully established.
(4) The placement of plants and structures shall be depicted on the landscape planting plan submitted to
the City for its approval. Such plant and structure location shall be the decision of each property owner
provided the required landscape materials be selected or located in a manner that does not result in the
creation of a safety or visibility hazard.
(5) A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the Register of Deeds that
an abutting property owner agrees to provide on the immediately abutting portion of his or her land a
partial or full portion of the required landscaping, thereby relieving the developer of the responsibility
of providing the entire landscaping on his property. An abutting property may also agree to wave any
portion of the required bufferyard, thereby relieving the developer from that portion of the required
landscape with a written agreement, recorded with the Register of Deeds and copies of the agreement
provided to the City.
(6) Maintenance. The continual maintenance of all required landscape materials shall be a requirement of
this Chapter and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials and
plants are required. This requirement shall run with the property and shall be binding upon all future
property owners. Development of any or all property following the effective date of this chapter shall
constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this Article. If the
property owner fails to comply with these provisions, the City may enter upon the property for the
purpose of evaluating all required landscape materials, and may specially assess the costs thereof
against the property. A property owner’s failure to comply with this requirement shall also be
considered a violation of this Chapter, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement
procedures and penalties.

find a buyer willing to preserve the structure or site, the owner may petition the Plan
Commission for a rescission of its designation. Such petition shall contain an affidavit under oath
that the person has made reasonable attempts in good faith to find and attract such a buyer, as

purpose of evaluating the petition.
(b) Following the filing of such petition, the commission shall instruct the Historic Preservation
Committee to work with the owner for up to 6 months to locate a buyer who is willing to abide

declaring that the property is a historic structure or site. Such marker shall be easily visible to
pedestrians.
(6) Maintenance. Owners of record of a historic structure, historic site or an improvement in a historic
district shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such improvement and all interior

(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-143: Construction and Alteration
Construction and alteration of historic structures, sites or improvements within a historic district shall be in
accordance with the following:
(1) Certificate of Appropriateness Required. After designation of a historic structure, site or district, no
person shall alter, reconstruct, move or permit any alteration of all or any exterior portion of a historic
structure or site or a property within a historic district unless the Historic Preservation Committee has
recommended and the Plan Commission has approved such work, and the building services supervisor
has issued a certificate of appropriateness. Application for review of construction or alteration shall be
made on a form prepared by the Historic Preservation Committee and available at the building services
supervisor's office. Such an application shall include accompanying plans and specification.
(a) For a building permit involving the exterior architectural appearance of any designated historic
structure or site or a property within a historic district, the building services supervisor shall refer
the application to the Historic Preservation Committee for a certificate of appropriateness within
10 days of receipt of an application.
(b) For alterations of designated historic properties not requiring a building permit, the building
services supervisor shall issue the certificate of appropriateness based on guidelines approved by
the Historic Preservation Committee. If the building services supervisor determines that a
certificate of appropriateness cannot be issued based on guideline criteria, the applicant shall be
referred to the Historic Preservation Committee.
(2) Application Review by Historic Preservation Committee. Upon receipt of an application for a
certificate of appropriateness involving the exterior of a designated structure, site or property within a
historic district, the Historic Preservation Committee shall review the application at its next regular
meeting. The Historic Preservation Committee shall determine if the proposed work would not
detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any feature of the improvement, would harmonize
with the external appearance of the neighboring sites, and, if in a historic district, would conform to
the established preservation plan objectives and design criteria. The Historic Preservation Committee
shall approve or deny the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness within 30 days. The Historic
Preservation Committee may attach certain conditions to its approval. The building services supervisor
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness after approval.
(3) Denial of Application. If an application for a certificate of appropriateness is denied, the Historic
Preservation Committee shall cooperate and work together with the applicant in an attempt to obtain
approval within the guidelines of this Article.
(4) Criteria for Existing Structures and Sites. Criteria for construction or alteration of existing structures
shall be as follows:
(a) The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Rehabilitation, as revised, shall apply to
reconstruction and alteration to existing structures. The current standards are as follows:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires
minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
3. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes
that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or
architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
4. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property shall be preserved.
6. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the
old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial
evidence.
7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
8. Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If
such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a
manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property
and its environment would be unimpaired.
(b) The Historic Preservation Committee may recommend to the Plan Commission additional
guidelines or criteria which are in conformance with generally accepted historic preservation
principles.
(5) New Construction. Criteria for new construction shall be as follows:
(a) The criteria for new construction in historic districts shall be:
1. The mass, volume, height, roof type, materials, size and setback of proposed structures
should appear to be compatible with existing buildings in the immediate area.
2. The facade of new structures should maintain a compatible relationship with those of
existing structures in terms of windowsill or header lines, proportion of window and door
openings, horizontal or vertical emphasis of major building elements, and extent of
architectural detail.
3. The building materials and colors used should complement and be compatible with other
buildings in the immediate area.
4. The sizing, design and placement of signs should fit the building and the adjacent structures.
5. All landscaping and parking provisions should complement and be compatible with
improvements in the immediate area.
(b) The Historic Preservation Committee may recommend to the Plan Commission additional
guidelines or criteria which are in conformance with generally recognized historic preservation
principles.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-144: Demolition
Demolition of locally designated historic building sites and improvements within a historic district shall be in
accordance with the following:
(1) Demolition Permit Required. No person shall demolish all or part of a historic structure or structure
within a historic district or destroy all or part of a historic site unless the Historic Preservation
Committee recommends and the Plan Commission approves such work and the building services
supervisor issues a permit to raze.
(2) Demolition Permit Application. Upon receipt of an application for a permit to demolish a historic
property, the Committee may recommend that the Plan Commission deny approval for a period of up
to 12 months, during which time the Committee and the applicant, in good faith, shall attempt to find
a means by which to save such property from demolition.
(3) Demolition Permit Issuance Procedure. If at the end of 12 months, no mutually agreeable method of
saving the property is underway, or no funds have been granted to preserve the property, the building
services supervisor may issue a demolition permit without the approval of the Plan Commission.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-145: Appeals
An appeal of any Plan Commission action relating to the regulation of construction, reconstruction or
exterior alteration or the regulation of demolition may be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the
grounds for such appeal, with the City Clerk prior to the date on which the Council is scheduled to approve
the Plan Commission action. The City Clerk shall file the petition to appeal with the Council and the Council
shall schedule a public hearing after which the Council may, by a favorable vote of 2/3 of its members,
reverse or modify the decision of the Plan Commission. In modifying or reversing a decision of the Plan
Commission, the Council shall find that owing to special conditions, the decision of the Plan Commission
would cause serious hardship to the property owner or preclude reasonable use of the property. Self-created
hardship or expectation of increased economic return shall not be the basis for modifying or reversing a
decision of the Plan Commission.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-146: Conditions Dangerous to Life, Health, or Property
Nothing contained in this article shall prohibit the making of necessary construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any historic structure, any improvement on a historic site or in a historic district

conditional use, after taking into consideration the applicant’s proposal and any requirements
recommended by the applicant to ameliorate such impacts.
(d) The Zoning Administrator shall prepare a written report addressing items (6)(c)1.-5. above, to be
forwarded to the Plan Commission for the Commission’s review and use in making its
recommendation to the Common Council. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the

Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
(7) Public Hearing. Within 50 days of filing of a complete application, the Plan Commission shall hold a
public hearing in compliance with Section 18-158 to consider the request.
(8) Review and Recommendation by the Plan Commission.

initial meeting or may continue the proceedings at applicant’s request. The Common Council
may approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may approve the proposed conditional
use with modifications, or may deny approval of the proposed conditional use.
(c) If the Common Council fails to make a decision within 90 days of the public hearing, the
application shall be considered approved, unless an extension is granted in writing by both
Applicant and the City.
(10) Effect of Denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted
for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or
proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.

must demonstrate that the proposed conditional use meets all general and specific conditional use
requirements in the site plan required for initiation of development activity on the subject property per
Section 18-164. Once a conditional use is granted, no erosion control permit, site plan, certificate of
occupancy, or building permit shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all
requirements of this Chapter. Any conditional use found not to be in compliance with the terms of
this Chapter shall be considered in violation of this Chapter and shall be subject to all applicable
procedures and penalties. A conditional use may be revoked for such a violation by majority vote of
the Common Council, following a public hearing and recommendation by the Plan Commission.
(12) Time Limits on the Development of Conditional Use. Unless extended as a condition of approval, the
start of construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval
by the Common Council and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate
development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. For
the purposes of this Section, “operational” shall be defined as the granting of a certificate of
occupancy for the conditional use. Prior to such a revocation, the applicant may request an extension
of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by the Common Council and shall be based
upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by the Common Council). However, as a
condition of approval, the 365 and/or 730 day time limits may be extended for any specific period
including not time limit to accommodate phased or multi-stage development.
(13) Discontinuing an Approved Conditional Use. Any and all conditional uses which have been
discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically.
The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject
conditional use was operational during this period.
(14) Change of Ownership. All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless
of ownership of the subject property; however, submittal of a plan of operation may be required prior
to the change in ownership.
(15) Amendments. Modification, alteration, or expansion or a previously approved conditional use shall
require a public hearing, review by Plan Commission, and approval by the Common Council unless
otherwise stated within the Chapter. The following are except from this requirements:
(a) A modification, alteration, or expansion which has been approved as part of a prior valid
condition use does not require a new conditional use approval.
(b) Minor amendments to the site plan, such as small additions to structures and parking areas that
are 1,200 square feet or less, new accessory structures that are 1,200 square feet or less, moving
the location of structures or parking areas a short distance and changes to the outdoor display
area, outdoor storage areas and uses, and landscape or lighting plans, may be approved
administratively, provided the conditions of the conditional use permit, regulations for design
and performance standards, and the bulk regulations for the underlying zoning district are met.
If the changes are determined to be significant or have the potential to adversely impact adjacent
properties, the Zoning Administrator may require the conditional use permit to be amended
following the procedures of Section 18-161.
(16) Recording of Conditional Use Requirements. Except for conditional use approvals for temporary uses,
a certified copy of the authorizing resolution, containing identifiable description and any specific
requirements of approval, shall be recorded by the City with the Register of Deeds for the subject
property.
(17) Formerly Approved Conditional Uses. A use which was approved as a conditional use, prior to the
effective date of this Chapter, shall be considered as a legal, conforming land use. Any modification of
the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall be reviewed under Section 18-161.

be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of
new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
(8) Limited Effect of a Variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has granted a variance, such
approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it any status as
a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting of a variance
shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as precedent for any
other proposed variance.
(9) Stay of Proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furthering
enforcement of any provisions of this Chapter from which the applicant is requesting a variance,
unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the request for the

determination in the report.
(5) Standards for Review. This Chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the
purposes intended by the Common Council as noted in this Chapter and the Comprehensive Plan.
The intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this Chapter is to protect both individual
property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed,
modified, or existing land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this Chapter shall proceed as
follows:
(a) Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation is
required. (Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit
discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning
regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the
general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential
negative impact. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful
analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood that there may
be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated.)
(b) Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design
and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. There is a
critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom
to achieve a permitted land use, and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously
permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the
degree specified in the Chapter. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the
standards of this Chapter is to be prohibited.
(c) Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of
the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person’s land use proposal. If an
interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one
expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to
any affected party (i.e. the abutting landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property
owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which
would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is
contrary to the spirit of this Chapter. Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase
the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall
be considered counter to the legislative intent of this Chapter. Any interpretation which will
result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be
made if the party interpreting this Chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or
requirements.
(d) This Chapter has been carefully designed by the Common Council to combine maximum
achievement of public goals, and the protection of abutting property owners while providing
flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Great care has been taken to balance the rights of
competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use
options. Persons interpreting this Chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the
legislative acts of the Common Council.
(e) In addition to the applicant’s response to the questions required by Subsection (d), above, the
following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use
interpretation matters:
1. No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously
considered and rejected by the Common Council on an application for an amendment to the
Zoning Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map, or a previously applied for appeal from a
requested interpretation.
2. No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right, a special use, or a
conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning
district of the subject property (see Article II).
3. No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented
which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to
development in the subject property’s zoning district (see Article II).
4. No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is
substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such
other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district, or permitted in a more intensive
district in the same zoning district category (see Article II).
5. If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in
the subject property’s district than to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation
permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to
Section 18-161.
(6) Effect of a Favorable Land Use Interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to be
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the
establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of
any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this Chapter. These
permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, required site plans, special use permits,
conditional uses, and certificates of occupancy.
(7) Limitations on Favorable Land Use Interpretation.
(a) No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a
specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of
issuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit is issued and development has begun
within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of
occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period.
(b) An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a
specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular
location for which the interpretation was issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to
authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A
favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the
particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365
consecutive days or more.
(ORD 1240, 11/13/12)
Section 18-170: Appeals of Zoning Interpretations
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which enable the City to hear and
decide requests for appeals from the interpretations of the Zoning Administrator per Section 18-152 as
provided for by Wisconsin Statutes 62.23(7)(e)(7).
(2) Initiation of Request for Appeal. Proceedings for the review of an appeal may be initiated by any
person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision
of the Zoning Administrator.
(3) Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken to the Zoning Board of
Appeals determines that, by reason of facts state in the certificate, a stay would cause immediate peril
to life or property. In such case, the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining
order which may be granted by the Board of Appeals or by a court of record on application and on
notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
(4) Time Limit for Filing an Appeal. Any appeal under the provisions of this Section shall be made per the
requirements of Subsection (d), below, within a period not exceeding 45 days from the date of issuance
of the interpretation by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to initiate this appeal procedure within this
45-day period shall constitute a final and binding waiver of the right to appeal said interpretation.
(5) Application Requirements. An application of an appeal of a zoning interpretation shall contain the
following (digital files should be submitted rather than paper copies whenever possible):
(a) A copy of pertinent items in the file on the matter at hand as identified by the Zoning
Administrator and/or the applicant.
(b) A written statement from the applicant indicating the reasons why an appeal is justified. This
statement shall be dated and signed by the applicant.
(6) Review by the Zoning Administrator.
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the
requirements of this Chapter. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant.
(b) The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written
justification for the requested appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals as submitted by the
applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall also evaluate the application to determine whether the
requested is in harmony with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan.
(c) The Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the Board of Appeals for review and action.
If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions
this Chapter or the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note this determination
in the report.
(7) Public Hearing. Within 45 days of filing of a complete application, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hold a public hearing in compliance with Section 18-158 to consider the request.
(8) Review and Action by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(a) Within 60 days after the filing of the complete application, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
make its findings. The Zoning Board of Appeals may request further information and/or
additional reports from the Zoning Administrator and/or the applicant. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may take final action on the application for appeal at the time of its initial meeting, or
may continue the proceedings at applicant’s request. Said final action shall be followed by a
written report which shall include a formal finding of facts developed and approved by the
Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the request.
(b) If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to make a determination within 60 days after the filing of
said complete application, then the request for the appeal shall be considered denied.
(9) Effects of Denial. No application for an appeal which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall
be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of
new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
(10) Limited Effect on a Favorable Ruling on an Appeal.
(a) No ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to be
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of
more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the ruling on the appeal, unless a building
permit is issued and development is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within
that period.
(b) A ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to be
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize
only that particular use at that particular location for which the ruling was issued. The ruling shall
not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate ruling has not been
issued. A favorable ruling shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the
particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365
consecutive days or more.

Article II. Administration
Sec. 19-31. Variances.
(1) For property within the City Limits where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may recommend variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
this chapter; and further provided that the plan commission shall not recommend variations or exceptions to
the regulations of this chapter unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that all three of the following criteria are met:
(e) Unnecessary Hardship. That an unnecessary hardship exists if the property owner shows that they
have no reasonable use of the property without a use variance or when compliance would unreasonably
prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with
such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome without an area variance;
(f) Unique Property Limitations. That the need for a variance is due to unique physical limitations of the
property, such as steep slopes or wetlands, that prevent compliance with the ordinance; and
(g) No Harm to Public Interests. That granting of the variance will not result in harm to the public
interests and will not materially impair the general purposes of this chapter as well as the general
purpose of a specific zoning provision.
(2) When in the judgment of the Plan Commission, or City Engineer for minor subdivision, it would be
inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter because the subdivision is located outside the
corporate limits within the extraterritorial plat review area, it may waive such provision or vary it in the
manner that would best serve the public interest.

Article III. Plat Approval
Sec. 19-61. Procedure
In planning and developing a subdivision within the city or the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction, the
subdivider or his agent shall in every case follow the procedure outlined below:
(1) Concept Plan Conference.
(a) Before submitting a preliminary plat or map, the developer may request a Concept Plan Conference
with appropriate City Staff that may include the Planning and Economic Development Department,
Department of Public Works, Engineering Division, Building Services Division, Marshfield Utilities,
the Marshfield Fire Department, and such other departments as determined by the Planning and
Economic Development Department.
(b) To request a Concept Plan Conference, the developer shall submit an application and Concept Plan for
the proposed subdivision five (5) days prior to the requested meeting date.
(2) Preliminary plat or map procedure. Before submitting a final plat or map for approval, the subdivider shall
prepare a preliminary plat or map. The preliminary plat or map shall be prepared in accordance with this
chapter and one (1) large 22" x 30" or larger copy along with an electronic copy in PDF format shall be
submitted to the Planning and Economic Development Department least twenty-five (25) days prior to the
meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired.
(a) Upon submittal of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall be responsible for forwarding the original
plat to the director in accordance with § 236.12(6)Wis. Stats.
(b) Public hearing & notification. Before taking action on a preliminary plat, the Plan Commission shall
hold a public hearing following the guidelines of at least a Class I notice. Notice of the proposed plat
and of the scheduled hearing shall be sent by regular mail at least ten (10) days before the date of such
hearing to the owners of record of all properties located within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of
the proposed plat.
(c) When the City determines to approve a plat within the City, it shall give at least 10 days' prior written
notice of its intention to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any
portion of such proposed plat but failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any such plat.
(d) Staff review. Prior to the public hearing, City staff shall review the preliminary plat for conformance
with the municipal code. The Development Review Team may review the preliminary plat and may
include the following departments: Planning and Economic Development Department, Department of
Public Works, Engineering Division, Building Services Division, Marshfield Utilities, and such other
departments as determined by the Planning and Economic Development Department.
(e) The Plan Commission shall within ninety (90) days of the filing of the plat or map approve, approve
conditionally or reject the plat or map, following review of the preliminary plat or map and other
materials submitted, for conformity with all ordinances, administrative rules and regulations. The plan
commission may negotiate with the subdivider regarding changes deemed advisable, and the kind and
extent of changes which will be required. Failure of the Plan Commission to act within the 90 days, or
extension thereof, constitutes an approval of the preliminary plat.
(f) The action of the Plan Commission shall be noted on two (2) copies of the preliminary plat or map;
one copy will be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon, and if approved
conditionally or rejected, the conditions or reasons therefore in writing. The second copy shall be filed

(g) Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the
final plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within thirty-six (36) months of preliminary plat
approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat layout as indicated in § 236.11(1)(b) Wis.
Stats. the final plat shall be entitled to approval with respect to such layout.
(3) Final plat or map procedure.
(a) The final plat or map, a written application for approval and such copies thereof as shall be required,
shall be submitted to the Planning and Economic Development Department within thirty-six (36)
months of approval of the preliminary plat or map and at least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting of
the Plan Commission at which action is desired. However, if approval of the plat or map must be
obtained from another approving authority subsequent to approval by the Plan Commission, the final
plat or map shall be submitted within thirty-six (36) months of such approval. The Plan Commission
may grant an extension within the thirty-six (36) month time period in either case.
(b) The Planning and Economic Development Department shall forward the final plat or map to the Plan
Commission for its recommendation. The Plan Commission shall refer the final plat or map to the

extended by agreement with the subdivider. When the City determines to approve a plat, it shall give at
least ten (10) days' prior written notice of its intention to the clerk of any municipality whose
boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of such proposed plat but failure to give such notice
shall not invalidate any such plat.

original plat to the director in accordance with § 236.12(6)Wis. Stats. The Council shall not act on a
plat after referral by the Plan Commission until the plat has been approved by the director. The Council
shall approve or reject the plat within sixty (60) days of submission of the plat, unless the time is
extended by agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in the minutes of the
Council meeting and a copy forwarded to the subdivider. The final plat may, if permitted by the Plan
Commission, constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider
proposes to record at the time of submittal, except that a final plat that is only a portion of an approved
preliminary plat may be submitted without the permission of the approving authority and is entitled to
approval if the preliminary plat identifies phases of the development and the portion of the final plat
being submitted substantially conforms to the preliminary plat or portion of the preliminary plat as
approved. If the City fails to act within sixty (60) days and the time has not been extended by
agreement and if no unsatisfied objections have been filed within that period, that plat shall be deemed
approved.
(d) Two (2) 22" x 30" true copies and a digital copy of the approved final plat or map in MicroStation
format or equal in Wisconsin's Wood County Coordinate System shall be filed with the City Clerk.
Such copies shall contain any changes or modifications as a result of action of the Plan Commission or
director. (Digital version shall be submitted in Wisconsin's Wood County Coordinate System and in a
format that can be precisely converted to MicroStation DGN format. This digital version shall be
supplied to the City Engineer.)
(e) The City Engineer shall determine if a final plat "substantially conforms" to the preliminary plat. This
determination shall be given to the Common Council along with a recommendation for approval/denial
of the final plat. The conclusion and recommendation are not required to be in writing, but shall be
made part of the public record at the proceeding which the final plat is being considered.

(3) Plans and specifications. At the option of the City the plans and specifications for any or all of the required
improvements may be prepared by the City. If the subdivider is required by the City to furnish plans and
specifications, they shall be prepared by a registered engineer and approved by the City Engineer and any
state agency having jurisdiction over such plans. In either case, the subdivider shall be responsible for the
cost of plan preparation and any surveys needed to prepare the plans.
(4) Construction. The City may undertake construction with City forces at the request of the subdivider of
improvements normally constructed by the City if the City's construction schedule permits. Such
construction shall be approved by the Board of Public Works and the subdivider shall deposit a bond or
cash with the City in the amount of the estimated cost of the work prior to the start of construction.
Payment in full shall be made to the City upon the completion of the work. The construction of any
improvements not undertaken by the City shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.
(5) Inspection. All construction shall be subject to inspection by the Department of Public Works. The cost of
inspection shall be charged to the subdivider. For sanitary sewer construction, final inspection required
shall include air pressure testing, mandrel testing, and televising. In the event City personnel are unable to
complete inspection services, an outside consultant or third party services may be necessary. Such
consultant services and all costs associated with these services shall be born by the subdivider. The
consultant utilized for such services shall be approved by the City Engineer and subdivider.
(6) Dedication required. All facilities and improvements installed prior to the final approval of the plat shall be
considered dedicated to the City (pending inspection and acceptance of said improvements), along with
streets and other public areas, upon approval of the plat. Facilities and improvements completed under bond
or other financial guarantee, after approval of the plat, shall be considered dedicated (pending inspection
and acceptance of said improvements) to the City upon their approval and acceptance and release of the
bond or other guarantee.
(7) Development Agreement. All subdivisions that require public improvements shall require a development
agreement before final plat approval. The agreement shall provide, among other things, the following:
(a) The number and location of the lots to be developed during any period of time involved, which order
of development shall be termed "stages" or "phases."
(b) A description of the periods of time within which all of such stages or phases shall be developed.
(c) The method of financing such improvements by one or more of the following:
(1) Special assessments under § 66.0703 Wis. Stats. and the number of annual installments for each
phase, if determinable.

(d) A provision detailing the means by which engineering services for the subdivision and/or public
improvements will be provided.
(e) A provision that all required improvements shall be installed in accordance with the laws and
regulations of the state, City ordinances and the standards for the installation of such facilities which
have been or may thereafter be adopted by the Board of Public Works. Standards for public facilities
(Street, Sidewalk, Storm Sewer, Sanitary Sewer, Watermain and Signage) are on record with the City
Engineer.
(f) A provision that the agreement and the terms thereof shall be recorded in the office of the register of
deeds for Wood or Marathon County, whichever is applicable, in order to give notice to any
subsequent purchasers of the property included in the subdivision or any phase thereof.
(g) A provision requiring a surety in favor of the City and in a form acceptable to the City Attorney to
secure performance of the development agreement. Said surety shall be in an amount equal to the
estimated cost of construction or other amount established by Common Council. If the subdivider's
project will be constructed in phases, the amount of any surety bond or other security required by the
City shall be limited to the phase of the project that is currently being constructed. The City may not
require that the subdivider provide any security for improvements sooner than is reasonably necessary
before the commencement of the installation of the improvements.
(h) A provision determining the time within which the installation of the required facilities shall
commence and be completed, so far as possible to ascertain.
(i) A provision, if requested by the developer and approved of by the City, that allows for an exception to
the sidewalk requirement in Sec. 19-63 (1) (e).
(j) Any other or additional provisions which may be deemed necessary by the City, or its appropriate
officials, in order to supplement the agreement and accomplish the end desired thereby, giving due
consideration to the needs of the subdivider and to the protection of the public.
(8) Exceptions. This section shall not apply to a situation involving a single lot of not more than 30,000 square
feet in area which is the subject of a certified survey map or plat if one side of the lot has access to an
existing, improved street and one side abuts on an unopened or undedicated street which is on the master
street plan as of the date of the application for a building permit, and if such lot does not exceed in length
along the unopened or undedicated street approximately the same length as any lot abutting on the other
side of such lot, or along the same street in the same block. As a condition of obtaining this exception,
however, the applicant for the building permit shall agree to provide, in the case of sale of such lot, a
covenant in the instrument of conveyance that the purchaser, or his successors in title, shall pay the costs of
installing the facilities otherwise required by this section, if such street is opened, and if requested to do so
by the Council, to the extent of 50 percent (50%) of such costs. In the event such street has not been
dedicated, a further condition shall be the dedication of a minimum of thirty (30) feet (or one-half of the
width of the street) as classified by the most current "City of Marshfield Comprehensive Plan", along the
entire length of the lot in question.

CD19:22
(l) Double-frontage shall be discouraged except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(m) Compliance with Comprehensive Plan and Ordinances. The arrangement, character, features, and
layout of land division in the City of Marshfield shall be designed to comply with the standards of this
chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, the Official Map, and/or any comprehensive utility plans or other
planning documents which may pertain to the standards of design for land divisions and which have
been adopted by the Common Council. Where no such planning documents have been adopted,
subdivisions shall be designed according to engineering and planning standards approved by the City
Engineer and applied so as to properly relate the proposed development with adjacent development,
the topography, natural features, public safety and convenience, and the most advantageous
development of undeveloped adjacent lands. In the absence of a street being shown on the official map,
streets shall be provided in locations determined necessary by the City Engineer and to the right-ofway
widths required in this Sec. 19-64 (1) g. for the classification of street required.

Article V. Park & Recreational Land Dedications
Sec. 19-80. Dedication of land for parks and recerational areas
(1) Purpose. This section is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of parks, playgrounds, trails,
recreation and open spaces as a function of subdivision and development in the City of Marshfield.
(2) Review. Upon the submission of a preliminary plat for a major subdivision, the zoning administrator shall
determine the dedication requirements and review them based on recommendations in the City's
Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan and request that this item be placed on
the Parks and Recreational Forestry Committee's subsequent meeting agenda. The Parks and Recreational
Forestry Committee shall review all park, playground, trail, recreation and open space dedications and
provide a recommendation to the Common Council based on the dedication requirements in Sec. 19-81.
(3) Dedication Requirement. In order that adequate open spaces and sites for public uses may be properly
located and reserved and in order that the cost of providing public areas, such as but not limited to, parks,
playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces may be equitably apportioned on the basis of additional
need created by residential development, each subdivider of a major subdivision for residential use shall be
required to dedicate land or fees in lieu of land for parks, recreation or open spaces.
(4) General Design. In the design of a major subdivision or planned unit development, provision shall be made
for suitable sites of adequate area for parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces. Such sites are
to be shown on the Preliminary Plat and Final Plat, and the following areas should be preserved when
feasible but shall not count towards the required parkland dedication: scenic and historic sites, stands of
trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie and
wetlands, and plant and animal communities.
(5) Site Reservations Required. Where the area proposed to be divided contains a park, playground, trail, or
other public area which is shown in the Comprehensive Plan or the Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation
Plan, such area shall either be dedicated to the proper public agency, or, at the Common Council's
determination, it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby within a three (3) year period by purchase or
other means if such lands meet or exceed dedication requirements. If the land is not acquired during this
period, it shall be released to the subdivider.
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 12-14-2010)
Sec. 19-81. Dedication requirements
(1) Dedication of Sites. When feasible and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive
Outdoor Recreation Plan, the subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide
for park, playground, trail, recreation and open space needs of the land development within the City of
Marshfield. The location of such land to be dedicated shall be determined by the Common Council. Where
the dedication is not compatible with the Comprehensive Plan and Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation
Plan, or for other reasons is not feasible as determined by the Common Council, the subdivider shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the City a fee as established by this Article, or a combination thereof.
(2) Dedication of Parks, Playgrounds, Trails, Recreation and Open Spaces. The subdivider shall dedicate
sufficient land area to provide adequate parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces to meet the
needs to be created by and to be provided for the land division, subdivision or comprehensive development.
The minimum dedication shall be one (1) acre for each forty-five (45) potential dwelling units or fractions
thereof.
MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD19:25
(3) Combination of Residential Uses. Where a combination of residential uses is intended, the minimum
dedication shall be the sum obtained by adding the potential residential units intended for single-family and
two-family dwellings, and the potential residential units intended for multifamily dwellings. Where a
definite commitment is made to the City by the developer with respect to those portions of the project
intended for single family, duplex and multi-family dwellings, the dedication shall be based upon the
maximum dedications which the zoning classification of the parcel will permit.
(4) Minimum Size of Park and Recreation Land Dedications.
a. In general, land reserved for parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces purposes shall have an
area of at least one (1) acre of contiguous land. Where the amount of land to be dedicated is less than
one (1) acre, the Common Council may require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on
the edge of the proposed major subdivision or planned unit development so that additional land may be
added at such time that the adjacent land is subdivided.
b. Land dedicated for the purpose of establishing trails shall be shown as an easement on the Preliminary
and Final Plats. The minimum width of the easement shall be no less than thirty (30) feet wide. Widths
greater than 30 feet may be required in certain circumstances as determined by the Plan Commission.
Neither end of the easement may result in a dead-end, unless a future connection has been identified or
may be reasonably established. Up to onehundred percent (100%) of the total land area of the granted
easement may be counted towards the overall dedication requirement.
c. Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and location suitable for use as a
playground, playfield or for other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively level and dry. A
recreation site shall have frontage on one or more streets for public access. The Common Council shall
make the final determination of suitability.
(5) Fees in Lieu of Land.
a. Where, the Common Council, determines there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed land
division or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the City's Comprehensive Plan or
Outdoor Recreation Plan, the minimum size under Section 19-81 (4) cannot be met, or City officials
determine that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the Common Council, shall
require the subdivider to contribute a park and recreation development fee in lieu of land. The fees
collected shall be held in a non-lapsing fund to be used for purchase, development, and improvement
of parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces. The total fee shall be computed on the basis
of the maximum residential use of each parcel permitted in the particular zoning district under the
Zoning Code. For each proposed residential development, the fee shall be $200.00 for each residential
unit. The fee shall be paid to the City at the time of final plat approval.
b. The Common Council may, permit the subdivider to satisfy the requirements of this Article by
combining a land dedication with a fee payment. If only a percent of the land dedication is made, the
subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to the required per unit fee in lieu of land. For
example, if a land dedication of twenty-five percent (25%) of the required dedication is made, the
subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to seventyfive percent (75%) of the required per unit
fee in lieu of land.
c. The City shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this Section in a separate account to
be used at the discretion of the Common Council in any City-owned park, for developing adequate
parks, playgrounds, trails, recreation and open spaces.
(6) Limitations. A subdivider shall not be required to dedicate more than one-fifth (1/5) of the total area of the
plat to meet the objectives of this Section.
SUBDIVISION AND PLATTING
CD19:26
(7) Suitability of Lands. Common Council shall have sole authority to determine the suitability and adequacy
of park lands proposed for dedication. Drainageways, wetlands or areas reserved for streets shall not be
considered as satisfying land dedication requirements.
(8) Access to Dedicated Land. All dedicated land shall have frontage on a public street and shall have public
access.
(9) Utility Extensions. The subdivider shall install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines
to the property line of all dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to the adjacent properties.
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 12-14-2010)
Sec. 19-82. When additional land is to be reserved
(1) When public parks and sites for other public areas as shown on the Comprehensive Plan lie within the
proposed area for development and are greater in area than required by Section 19-81 (4), the owner shall
reserve for acquisition by the City, through agreement, purchase or condemnation, the remaining greater
public area for a period of three (3) years of Final Plat approval unless extended by mutual agreement.
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 12-14-2010)
Sec. 19-83. Standards for dedicated lands
(1) When parklands are dedicated to the City, the subdivider is required to:
a. Properly grade and contour for proper drainage;
b. Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as approved by the City Engineer; and
c. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one (1) year following issuance of the first building permit
within that land division unless otherwise authorized by the City. The improved are shall not be
deemed officially accepted until a uniform grass cover to a two (2) inch height has been established. It
shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to maintain the area until the City accepts the dedication.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain the dedicated areas upon their dedication and
acceptance by the City.
(3) The Common Council may require certification of compliance with this Article by the subdivider. The cost
of such report shall be paid by the subdivider.
(4) If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this Section, the Common Council may contract said
completion and bill such costs to the subdivider, following a written notice to the subdivider of
noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate withholding of all building permits
until such costs are paid.
(5) The subdivider shall pay all costs of public improvements in the public streets adjacent to or within all
public and/or park lands.

Article I. In General
Sec. 20-01. Statutory authorization, findings of fact and statement of purpose.
(1) Statutory authorization. This chapter has been adopted pursuant to the authorization of §§ 62.23 and 62.231
Wis. Stats. and NR 117.01 et seq. Wis. Admin. Code.
(2) Findings of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shorelands-wetlands and pollution of the navigable
waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and
impair the tax base. The legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
(a) Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
(b) Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands;
(c) Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
(d) Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other
aquatic habitat;
(e) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
(f) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and
controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth-moving activities.

notice to. Furthermore, should the PEG Public Access Coordinator provide the Video Service
Provider or Cable Operator with a written response that the PEG channel was substantially utilized
during the time period in question or will be substantially utilized by the municipality, the Video
Service Provider or Cable Operator shall not disconnect, reprogram or drop the PEG channel or
channels.
4. Penalty for Failing to Provide Notice(s). If any Video Service Provider or Cable Operator
disconnects, reprograms or drops any PEG channels without providing the notice(s) as required in
subs.1. through 3., above, the Video Service Provider or Cable Operator shall be subject to the
following:
a. Immediate reinstatement of the PEG channel to its location in the channel line-up prior to the

produced programming" includes any program that was in part produced for original airing in the broadcast
MARSHFIELD CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE ORDINANCE
CD23:4
market in which it was produced either in part or in whole. The term "locally produced" shall not require
that the programming was created, filmed or produced in the Marshfield area. PEG stations may share and
exchange programming content in order to meet the substantial utilization requirements of Sec.
66.0420(5)(b), Wis. Stats.
(7) Underwriting of Programming. PEG channels may transmit non-commercial programming to subscribers
generally or to specific recipients of Video Service Providers or Cable Operators. Nothing herein shall in
any way prohibit or prevent PEG channels from accepting grants or sponsorships in support of such
programming nor shall PEG channels be prohibited from acknowledging such grants or sponsorships
before, during or immediately after such PEG programming has been broadcast in such a manner that is
similar to the manner in which the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) acknowledges the substantially
similar support of its programming content. Such acknowledgments shall comply with the requirements of
47 USC §399b as though the PEG channel were a public broadcast station. (8) Notice of Intention to Move
PEG Channel Locations/Designations. Any Video Service Provider or Cable Operator, who intends to
move any PEG channel from the channel designations in effect at the time that this ordinance is enacted,
may only make such a change after providing 60 days advance written notice to the affected PEG
channel(s). Additionally, such Video Service Provider or Cable Operator shall engage in a public education
program of such intensity and duration as to reasonably inform the general public of the proposed PEG

Section 24-01: Purpose
(1.) The purpose of this Chapter is to establish standards for the fabrication, erection, and use of signs, and to
regulate the location, type, size, and height of signage for all properties within the City of Marshfield. The
adoption of this Chapter reflects the formal finding of fact by the City of Marshfield Plan Commission
and Common Council that regulation of signage advances the following compelling governmental
interests:
(a) Promote the public welfare, health, and safety of all persons using public thoroughfares and right-ofways
within the City of Marshfield in relation to the signage displayed thereon, or overhanging, or
projecting into such public spaces.
(b) Advance the aesthetic goals of the City throughout the community, and to ensure the effectiveness
and flexibility in the design, creativity, or use of signage without creating a detriment to the general
public.
(c) Reduce signage which the City has determined is a cause of unsafe traffic and visibility conditions.
(2.) Furthermore, this regulation leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech
communication for the messages portrayed on such advertising signs – namely, distributed print media,
broadcast media, and point-of-purchase display, and is narrowly defined so as to limit said prohibition to
commercial speech on exterior signage.
(3.) The penalties of the City of Marshfield Municipal Code in Chapter 1 Section 1-05 may be applicable to
violations of the provisions of this Chapter.

Section 24-03: Permitted Sign Regulations and Allowable Districts
Zoning Districts and Uses. The following table will be used to describe and group certain zoning districts and
uses for permitted permanent signs in this chapter. Some districts and uses have size limitations. When
individual districts/uses are called out specifically in the regulations, the regulations for the broader category
for that group do not apply for that particular sign. Example: Post and panel signs in Residential Districts are
limited to 10 square feet in area, but Multifamily Residential Uses allows 24 square feet in area, the
Multifamily Residential Uses are still permitted to have 24 square feet of sign area for post and panel signs.
Where specific regulations such as setback, area, and height do not list districts or uses individually, said
regulations apply to all districts and uses where the sign is permitted. A sign or provision of a sign (such as
illumination) is prohibited in a district or use unless specifically permitted in the regulations listed in this
section. All illuminated signs must adhere to Section 24-12(11).

Section 24-04: Sign Area Allowance, Measurement Standards, and Flexible Criteria
(1.) Total Sign Area Allowance.
(a) Except for the Downtown Design Corridor, all signage for each lot is limited to 2 square feet per
linear foot of street frontage. Lots fronting on two or more public streets or alleys are allowed the
permitted sign area for each frontage; however, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular
street may not exceed the portion of the lot’s total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot,
building or wall area frontage on that street.
(b) Sign allowance in the Downtown Design Corridor is limited 25% of the façade of the building facing
a public street or up to 10% of the building façade facing a public alley or customer parking lot that
does not face a public street.
(2.) Measurement of Signs.
(a) Measurement of Sign Setback: The setback is measured from the right-of-way line or property line to
the leading edge of the sign or base, whichever is closer. The sign structure includes any part of
actual sign and the base the sign is built upon.
(b) Measurement of Sign Area: The measurement of sign area is based on the arrangement of sign copy
and sign background:
1. For signs comprised of individual letters either on a neutral surface or individual panels, sign
area shall be measured as the sum of the smallest rectangle enclosing each letter or related
copy. Neutral surface may include a painted sign band or other similar painted surfaces not
to be included in the total sign area.
2. For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a
background surface with one or more non-neutral background colors, sign area shall be
measured as the sum of the smallest rectangles and right triangles, including curved edges
(circles/ellipses), enclosing entire sign message and any and all non-neutral background color
areas.
3. For double-faced sign with faces at 60 degrees or less. Unless otherwise specified in these
regulations, when the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the angle formed by
the sign faces is 60 degrees or less, only one sign face shall be measured in computing the
sign area. If the two faces of such a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the larger sign
face shall be considered the area of the sign. Signs where the separation is larger than 60
degrees shall be counted as two separate signs.
4. For signs comprised of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of
objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their
maximum projection upon a vertical plane.
5. In the case of a freestanding sign (including three-dimensional objects), sign area shall
include the total sign areas per subsection 1-4 above, that can be viewed from any single
vantage point (i.e., for a typical freestanding sign which faces two directions, only one face of
the sign shall comprise the sign area). Sign area shall not include any elements of the sign
structure designed solely for support of the sign structure and located below or to the side of
the sign message. Examples of parts of a freestanding sign structure which are exempt from
the sign area include the sign base and the supporting columns, posts, or poles. Support
structures that include commercial messaging or logos may be counted towards the sign area
of the sign.
(c) Measurement of Sign Height: The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the natural
grade, at the center of base to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Grading or
landscape area less than 18 inches above the natural grade will not be counted toward the overall sign
height.
(3.) Flexible Criteria.
(a) If the business or development qualifies as a large building, which is defined as any building
exceeding 125 feet in length or having three or more stories or have gross square footage in excess of
50,000 square feet, the business or development will be allowed additional wall sign area per building
elevation up to an additional 150 square feet above the 200 square foot limitation, but may not
exceed 10% of the façade the sign is located on.
(b) If the building has an additional set-back it may be allowed additional wall sign area. The amount of
wall signage may be increased by one foot for every additional three feet the building is setback
beyond the required setback for the underlying zoning district (not using major street setback and
not permitted where zoning district has a zero foot front yard setback). The measurement shall be
taken from the closest point on the wall in which the sign is located to the nearest facing right-of-way
line. The development will be allowed additional sign area up to an additional 50 square feet of wall
signage above the 200 square foot limitation, but may not exceed 10% of the façade the sign is
located on. Example: Building setback 50 feet from the front property line in the CMU District.
CMU District requires a minimum 20 feet front setback. = (50-20) = 30/3 = 10 additional square
feet of sign allowance for the site.
(c) Flexibility: The City shall allow the following flexibility for freestanding signage where the setback is
increased for Mixed Use Districts, Institutional Uses, and Industrial Districts.
1. Height of Freestanding Sign. A sign may exceed the height requirements in Section 24-03 if
for every additional foot of height, the setback increased 2 foot up to a maximum of 4
additional feet per sign type.
2. Area of Freestanding Sign: A sign may exceed the area requirements in Section 24-03 if for
every additional 5 square feet of area, the setback increased 1 foot up to an additional 20
square feet per sign type.

3. All property lines and buildings on the property and within 50 feet of the proposed sign.
4. Required vision triangles per Chapter 18 of the City of Marshfield Municipal Code.
5. All parking areas, driveways, and public roads.
6. Method of attachment, structural support, method of illumination, and sign materials.
7. Approximate value of the sign to be installed, including cost of installation.
(d) In addition to the sign permit, an electrical permit may be required where applicable.
(e) Any other information that may reasonably be requested by the Zoning Administrator for the
purpose of application evaluation.
(f) Any existing or proposed sign on property abutting a State Highway, United States Highway, or
Interstate Highway may also require approval from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation or
the Federal Highway Administration.
(4.) Granting and Issuance.
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall review the application to ensure it is complete per the requirements
of Section 24-09(3), above.
(b) In cases where no other review or approvals are required under this Chapter, the Zoning

(CODE 1254, 11-12-2013)
Section 24-10: Master Sign Plan
(1.) Purpose. A master sign plan shall be used to establish criteria for and govern the construction of all signs
associated with a use for which a master sign plan has been approved. A permit will be required for
individual signs following or in conjunction with master sign plan approval. Signs constructed in violation
of an approved master sign plan shall be considered in violation of this sign code. Existing master sign
plans effective as of the date of this chapter may continue to be in effect if exceptions to the previous
sign code have been granted.
(2.) Applicability. A master sign plan shall be required in the following circumstances:
(a) Two or more signs are installed that do not meet all of the individual sign standards;
(b) Two or more signs are proposed for a Campus District or nonresidential Group or Large
Development;
(c) Signs in a Campus District or Group or Large Development that exceeds 50 square feet in area;
(d) An amendment to an existing master sign plan is being proposed when the proposed signage does
not comply with the existing master sign plan or the individual sign standards currently in place,
whichever is less restrictive;
(e) The Zoning Administrator determines that a master sign plan is needed because of project
characteristics such as:
1. Size and number of proposed signs,
2. Limited site visibility, or
3. Site location relative to major transportation routes.
(3.) Submission requirements. An application for master sign plan approval shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator and shall meet the requirements in Section 24-09(3).
(4.) Procedures. A master sign plan shall be review by the Zoning Administrator and approved by the Plan
Commission.
(5.) Flexible criteria. Refer to Section 24-04(3).
(6.) Amendment. A master sign plan may be amended by filing a new master sign plan for approval in
conformance with the requirements of the sign code in effect at that time to be approved by the Plan
Commission.
(7.) Binding effect.
(a) After approval of a master sign plan, no permanent sign shall be erected, placed, painted or
maintained by the property owner or any buyer, tenant, subtenant, assignee, employee, agent or other
party in use of the subject property except in conformance with such master sign plan without
obtaining a sign permit pursuant to Section 24-09.
(b) If the Plan Commission has approved a master sign plan with exceptions pursuant to Section 24-11,
the Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve, through the standard sign permit approval
process, sign applications in conformance with the master sign plan, which applications may conflict
with the terms of this sign code, but only to the extent that the application is in conformance with
the master sign plan.
(c) A master sign plan shall be enforced in the same manner as any other provision of this sign code.
(8.) Requirements.
(a) The master sign plan may be included in the application for final approval of any development plan,
site plan, planned unit development, office/business/industrial park development (multi-part
approvals) or building permit application for approvals issued by the City of Marshfield.
(CODE 1264, 11-12-2013)
Section 24-11: Alternative Signs
(1.) Alternative Sign Permits are appropriate for sign applications that seek approval for proposed signage
that is not completely described by the terms of this sign code or not fully in compliance with the specific
provisions of the Code. Alternative sign permits are reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and approved
by the Marshfield Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall use the criteria below to determine
whether to approve the Alternative Sign Permit.
(a) If the sign is not in full compliance with the definition or the type of sign is not permitted within a
given district, the Plan Commission may make considerations for unique signs that match or have
similar architectural styles or materials as the principal building(s).
(b) Site difficulties. If there are unusual site factors, which preclude an allowed sign from being visible to
the street immediately in front of the site, an adjustment may be granted to achieve visibility
standards. This adjustment is not intended to be used to make signs visible to other streets, but to
address site difficulties of visibility to the street on which the sign has direct frontage. Site difficulties
may include the sign face being blocked due to topography of the site, elevation of street, setback of
the existing development, existing development or landscaping on the site, or from abutting
development or landscaping. This set of adjustment criteria is generally intended to allow greater
flexibility in placement and dimension requirements of the sign. The adjustment may be approved if
the following criteria are found to be met:
1. There is no reasonable place on the site for an allowed sign without an adjustment to achieve
visibility standards to the street immediately in front of the site.
2. If the proposed sign extends into the five-foot setback requirement, the sign will not create a
traffic or safety hazard.
3. Of potential adjustments to meet the visibility standard, the request is the most consistent
with the surrounding development and sign patterns.
4. The adjustment is the minimum needed for a sign to meet the visibility standards.
5. Additional signage may not constitute an over proliferation of signs on a property or cause
needless repetition or redundancy of signage.
6. The sign would not be located so as to have a negative impact on adjacent property.
7. The size and height adjustment is the minimal to adhere visibility standards.
(c) If a proposed sign structure, including required landscaped areas would take up required parking
spaces and is unable to be suitably placed where setbacks can be met and required parking is not
removed, the Plan Commission may reduce or waive the setbacks and landscaping requirement.
(d) Signs where an alternative sign permit is specifically required elsewhere in this chapter such as an offpremises,
multiple freestanding signs on one lot, marquee, mural, or temporary sign, may not need to
meet all of the above criteria for approval. These are unique signs and the Plan Commission may
grant approval on a case by case basis.
(e) Zoning Administrator may require an alternative sign permit when provisions of the sign code are
unclear or contradicting. Standard sign permit fee applies.
(CODE 1254, 11-12-2013)
Section 24-12: Appearance, Construction and Maintenance of Signage
(1.) All signs shall be constructed, mounted, and maintained so as to comply with the appropriate detailed
provisions of the building code as adopted by the city relating to the design, structural members and
connections.
(2.) Electrical signs and sign installers shall also comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter 17,
Electrical Code as adopted by the city.
(3.) Illuminated signs must adhere to Section 24-12(11) and all electrical signs must be UL Listed.
(4.) Signs shall be mounted so that the method of installation is concealed. Signs applied to masonry surfaces
should be mechanically fastened to mortar joints only and not directly into brick or stone. Drilling to
provide electrical service shall follow the same rule.
(5.) No sign (except flags) shall be suspended by chains or other devices that will allow the sign to swing due
to wind action. Signs shall be anchored to minimize any lateral movement that would cause wear on the
sign face or supporting members or connections.
(6.) All permanent signs and their supporting members shall be constructed of standardized sign materials.
(7.) Sign materials should be compatible with the design of the face of the facade where they are placed and
should contribute to the legibility of the sign.
(8.) No combustible materials other than approved plastics shall be used in the construction of electric signs.
(9.) All signage within the jurisdiction of this Chapter shall remain in a state of proper maintenance. Proper
maintenance shall be the absence of loose materials (including peeling paint, paper or other material), the
lack of excessive rust, the lack of excessive vibration or shaking, and the presence of the original
structural integrity of the sign, its frame and other supports, its mounting, and all components thereof.
(10.) The repainting, changing of parts, and preventive maintenance of signs which completely conform to
the requirements of this Chapter, and result in no change in the overall appearance of the sign from that
originally approved, shall not be deemed alterations requiring a sign permit.
(11.) Illumination of any sign shall follow the requirements below:
(a) Flashing, flickering and/or other lighting which may distract motorists are prohibited.
(b) Intensity of Illumination.
1. Electrical signs shall also comply with the applicable provisions of the electrical code as
adopted by the city and must be UL Listed.
2. Illumination shall be designed to eliminate negative impacts on surrounding rights-of-way
and properties. The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness
that will create a negative impact on residential uses in direct line-of-sight to the sign.
3. Signs may not be illuminated in a manner that interferes with (including glaring or blinding),
misleads or confuses traffic.
4. External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of any object
other than the sign.
5. In no instance shall the amount of illumination attributable to any non-electronic message
center sign, as measured a distance of 10 inches from the face, exceed 60 foot-candles above
ambient lighting conditions. In no case, with all lighting components energized, shall the
lighting intensity of any sign, whether resulting from internal or external illumination, exceed
60 foot candles when measured with a standard light meter held at a distance of ten inches
from the sign face.
6. All electronic message center signs shall not exceed 0.3 footcandles above ambient light
conditions measured from a distance based on the area of the sign [measurement distance = v
(Area of Sign Sq. Ft. x 100)], perpendicular to the sign face, and using an illuminance meter
capable of accuracy of two decimals. Example: A 24 square foot electronic message center
would be limited to 0.3 footcandles when measured at a distance of 49 feet. Measurement
Distance = v(24*100) =49 feet.
7. All electronic message center signs shall be equipped with photosensitive equipment which
automatically adjusts the brightness and contrast of the sign in direct relation to the ambient
outdoor illumination.
8. All digital billboards signs must abide by Wisconsin State Statutes 84.30(4)(b)&(bm).
(12.) Any signs which may be, or may hereafter become rotted, unsafe, or in a state which is not properly
maintained shall be repaired or removed by the licensee or owner of the sign, or owner of the property
upon which the sign stands upon notice of the Zoning Administrator.
(13.) When a sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles and other structural elements (both surface and
subsurface) that supported the sign shall also be removed and the site restored. Affected building
surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of the structure and any electrical service is
safely removed or protected.
(14.) If the Zoning Administrator or the Building Inspector finds that any sign, awning, banner, billboard, flag
or any part of any such sign or derivative thereof is unsafe, insecure, dilapidated, out of repair or
abandoned, or is in such poor condition that it is dangerous or a blighting influence upon the
neighboring properties, they shall issue written notice to the owner of the property upon which the sign
exists to cause the sign to be repaired or removed in its entirety.
(15.) A sign shall not stand with bent, broken or missing sign faces, with broken supports, with loosed
appendages or struts.
(16.) A sign and the ground surrounding it shall be neat, clean and presentable.
(17.) An internally illuminated sign may only be allowed to stand with partial illumination for a period of no
more than 30 consecutive days, without justification.
(18.) Landscaping. When required as part of the sign allowances in Section 24-03, for all new sign structures
where a new base is installed, a landscaped area shall extend from the sign base a minimum of three feet,
be protected from vehicular encroachment, and be landscaped with a combination of low-growing
shrubs, landscape rocks, or ground cover. The landscaped treatment shall be designed and maintained
not to obstruct visibility of the sign message. A reduction to the landscaping requirement may be
approved administratively if the required landscape area would encroach into the right-of-way,
building/structure, existing improved parking area, or into a required parking stall.
(19.) Any existing or proposed sign on property abutting a State Highway, United States Highway, or
Interstate Highway may also require approval from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation or the
Federal Highway Administration.
(20.) All sign installers must meet the requirements of Section 17-38(4) of the City of Marshfield Electrical
Code.
(21.) In addition to the sign permit, an electrical permit may be required where applicable.
(CODE 1264, 11-12-2013)
Section 24-13: Enforcement of Sign Code
(1.) Enforcement of Sign Code and Revocation of Sign Permit.
(a) Any sign or regulation not specified in this chapter may be determined by reasonable interpretation
of the sign code by the Zoning Administrator.
(b) A sign permit may be revoked if the applicant has failed to comply with the provisions of this
Chapter or any conditions that may have accompanied the permit at the time of issuance. Revocation
shall be effective upon written notice by the Zoning Administrator for zoning ordinance violations.
(c) In the event that construction, installation, or manufacture of a sign for which a permit has been
issued has not commenced within 180 days from the date of the issuance of such permit, or if work
authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 90 days any time after the work
is commenced, the Zoning Administrator may revoke the original permit. In such cases, a new
permit shall be obtained to complete the work and a new permit fee shall be required.
(d) Any sign subject to a revoked permit shall be removed by the licensee, sign owner, or property owner
within 60 days of the revocation notice.
(e) Failure to comply within the timeframe of the revocation notice may result in issuance of citations
per Chapter 1 Section 1-05 of the City of Marshfield Municipal Code.
(f) Revocation shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.
(g) Any sign on public property or within the public right-of-way must be approved by the Director of
Public Works or the Board of Public Works.
(2.) Appeals. Any person affected by a decision of the Zoning Administrator may petition for a hearing
before the Plan Commission. The filing of such petition automatically stays removal of any nontemporary
sign which is the subject of the appeal and which has been legally erected until the Plan
Commission decides whether to sustain, modify, or reverse the decision of the Zoning Administrator.
(3.) Removal of Signs in Violation of this Chapter.
(a) If the Zoning Administrator determines that any sign exists in violation of this Chapter, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the sign permit holder or the owner of the property on which the sign is
located. Said notification shall indicate that such violation must be corrected within 60 days of receipt
of said notice on penalty of automatic revocation of any sign permit, and that removal of the sign by
the City may occur at the expense of the owner of the property.
(b) If notification is sent and the violation is not corrected within 60 days, the Zoning Administrator
may revoke the permit for any sign which is in violation of this Chapter or approve a reasonable
extension if the sign permit holder is unable to remove the sign within the required time. If sign is
not removed after the extension, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to cause removal of
such sign and may result in issuance of citations per Chapter 1 Section 1-05 of the City of Marshfield
Municipal Code.
(c) The expense of removing such sign shall be charged to the owner of the property on which the sign
is located. If the owner fails to pay such expense within one month of being billed therefore, or has
not made arrangement for payment satisfactory to the City Attorney, then such expense shall become
a lien on the property and shall be placed upon the tax roll.
(d) Any sign illegally placed in a public right-of-way may be subject to immediate removal and
confiscation without notice by the Zoning Administrator.
(e) Any temporary sign in violation of this chapter shall be notified of said violation by the Zoning
Administrator. Said notification shall indicate that such violation must be corrected within a given
timeframe. If not corrected by the required timeframe, removal of the sign by the City may occur at
the expense of the owner of the property, and failure to comply may result in issuance of citations
per Chapter 1 Section 1-05 of the City of Marshfield Municipal Code.
(f) In the case of violations of this sign code that constitute an emergency situation as a result of safety
or public concerns or violations that will create increased problems or costs if not corrected
immediately, may be subject to immediate removal and confiscation without notice by the Zoning
Administrator.
(4.) Vacant signs, buildings, structures or premises shall have the following effect:
(a) A sign is considered vacant after 90 days of a business being out of operation. After 90 days the
owner of the property shall be responsible for properly removing any commercial sign, or blanking
the commercial image associated with the business if the sign and structure is structurally sound, in
good condition, and on private property. If any portion of a vacant freestanding sign falls within the
public right-of-way, or the sign is structurally unsound, falling apart, or in poor condition, the Zoning
Administrator may take steps to have the sign removed under Section 24-13(3).
(b) Signs addressing the sale or leasing of the facility in compliance with Section 24-06 are permitted;
however, conversion of an existing sign or sign structure to a sale or leasing sign, where permitted,
shall not affect the time provisions of this section. In addition, the owner may be responsible for
restoring the facade of the building, structure or premises to its normal appearance.
(5.) Amendments to the Municipal Sign Code. The municipal sign code may be amended if errors or
inconsistencies are found or if updates need to be made to accommodate the desires of the community.
Amendments to the sign code require a Class 2 notice with a public hearing held before the Plan
Commission. Any amendments to the sign code must be approved by the Common Council through the
passage of an ordinance.
(CODE 1264, 11-12-2013)
Section 24-14. Fee schedule.
(1.) Fees shall be as stated in the City of Marshfield Fee Schedule, as established by the Common Council and
shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk.

performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity or
original purpose of the facility.
(c) Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in paragraph (a), this ordinance
applies to construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the Director of Public
Works or his designee, are likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the
existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water, that causes undue channel erosion,
that increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or
that endangers property or public safety.
(2) JURISDICTION.
This ordinance applies to land disturbing construction activity on construction sites

(2) The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers
of the same governing body.
(3) The Common Council hereby designates the Director of Public Works or his designee to
administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(4) The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent storm water management
requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals
including those authorized under ss. 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
(b) Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
(ORD 1279, 5/13/14)
Sec. 25-22. Findings of Fact.
The Common Council finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact
upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and
diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled postconstruction
runoff can:
(1) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed
scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream
temperature.
(2) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and
water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy
metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
(3) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant
loads.
(4) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
(5) Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,
drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities.
(6) Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks
and volumes.
(7) Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
(ORD 1279, 5/13/14)
Sec. 25-23. Purpose and Intent.
(1) PURPOSE. The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish long-term, postconstruction
runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health,
safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to:
(a) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
(b) Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and control soil erosion;
prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control
building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic
beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving
water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and
transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream
property.
(2) INTENT. It is the intent of the City of Marshfield that this ordinance regulates postconstruction
storm water discharges to waters of the state. This ordinance may be applied on a
site-by-site basis. The City of Marshfield recognizes, however, that the preferred method of
achieving the storm water performance standards set forth in this ordinance is through the
preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level storm water management plans
that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans
may prescribe regional storm water devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed
to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such
plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under s. 281.16, Wis. Stats.,
for regional storm water management measures and have been approved by the Common
Council, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction
management measures acceptable for the community.

contracted or obligated by other agreement with the landowner to implement and maintain postconstruction
storm water BMPs is the responsible party and shall comply with this ordinance.
(2) PLAN. A written storm water management plan in accordance with Sec. 25-29 shall be
developed and implemented for each post-construction site.
(3) REQUIREMENTS. The plan required under sub. (2) shall include the following:
(a) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to
control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site as follows:
1. BMPs shall be designed in accordance with Table 1., or to the maximum extent
practicable as provided in sub. (3). The design shall be based on an average annual
rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls.

2. MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE. If the design cannot meet a total
suspended solids reduction performance standard of Table 1., the storm water
management plan shall include a written, site-specific explanation of why the total
suspended solids reduction performance standard cannot be met and why the total
suspended solids load will be reduced only to the maximum extent practicable. No
person shall be required to exceed the applicable total suspended solids reduction
performance standard to meet the requirements of maximum extent practicable.
3. OFF-SITE DRAINAGE. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP
from off-site shall be taken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of
the practice. Any impact on the efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing
the size of the BMP accordingly.

designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more
than 1 percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective infiltration
area.
c. High imperviousness. For development with more than 80 percent connected
imperviousness, such as commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and
commercial downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 60 percent of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However,
when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no
more than 2 percent of the post-construction site is required as an effective
infiltration area.

use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this
section.
6. Groundwater Standards.
a. Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the
extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of
pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the
preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with

with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may
not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum
extent practicable.
b. Notwithstanding par. a., the discharge from BMPs shall remain below
the enforcement standard at the point of standards application.
7. Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for
parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial,
industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The
pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging
prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality in accordance
with sub. 6. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil and
grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips.
8. Maximum Extent Practicable. Where the conditions of subs. 3. and 4. limit or
restrict the use of infiltration practices, the performance standard of s. NR

delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths,
as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland
boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, “protective
area’ does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a
pipe or culvert, so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location.
a. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet.
b. For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a U.S. Geological
Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map,

coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood swamps,
and ephemeral ponds.
f. For less susceptible wetlands, 10 percent of the average wetland width, but
no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include:
degraded wetland dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill material
disposal sites that take on the attributes of a wetland.

to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff
susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in s.
NR 103.03.
h. Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with current
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources procedures. This paragraph does
not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in compliance with all
applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that

adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall
be established and maintained where no impervious surface is present. The
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide
for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat, and filtering of pollutants from
upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative
materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to
prevent erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
c. Best management practice such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention
ponds, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources, may be
located in the protective area.

swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant removal are exempt from the
requirements of local ordinance requirements for peak flow control, total
suspended solids control, and infiltration, if the swales are designed to do all of
the following or to the maximum extent practicable:
a. Swales shall be vegetated. However, where appropriate, non-vegetative
measures may be employed to prevent erosion or provide for runoff treatment,
such as rock riprap stabilization or check dams.

consistent with water quality standards, require that other requirements, in
addition to swale treatment, be met on a transportation facility with an average
daily traffic rate greater than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of the
state that the runoff directly enters is an of the following:
i. An outstanding resource water.
ii. An exceptional resource water.
iii. Waters listed in section 303 (d) of the Federal Clean Water Act that are

and maintenance.
(h) Where a regional treatment option exists such that the Director of Public Works or his
designee exempts the applicant from all or part of the minimum on-site storm water
management requirements, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount
determined in negotiation with the Director of Public Works or his designee. In
determining the fee for post-construction runoff, the Director of Public Works or his
designee shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost for land, engineering design,
construction, and maintenance of the regional treatment option.
(6) ALTERNATE REQUIREMENTS. The Director of Public Works or his designee may
establish storm water management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this
section if the Director of Public Works or his designee determines that an added level of
protection is needed to protect sensitive resources.
(7) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT: For redevelopment sites where the redevelopment will
be replacing older development that was subject to post-construction performance standards of

FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE
CD26:2
Article I. In General
Sec. 26-01. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose, and Title
(1) Statutory Authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in ss. 62.23, for cities; and
the requirements in s. 87.30, Stats.
(2) Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would
impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
(3) Statement of Purpose. This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(d) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(g) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(h) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between
property owners; and
(i) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use
or structure outside of the floodplain.
(4) Title. This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Marshfield,
Wisconsin.
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-12-2010)
Sec. 26-02. General Provisions
(1) Areas to be regulated. This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or
base flood.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional
flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as AZones
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(2) Official Maps & Revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or AZones
on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Marshfield Floodplain Appendix. Any
change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No
changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non- FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR. These maps and revisions are on filens are on file in the office of the Planning and Economic
MARSHFIELD MUNICIPAL CODE
CD26:3
Development Department, City of Marshfield. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps: Based on the FIS:
(a) Wood County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55141C0040G, 55141C0045G,
55141C0065G, dated February 17, 2010; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated February 17, 2010, volume 55141CV000A;
(b) Marathon County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55073C0780F, 55073C0785F,
55073C0795F, dated July 22, 2010; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) dated July 22, 2010, volume 55073CV000A;
(3) Establishment of Districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain
adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the
floodway.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater
during the regional flood.
(4) Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map
and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If a significant
difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Sec. 26-10. The zoning administrator can rely on
a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment
field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for
initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and
an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Sec. 26-09 (7) (c) and the criteria in
(a) and (b) below.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary.
The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale,
visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must
also approve any map amendment pursuant to Sec. 26-10 (1) (f).
(5) Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds
for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Sec. 26-
10.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The
property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(6) Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance
with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(7) Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages,
towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State
FLOODPLAIN ORDINANCE
CD26:4
agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction,
maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is
exempt when s.30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under s.62.23
for cities; or s.87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than
this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater
restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or
easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum
requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any
other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116,
Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date
of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
ordinance.
(10)Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on
engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain
areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance
create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
(12)Annexed areas for cities. The Wood County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch.NR116, Wis. Adm.
Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the
municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for
the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator.
All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
(13)General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone
area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods
and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals
(including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any
development that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance.
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-12-2010; Ord. No. 1180, § 1, 6-8-2010)

1. Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or
with other development, increasing regional flood height; or
2. Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01
foot.
(b) The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct
flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or
other adopted map, unless the provisions of sub. (c) are met.
(c) Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are
made to this ordinance, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles,
in accordance with Sec. 26-10.
Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown on the officially adopted
FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR.
(2) Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall

programs that have been certified either by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary
of the Interior; or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
Increase in regional flood height means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, equal to or
greater than 0.01 foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly
attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such
as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge.
Land use means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (Also see
DEVELOPMENT.)
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
The term "manufactured home" includes a mobile home but does not include a "mobile recreational vehicle."
