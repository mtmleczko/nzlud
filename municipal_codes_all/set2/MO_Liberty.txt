PREFACE 
    This volume, as originally published, constituted the first revision and codification of the general ordinances of the City of Liberty, Missouri, since 1931. It contained the Charter and such of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature passed on or before December 31, 1963, as were found desirable for retention, except those expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The Code, as now supplemented, contains ordinances up to and including the ordinance indicated on the page of instructions for handling supplemental pages. 
    The ordinances were codified, edited and indexed by the Editorial Staff of Michie City Publications Company under the supervision of Chas. W. Sublett, Stephen C. Willard and M. Paul Cook. 
    The publishers wish to express their appreciation for the cooperation of all the city officials and employees during the preparation of this publication. Particular acknowledgment is due the Honorable Wesley M. Smith, Mayor, Mr. Gary C. Clifton, City Attorney, and Mr. Charles S. Anderson, City Administrator, for their assistance during the progress of the work. 
    A feature to which the attention of the user is directed is the arrangement of the chapters in alphabetical order. Attention is also directed to the analysis preceding each chapter which, in many instances, will serve as an index within itself. The general index, carried at the end of the Code, has been carefully prepared and should serve as an accurate medium for locating the individual sections of law within the Code. In the footnotes appearing throughout the Code will be found references to the Charter and the applicable state law. These notes also contain cross references to other and related provisions in the City Code. By reference to the historical citations, appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to ascertain the ordinance from which the present section has been derived. 
    It is a recognized fact that if any Code is to accomplish its intended purpose it must be kept up to date by means of an adequate supplemental service. Accordingly, the publishers point out the advisability and necessity of keeping this Code current. 
    The new City Code is presented to the officials and citizens of the City of Liberty, Missouri, in the belief that it will merit their approval.

In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all public officers is hereby adopted. The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all public officers of the city by setting forth those acts or actions that are not reasonably compatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such public officers of interest in matters affecting the city. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Business entity means any corporation, limited liability company, general or limited partnership, sole proprietorship (including a private consulting firm, person, entity or operation), joint venture, unincorporated association or firm, institution, trust, any combination of individuals and/or artificial entities, foundation, or other organization, whether or not organized for profit. 
(2)  Confidential information means all information which is: (i) specifically identified and termed as being confidential, (ii) communicated orally or in writing, and (iii) of such a nature that it is not, at the time of such communication, a matter of public record or public knowledge.

b.  Gifts to public officers from their family members. 
(4)  Interest means direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit accruing to a public officer as a result of a contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter which is or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the city except for such contracts, transactions, zoning decisions or other matters which by their terms and by the substance of their provisions confer the opportunity and right to realize the accrual of similar benefits to all other persons and/or property similarly situated. For the purpose of this section, an interest in a matter shall be attributed to the public officer if the interest in the matter is held by: 
a.  The public officer's spouse or dependent children;

(7)  Substantial contractual relationship means a contractual relationship, either orally or in writing, in which the public officer will or reasonably expects to receive financial benefits equal to or exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) in any calendar year, provided however, a commercially reasonable loan made to a public officer in the ordinary course of business by an institution which is authorized by the laws of this state or of the United States to engage in the making of such loans shall not be deemed to create an interest in violation of this ordinance, and provided further, a reasonable commercial contractual obligation, even though greater in value than five hundred dollars ($500.00), shall not be deemed to create an interest in violation of this section. 
(c)  Conflicts of interest. 
(1)  Interest in contract, transaction, zoning decision or other matter.

Elective and appointive officers shall not use city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as municipal policy for the use of officials in the conduct of official business. 
(7)  Special treatment. No elective or appointive officer, acting in his or her official capacity, shall grant a special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is reasonably available to other citizens similarly situated, provided however, no provision hereof shall be deemed to prohibit members of the council from addressing and seeking to redress grievances of their constituents as part of their essential legislative function. 
(8)  Canvassing elected public officers. 
a.  No person shall wilfully canvass any member of the city council, directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration for employment in the municipal service.

(5)  Create an economic incentive for development of a certain magnitude in terms of dollars invested, number of new employees and wages paid to those employees; and certain types of science and technology/office development to locate and expand in the city, consistent with the Economic Development Component of Blueprint for Liberty, as amended, and the Economic Development Incentives Policy, as amended.

    Collateral will be required on all city investments and funds on deposit with the depository bank, other than investments which are obligations of the United States government and its agencies, in compliance with RSMo 110.010. The city considers repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements as simultaneous sales and purchases of securities rather than as collateralized loans.

(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-11. - Safekeeping and custody.

Purchase or sale of a security will be on a delivery versus payment basis, with title to the security passing to the city when funds are transferred to the banker/dealer. 
(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-12. - Diversification. 
    It is the policy of the city to diversify its investment portfolios by security type, institution/dealer and maturity. Assets held in the cash fund and other investment funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a specific issuer or a specific class of securities. 
    With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities, government pools collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements, no more than fifty (50) per cent of the entity's total investment portfolio will be deposited with a single financial institution/primary dealer. Repurchase agreements shall not exceed twenty-five (25) per cent of the city's total portfolio on any one day, unless the director of finance makes an exception. 
(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-13. - Maximum maturities. 
    Maturity limitations will depend upon whether the funds being invested are considered short-term to meet cash flow requirements or long-term funds reserved for capital projects (i.e., bond sale proceeds). Investments shall be limited to maturities not exceeding three (3) years, except for special situations as directed by the director of finance. This policy limits principal risk caused by changes in interest rates or longer maturities. 
    The city must collateralize repurchase agreements using securities with maturities which do not exceed three (3) years. Funds may be invested in longer maturities, and other secured instruments upon adoption of a motion of authorization by the majority of the city council at a regular or special public meeting. 
(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-14. - Internal control. 
    The director of finance will establish a system of internal controls, documented in writing, to assure compliance with state laws, policies, and procedures. 
    In order to protect against collusion, the director of finance will assign separate responsibility for operational functions from those of financial record keeping. The director of finance, as investment officer, will have authority to approve all decisions relating to investment of idle funds but will not have access to those assets, or be responsible for recording transactions in the general ledger. It will be the director of finance's responsibility to test actual results against budgeted expectations and the results of other governmental entities. Detection controls will include monthly bank account reconciliation, reconciliation of securities held by the city, and an independent test of performance with a segregation of duties assigned to accounting personnel. 
    These controls shall be designed to prevent loss of public funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets, or imprudent actions by employees and officers of the city. Internal controls will be reviewed for effectiveness annually by an independent auditor. 
(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-15. - Performance standards. 
    The investment portfolio will be designed to obtain a market average rate of return during budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city's investment risk constraints and cash flow needs. Performance statistics will include comparison of yields to average ninety-day and one hundred eighty-day treasury bill rates. Results of the comparisons will be weighted against cash flow requirements during the investment period.

(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94)

(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-17. - Investment policy adoption. 
    The city's investment policy shall be adopted by resolution of the city council. The policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the director of finance and any modifications made thereto must be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 6867,  1, 7-25-94) 
Sec. 13-18. - Award of bids. 
    The city council hereafter reserves the right to reject any bid received by them or defer action on awarding any bid of any kind received by them until the next regularly scheduled city council meeting or any special city council meeting called by the mayor. 
    The intent of this section shall be included in whole or part in any proposed invitation for bids prepared by the city.

(f)  While it shall be prima facie proof of violation for a vehicle not displaying a disabled license plate, placard or sticker to occupy a space reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles which so display the same, it shall be an adequate defense to prosecution for such offense if the defendant shall establish, by any lawful proof, that the vehicle was, upon the particular occasion, actually used for the transportation of a physically disabled and handicapped person. The burden of proof of such defense shall rest upon the defendant if such defense is offered. 
(g)  Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this article shall be punishable as prescribed in section 20-167 of this cable.

The mayor shall then conduct an investigation, comparing applicant's business with other businesses of like nature and shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed by this chapter is unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to applicant's business and shall fix as the license fee for the applicant, an amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or, if the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the mayor shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fees as prescribed in section 24-4. Should the mayor determine the gross sales measure of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales, and pay the amount of fee therefor; provided, that, no additional fee during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license as prescribed in this section.

Reseller service providers shall not be required to obtain a franchise or agreement but shall be required to register with the city prior to providing service on forms provided by the city. 
(1)  Franchise. A franchise shall be required from the city in conformance with all applicable franchise procedures for any ROW user seeking to use the rights-of-way for purposes of providing or distribution of electricity, gas, water, steam, lighting, or sewer public utility service in the city, except where otherwise provided by law. Such franchise may be granted only after satisfaction of all applicable procedural or substantive requirements established by charter or other law. 
(2)  ROW use agreement. A ROW use agreement with the city shall be required for all ROW users not set forth in subsection (1), irrespective of any state licensing, franchise, or certificate that may also be held by the ROW user, except as otherwise required herein or by law. Such agreements shall conform to all applicable law, but shall not be subject to procedures applicable to franchises and the city may, if appropriate, approve form agreements that may be executed by the mayor after approval by the city council. 
(3)  License. Incidental uses of the public rights-of-way may be permitted without a franchise or ROW use agreement pursuant to a license issued by the public works director. The public works director may establish such application, requirements, and conditions applicable to such uses consistent with the purposes of this article or as otherwise established by law. Any person granted a license hereunder shall be subject to the applicable requirements of this article. 
(b)  Franchises and agreements nonexclusive. The authority granted by the city in any agreement or franchise shall be for nonexclusive use of the rights-of-way. Such grant does not in any way limit the continuing authority of the city through the proper exercise of its statutory powers to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights to use the rights-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all applicable law. The granting of an agreement or franchise shall not be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in favor of the ROW user nor shall it create any relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment between the parties. 
(c)  No warranty. The city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way and shall not be liable for any damage therefrom. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon the ROW user. The ROW user shall be solely liable for any damages to facilities or other property due to excavation or other ROW work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities. The ROW user shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation, or replacement of damaged or disturbed facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities. 
(d)  Use of city or third-party facilities . No ROW use agreement, franchise, or license shall grant the right to use facilities owned or controlled by the city or a third party, and no such use shall occur, without the express written consent of such party (on file with the city and subject to other applicable requirements), nor shall any franchise, ROW use agreement, or license excuse such person from first obtaining a pole attachment agreement or other express consent for such right or use before locating on the facilities controlled or owned by the city or a third party. 
(e)  Lease required for public lands. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any facilities in, on, or over public lands of the city not constituting rights-of-way shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms and conditions as the city may require. 
(f)  Transferability. Except as provided in this article or as otherwise required by law, no franchise, agreement, license, other written authorization, or rights-of-way permit may be transferred without the written application to and consent of the city based on the requirements and policies of this article. The city shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to transfer as provided herein, but any costs incurred shall be paid by the applicant. 
(g)  Forfeiture of agreement and privilege. In case of failure on the part of the ROW user, including its successors and assigns to comply with any of the provisions of this article or a ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other authorization, or if the ROW user, its successors and assigns should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of this article or the terms of the authorization of such use, or otherwise loses authority to provide its service in the city, the ROW user, its successors and assigns shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by this article and any ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other authorization, and all rights hereunder shall cease, terminate, and become null and void, provided that said forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the following proceedings: Before the city declares the forfeiture or revocation of a ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other authorization, it shall first serve a written notice upon the person setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the person shall have thirty (30) days thereafter, or such other reasonable period established by the city council, in which to cure the default by complying with the conditions of the ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other authorization or requirement and fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of such period the city determines that the conditions have not been complied with and that the person did not reasonably and in the public interest require more than thirty (30) days to cure the default, the city shall take action by an affirmative vote of the city council present at the meeting and voting to terminate the ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other authorization, setting out the grounds upon which said agreement or other authorization is to be forfeited or revoked. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking any other remedy or from declaring immediate forfeiture where the default is incapable of being cured by the ROW user, including where such defaults or violations have repeatedly occurred. 
(h)  Application for franchise or agreement required. 
(1)  Application. An application for franchise or ROW use agreement shall be presented to the public works director in writing and shall include all such information as is required by this section. The ROW user shall be responsible for accurately maintaining the information in the application during the term of any franchise or agreement and shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the city due to the failure to provide or maintain as accurate any application information required herein. 
(2)  Application fee. An application deposit fee for review, documentation and approval of such agreement or franchise shall be established by the public works director to recover any actual costs anticipated and incurred by the city in reviewing, documenting, or negotiating such agreement or franchise, provided that no costs shall be included if such inclusion is prohibited by applicable law as to that applicant. If the actual costs are thereafter determined to be less than the application deposit fee, such amount shall be returned to the applicant after written request therefrom; if the actual costs reasonably exceed the application fee, applicant shall, after written notice from the city, pay such additional amount prior to issuance by the city of any final approval. The city may require compensation for use of the ROW or other public property as may be reasonably required by the city council, subject to applicable law. 
(3)  Application form. A ROW user shall submit a completed application for franchise or ROW use agreement on such form provided by the city, which shall include information necessary to determine compliance with this article, including but not limited to: 
a.  Identity and legal status of the ROW user; 
b.  Name, address, telephone number, and email address of each officer, agent, or employee responsible for the accuracy of the application. Each officer, agent, or employee shall be familiar with the local facilities of the ROW user, shall be the person(s) to whom notices shall be sent and shall be responsible for facilitating all necessary communications including, but not limited to, certification to the city of any material changes to the information provided in such completed application during the term of any franchise or ROW use agreement; 
c.  Name, address, telephone number, and email address of the local representative of the ROW user who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of the ROW user in the event of an emergency; 
d.  Proof of any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise, agreement or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity including, but not limited to, the FCC or the PSC; 
e.  Description of the ROW user's intended use of the ROW, including such information as to proposed services so as to determine the applicable, federal, state, and local regulatory provisions as may apply to such ROW user; 
f.  A list of authorized agents, contractors, and subcontractors eligible to obtain rights-of-way permits on behalf of the ROW user. The list may be updated to add a person at the time of rights-of-way permit application if the updated information on the application is submitted by an authorized representative of the ROW user; 
g.  Information sufficient to determine the amount of net assets of the ROW user; 
h.  Information sufficient to determine whether the ROW user is subject under applicable law to franchising, service regulation, payment of compensation for the use of the ROW, taxation, or other requirements of the city; 
i.  Any request including one or more antennas shall also include all requirements for installation of antennas and wireless facilities set forth in article XII of chapter 30, the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act ( 67.5090 et. seq. RSMo.), and other applicable law; and 
j.  Such other information as may be reasonably required by the director to determine requirements and compliance with applicable regulation. 
(4)  Standard for approval or renewal of agreements. In reviewing an application for a new or renewal ROW use agreement or franchise, the city may consider prior conduct of the person in performance of its obligations or compliance with the city's ordinances in the past, or the existence of any outstanding violations or deficiencies. The city may deny or condition any ROW use agreement or franchise where the proposed use would interfere with the public use of the ROW or otherwise conflict with the legitimate public interests of the city or as otherwise provided by law. Applications for ROW use agreements or franchises may be approved, denied, or approved with conditions consistent with requirements of applicable law or other applicable requirements as may be necessary to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this article. 
(5)  Approval process. After submission by the ROW user of a duly executed and completed application and application fee, and executed franchise or ROW use agreement as may be provided by the public works director, or as modified by the public works director in review of the specific circumstances of the application, all in conformity with the requirements of this article and all applicable law, the public works director shall submit such franchise or agreement to the city council for approval. Upon determining compliance with this article, the city council shall authorize execution of the franchise or agreement (or a modified agreement otherwise acceptable to the city consistent with the purposes of this article), and such executed franchise or agreement shall constitute consent to use the public rights-of-way; provided that nothing herein shall preclude the rejection or modification of any executed franchise or agreement submitted to the city to the extent such applicable law does not prohibit such rejection or modification, including where necessary to reasonably and in a uniform or nondiscriminatory manner reflect the distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, public work, or safety requirements applicable to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-28. - Use by third-parties and reseller service provider requirements. 
(a)  ROW user authority; obligations . A ROW user is authorized, subject to other applicable requirements, to sell or transfer use of excess capacity to reseller service providers or other entities, provided that such entity either: (1) has no right to and does not physically access the facilities while in the ROW, or (2) has a separate franchise or ROW use agreement or other written agreement or consent authorizing the same with the city. In the event of such sale or transfer to a reseller service provider, the ROW user shall notify the city of the same prior to such action so that the city can review compliance regarding doing business in the city. This notice shall not relieve the reseller service provider from its own obligation to register, pay taxes, and obtain any necessary authorization from the city. 
(b)  Registration of reseller service providers and exempt entities. 
(1)  Reseller service provider registration. Prior to providing service (including sale or transfer of product or service) within the city or acquiring or using excess capacity through facilities in the city, reseller service providers shall register with the city the intent to do so and shall include: (1) identity of the reseller service provider and certification of the applicable regulatory approval necessary to undertake such service, (2) the name of the provider(s) owning the facilities within the city through which the service shall be transmitted; (3) name, address, telephone number, and email address of an officer, agent, or employee responsible for the accuracy of the registration, and contact information for a person to speak on behalf of the reseller service provider, if different; and (4) such other information as requested by the director. It shall be unlawful for any reseller service provider not having its own ROW use agreement, license, or franchise to have its own facilities in the rights-of-way, have the right to physically access the facilities in the rights-of-way, or to transmit service for commercial purposes through any facility owned by a person without a valid ROW use agreement or other city authorization for such facilities. It shall be the duty of a reseller service provider to report any changes to its registration information within thirty (30) days of such change. 
(2)  Exempt entity registration. Prior to providing service within the city, transmitting communications through facilities in the city, or constructing in the rights-of-way, entities not required to obtain a franchise, license, or ROW use agreement due to superseding federal or state law, shall nevertheless be required to register with the city by providing the city the information required by the rights-of-way application in section 25-27. It shall be the duty of such exempt entity to report any changes to such registration information within thirty (30) days of such change. 
(c)  Reseller service provider obligations . Any reseller service provider that buys or leases excess capacity or other services for resale from a ROW user, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this article, including the requirement to first register with the city and obtain any necessary rights-of-way permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise, or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the city, PSC or the FCC. If a person through such lease or purchase owns facilities in the rights-of-way or has the right to physically access or maintain any facilities in the rights-of-way, then such person no longer meets the definition of a reseller service provider and is required to first obtain a franchise, license, or ROW use agreement as required herein. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-29. - Rights-of-way permit required. 
    No person shall make an excavation or perform work within the rights-of-way without first obtaining a rights-of-way permit from the public works director, provided, that in case of emergency which requires immediate attention to remedy defects, in order to prevent loss or damage to persons or property, it shall be sufficient that the person making such excavation or performing work in streets, alleys, or sidewalks obtain a rights-of-way permit as soon as possible and may proceed without a rights-of-way permit when such permit cannot be obtained before starting such excavation or work. A separate special permit or lease shall be required for excavation in or use of any real property interest of the city that is not ROW. The person securing a rights-of-way permit to make an excavation or perform work in any street, alley, or sidewalk is hereby deemed to be the person, or his legal representative, making such excavation or performing such work. All rights-of-way permits shall expire after sixty (60) days from the date of issuance. A person whose application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or denied for failure to comply with this article shall not be refunded the application fee. 
    All persons shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the city in the reasonable exercise of its police power and are subject to all applicable laws, order, rules, and regulations adopted by governmental entities now or hereafter having jurisdiction. In addition, the persons shall be subject to all technical specifications, design criteria, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the city in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits and fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, surface restoration, and other requirements on the use of the rights-of-way. All persons obtaining a rights-of-way permit shall provide the public works director certificates of insurance showing proof of liability coverage for personal injury and property damage, as required herein. 
    The director may issue individual rights-of-way permits for specific proposed excavations or ROW work or may issue bulk rights-of-way permits covering multiple projects, types of actions, or locations during a period of up to one year that may be thereafter performed during that permit year. Where a bulk rights-of-way permit is proposed, the ROW user shall provide sufficient information regarding the types of actions and locations to be approved so as to allow the director to condition and ensure compliance with safety and other regulations herein. 
    Applicants may apply jointly for rights-of-way permits in the rights-of-way at the same time and place. All joint applicants must jointly execute all required documents and shall be jointly and severally liable for all duties and obligations hereunder. Persons who apply jointly may share in the payment of the application deposit fee. Such persons must agree among themselves as to the portion each shall pay. 
    Any person found to be working without a required permit, failing to provide for required safety and traffic control, or otherwise violating any requirements herein will be directed to stop work until the necessary permit is obtained, the appropriate measures are implemented in accordance with the current edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices, or the violations are discontinued or remedied in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-30. - Rights-of-way permit conditions. 
(a)  All excavations and work shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in the city specifications. 
(b)  The public works director may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a rights-of-way permit, including design, location, and nature of facilities, and the performance of the ROW user on a non-discriminatory basis in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. Each rights-of-way permit shall be deemed to incorporate the provisions of this article as rights-of-way permit conditions. 
(c)  When a rights-of-way permit is requested for purposes of installing additional facilities and the performance and maintenance bonds for additional facilities is reasonably determined to be insufficient, the posting of an additional or larger performance or maintenance bond for the additional facilities may be required by the public works director, except as otherwise provided in section 25-41 hereof. 
(d)  A ROW user shall perform all excavations or work in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the city and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Missouri, and the rules and regulations of the commission or any other local, state, or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. A ROW user shall perform all excavations or work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations and shall be responsible for all excavations or work done in the rights-of-way pursuant to its rights-of-way permit, regardless of by whom the excavation or work is done. A ROW user shall be responsible for all reasonable costs borne by the city that are directly associated with ROW user's permit or use of the rights-of-way thereunder. The ROW user shall comply with the excavation requirements of Missouri One Call established by  319.010 et. seq. RSMo., as amended. 
(e)  Except in cases of an emergency or with approval of the public works director, no rights-of-way excavation or work may be done in violation of a stop work order issued by the public works director. 
(f)  A ROW user shall not disrupt rights-of-way such that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways is interfered with. No person may park private vehicles within or next to the work or excavation area, except for such areas which may be designated and marked as safe areas for vehicle parking in accordance with an approved traffic control plan. 
(g)  If excavation or work is being done for the ROW user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the ROW user shall be responsible for ensuring that the excavation or work of said person is performed consistent with its rights-of-way permit and applicable law and shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by said person. 
(h)  The public works director may establish in the rights-of-way permit limitations on the amount of excavation or work which may occur at one time and the amount of rights-of-way which may be obstructed during construction. 
(i)  The ROW user shall, in the performance of any excavation or work required for the installation, repair, maintenance, relocation, and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all excavations or work to that necessary for efficient operation. 
(j)  The ROW user shall not permit excavation or work to remain open longer than is necessary to complete the repair or installation, and in no event may excavation or work remain open beyond the expiration of the rights-of-way permit or any approved extension. Any excavations left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector-type street shall be securely covered. Unless otherwise approved by the director in writing, all excavations shall be filled in or covered at the end of each working day. 
(k)  Nonemergency excavation or work on arterial and collector streets may not be performed during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow. The ROW user shall perform excavation or work on the rights-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, and shall not work between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The ROW user excavating in the rights-of-way shall cause the excavation to be done with the least possible injury to the pavement, sidewalk, curbing, parkway, or other surface and shall place the materials from the excavation where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The width of the excavation shall be no greater than necessary for doing the work. Except as may otherwise be provided or as determined by the director, the ROW user shall, prior to commencement of work, execute a city-approved resident-notification plan to notify residents affected by the proposed work. All construction and maintenance by the ROW user or its subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with industry standards. The ROW user shall not interfere with or alter the facilities of the city or other ROW user without their consent and shall be solely responsible for such. 
(l)  Whenever there is an excavation or work by the ROW user, the ROW user shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control and signage to the surrounding area as determined by public works director of the city. In the event the excavation or work is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the ROW user may be liable for actual damages to the city for delay caused by the ROW user pursuant to this article. 
(m)  The public works director shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional equipment in the rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of potential ROW users. In making such decisions, the public works director shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, public health and safety, the public's priority needs for the particular service, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the rights-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which are in the public interest. 
(n)  All underground mains, their service lines with ancillary appurtenances thereto shall, wherever practicable, be placed between the curb or pavement edge and sidewalk line in the section of the street known as the parkway. Where the pavement and sidewalk occupy the entire street, the underground utilities shall be located under the sidewalk. 
(o)  The ROW user shall notify the office of the public works director upon completion of the excavation or work authorized by the rights-of-way permit. 
(p)  Every person who obtains a rights-of-way permit and makes an excavation within the rights-of-way shall guarantee for a period of four (4) years the restoration of the rights-of-way in the area where such person conducted an excavation and performed the restoration. Such person shall guarantee the restoration of the rights-of-way against sagging, buckling, deterioration, or other premature failures of the restoration. During said guarantee period, the ROW user shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration, excavation, or work to the extent necessary, using any method as required by the director. Said excavation or work shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of notice from the director (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable). In the event the ROW user is required to perform new restoration pursuant to the foregoing guarantee, the director shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for such new restoration for up to an additional forty-eight (48) months, or other greater period allowed by law, from the date of the new restoration, if the director determines there was action by the ROW user not to comply with the conditions of the rights-of-way permit and any restoration requirements. The guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of the pavement surface as well as failure below the pavement surface. 
(q)  The public works director, upon the review and approval of a plan and details for trimming trees in the rights-of-way, may grant permission by permit to any person to trim trees upon and overhanging the rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with facilities of a ROW user. In the event the person severely disturbs or damages any tree in the rights-of-way to the detriment of the health and safety of the tree, the person will be required to remove and replace a tree of like size at the person's cost. The location, size, and species of any replacement tree shall be as approved by the director, unless the director approves an equivalent monetary payment in lieu of replanting. In reviewing any permit application, the public works director, may require the applicant to directionally bore around or otherwise avoid disturbance to any tree, existing facility, or other protected area in the rights-of-way. 
(r)  Upon the approved request of any party having satisfied city procedure and ordinances, a ROW user shall remove, raise, or lower its facilities temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. Except when required for a city project, the expense of such temporary removal, raising, or lowering shall be paid by the party requesting the same, and the ROW user may require such payment in advance. The ROW user must be given not less than fifteen (15) days written notice from the party detailing the time and location of the moving operations, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours advance notice from the party advising of the actual operation. 
(s)  Each ROW user shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 
(t)  Before new excavation or construction is commenced and until sodding, planting, concreting, paving, or other final surfacing is in place, which will avoid washing or spreading of dirt and mud onto other property, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall erect and maintain approved temporary erosion control measures to prevent such washing or spreading of materials. At the end of each day and as required throughout the day during the course of excavating or construction, dirt and mud on the sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way resulting from work must be removed. 
(u)  All violations of the standards and requirements herein shall be corrected within the time specified in the issuance of a written notice to correct. Action to correct violations which require immediate action shall be taken upon notification to the person by the city. Every person failing to comply with the oral or written notice shall be deemed in violation of this article. If the action is not taken within the time period specified by notice and in addition to any other remedy, the director may have the violation immediately remedied and the city's costs shall be reimbursed by the ROW user through the surety or otherwise. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent prosecution of violation of this article in the absence or in addition to the issuance of notice of violation.

Sec. 25-31. - Public safety; barricades and lights required on excavations. 
    The ROW user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing, and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the rights-of-way until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. All excavations and work shall be barricaded at the ROW user's expense in such a manner as to protect both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Such excavations, work, and barricades shall be lighted at night with danger signals in such a manner that all traffic may be warned of the existence and location of such excavations, work and barricades. All traffic control devices shall be in compliance with the city technical specifications and the manual of traffic control devices (MUTCD). 
    All signs shall respond to high-level warning and low-level guidance devices around the excavated area. All surplus excavation or work materials, tools, or supplies at the site of the excavation or work shall be barricaded and lighted at night in the manner described in this section. No open excavation may be left in the pavement area without placing street plates over the opening. The placement of street plates shall be in compliance with section 25-34.

Sec. 25-32. - Inspection and acceptance of excavations after backfilling and settlement. 
    When an excavation has been made within the limits of any rights-of-way and after the same has been properly backfilled, the person making the excavation shall notify the public works director that the same is ready for final repair. The public works director or his duly authorized agent shall immediately inspect the same, and if he finds that such excavation has been properly backfilled, the person shall complete the restoration of the surface of such rights-of-way, all in accordance with the city specifications for street restoration. 
    The judgment of the public works director or his authorized agent as to when an excavation has been properly backfilled to permit final repair shall be conclusive. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-33. - Final repair of excavations-specifications. 
    After inspection and acceptance of excavations by the public works director, the person holding the rights-of-way permit shall be responsible for restoration of excavated surfaces. Immediately after any excavation or work is completed and prior to expiration of the rights-of-way permit, the ROW user shall restore the rights-of-way in a manner complying with applicable standards and specifications set forth in the city specifications. If the excavation is not properly completed and restored by the expiration of the rights-of-way permit, the city may, in addition to all other remedies, perform the restoration and completion and obtain reimbursement for such costs from the ROW user or surety, provided that if the city provides an invoice to the ROW user for such restoration, such invoice shall be paid in not more than thirty (30) days of such invoice.

Sec. 25-34. - Private street plate bridging regulations. 
(a)  Any person with a rights-of-way permit is authorized to use street plate bridging (SPB) to cover open excavations, prior to backfill and restoring the street surface suitable for public use, however, no person shall place steel plate bridging over an open excavation without first applying and obtaining a permit from the public works director. Such street plate bridging permit shall be limited to thirty (30) days, unless otherwise approved the public works director. 
(b)  The fee for obtaining a SPB permit shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). For the first twenty-one (21) days there will be no additional daily permit fee. A daily permit fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be imposed commencing on the twenty-second day after the SPB permit issuance and each day thereafter. If the SPB is placed prior to obtaining a permit, the permit application fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) and the daily permit fee begins immediately and will be doubled; except in cases where such placement was required by an emergency, in which case the SPB permit must be applied for and obtained the next regular working day after the SPB is placed.

    The public works director may deny an application for a rights-of-way permit if: 
(1)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, fails to provide all the necessary information requested by the city for managing the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has a history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city. For purposes of this section, "history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city" shall include the ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, that has failed to return the public rights-of-way to its previous condition under a previous rights-of-way permit or has violated terms, or is in violation of terms of the ROW user's franchise, rights-of-way use agreement, license, or other authorization with the city. 
(3)  The city has provided the ROW user with a reasonable, competitively neutral, and nondiscriminatory justification for requiring an alternative method for performing the excavation or work identified in the rights-of-way permit application or a reasonable alternative route that will not result in additional installation expense of more than ten (10) per cent to the ROW user or a declination of service quality. 
(4)  The city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety, provided that the authority of the city does not extend to those items under the jurisdiction of the PSC, such denial shall not interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private property, and such denials shall only be imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. In determining whether denial of a rights-of-way permit application is necessary to protect the public health and safety, the public works director may consider one or more of the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the rights-of-way space where the rights-of-way permit is sought is available, including the consideration of competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way, or other general conditions of the rights-of-way. 
b.  The applicability of any ordinance, code provision, or other regulations that affect the location of facilities in the rights-of-way. 
c.  The degree and nature of disruption to the public, businesses, and surrounding communities that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way, including whether the issuance of a rights-of-way permit for the particular dates and/or times requested would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. 
(5)  The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by state statute or federal law or is a historic district defined by local ordinance. 
(6)  The failure to comply with applicable city ordinances, state or federal law or regulation, or any other violation, unsafe conditions, or damage or threatened harm to the rights-of-way or public that would constitute a lawful basis for revocation of a rights-of-way permit. 
(7)  To the extent permitted by law, the person does not have a current franchise, license, rights-of-way use agreement, or other required authorization with the city. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-37. - Deposit with public works director. 
    Unless otherwise provided by law, a ROW user shall submit a deposit with the public works director sufficient in amount to ensure payment for the proper repair of such excavation or work in accord with the terms of this article and other city ordinances and to insure and protect the city from all damage that may arise from such excavations or work prior to acceptance by the city, after proper backfilling. Such deposits shall be returned one hundred eighty (180) days after an excavation has been backfilled and after an inspector has reported the excavation or work to have been properly repaired. Any party claiming exemption from the requirements of this subsection shall, prior to the subject excavation or work, so state in writing to the city, setting forth the factual and legal basis for such exemption in verified form. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-38. - Rights-of-way permit fees. 
    Every person required to obtain a rights-of-way permit shall pay a fee to the city for such permit in accordance with the fee schedule on file with the public works director to reimburse the city for its actual costs incurred and anticipated from the rights-of-way permit, inspections, and applicant's use of the rights-of-way, and including the city's rights-of-way management costs and as may otherwise be permitted by law. Any person making a street cut before obtaining a rights-of-way permit shall pay double the normal permit fee, except for emergencies, in addition to any other violation penalty as may be imposed under this article or applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-39. - Map, design, and location. 
(a)  Exclusion of certain locations/facilities . Prior to its installation of any facilities in the rights-of-way, and after applicant provides the city with its proposed plans, the city may, in its discretion, designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-of-way to be excluded from use by the ROW user, including but not limited to, ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of the director, do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the provider's facilities, or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof, is incompatible with the proposed facilities, or would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation. The director may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the ROW user due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other limitations, or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the ROW user, the city will cooperate in good faith with the ROW user to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for the ROW user. 
(b)  Location, type, and design of facilities subject to approval . 
(1)  Review required. The design, location, and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the director. Such review shall be on a non-discriminatory basis in application of city policy and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. Except as provided herein, all facilities constructed after the date of this article shall be placed underground, and in conduit, where capable. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions, and general city policies with regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall also be applicable to all facilities. The director may establish such regulations or policies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to affect this provision. 
(2)  Underground facility location. All underground mains and service lines with ancillary appurtenances thereto shall, wherever practicable, be placed between the curb or pavement edge and sidewalk line in the section of the street known as the parkway. Where the pavement and sidewalk occupy the entire street, the underground facilities shall be located under the sidewalk, unless otherwise directed by the director. 
(3)  Above-ground facilities. All new facilities may be located above-ground only if approved by the city council for good cause. Unless extraordinary circumstances exist, good cause shall not include authorization for above-ground facilities requiring new poles or major modification to existing above-ground structures. Above-ground pedestals, vaults, cabinets, or other facilities may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Existing conduit shall be used where feasible and available. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate rights-of-way exists, the ROW user shall place above-ground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible. 
(4)  Use of existing facilities required; exceptions . All new facilities or structures shall collocate on existing poles or within existing conduit, trenches, or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of rights-of-way space, reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions, to reduce the cost to the public or others therefrom, and to maximize the public's ability to use and license appropriate private or public uses of the rights-of-way in the public interest (except where preempted by law or where good cause is established as determined by the city applying these objectives). Where existing poles or facilities are available, or exist at or near the proposed use, unless otherwise approved, the applicant must either use such facilities or file a written request verified by the applicant for exception specifying the specific reasons why such facilities are not available or feasible to be used and addressing the objectives hereof. 
(c)  Priority of uses. ROW user's use shall be in all situations subordinate and subject to public municipal use. In situations where multiple users are within the same location, first the municipal use shall have priority followed by persons with a valid and current ROW use agreement, franchise, license, or other required written authorization with the city, followed by all others. 
(d)  Site triangle maintained. ROW users shall comply with the requirements of site triangles and nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision within the triangular area formed by the rights-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points thirty (30) feet from their point of intersection or at equivalent points on private street. 
(e)  Where an application is made for a rights-of-way permit for a ROW user to install or repair its facilities, the applicant shall submit a map or plat of where the work is to take place. Such plat or map shall be specific as to location and depth of the work, as to street address or other location. For excavations or work involving a street or curb, a traffic control plan shall be required and approved by the public works director before beginning work.

Sec. 25-40. - Wireless facilities. 
(a)  Wireless antennas and facilities. Pursuant to city authority, including section 67.1830(f) RSMo., and to properly manage the limited space in the city's rights-of-way, minimize obstructions and interference with the use of the rights-of-way by the public, and to ensure public safety, preserve property values, and enforce the public policy to maintain neutrality as to ownership of wireless locations, while also seeking to facilitate delivery of broadband technologies to city residents and businesses, wireless facilities shall be permitted in the rights-of-way only in compliance with the requirements applicable to other facilities and ROW users in the rights-of-way, and the additional requirements set forth in this section for wireless antennas and facilities. Any wireless facilities authorized in the ROW shall be only as authorized in a binding approved ROW use agreement, pole attachment agreement, or other written authorization with the city and subject to approval, denial, or condition relating to location, design, height, appearance, safety, specifications for use of city structures, and such zoning, building, or other regulations, including specifically article XII of chapter 30, except as may be limited by law. 
(1)  General conditions . Any wireless facility in the ROW shall be subject to conditions relating to the location (including prohibited or limited locations), design, height, appearance, safety, radio-frequency, and other interference issues as may be lawfully imposed by the city where necessary or appropriate to protect the public, and to conform to policies and interests of the public as may be set forth in special district plans, historic areas, or other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the director to address changing infrastructure, technology, and uses of the rights-of-way and/or city facilities. 
(2)  Small wireless collocation . Any wireless facility meeting the requirements of a "fast track small wireless facility" in sections 30-17 and 30-82.3 of the Zoning Code, may be authorized to be located in the rights-of-way with approval of the director subject to the following additional requirements: 
a.  Only one small wireless facility shall be permitted per structure in the ROW; 
b.  No ground equipment shall be authorized; 
c.  No small wireless facility shall be located on a city pole or traffic signal nor in a manner which obstructs or causes a safety concern for vehicle or pedestrian traffic; and 
d.  If the proposed structure the applicant proposes to locate its small wireless facility is not structurally sound, but the director finds such to be a desired location, the director can require the applicant to install a new substantially similar structure at its cost. 
(3)  New Structures . Wireless facilities shall not be permitted in the rights-of-way on new structures, provided that if evidence warranting an exception is provided by the applicant pursuant to section 25-39(b), the city council may grant an exception authorizing a new structure for a wireless facility if it also determines on a non-discriminatory basis such proposed application is in the public interest in light of the purposes of this section and article, and provided such use and location has received prior, separate zoning authorization as required by and in compliance with article XII of chapter 30, to the extent permitted by law. In such circumstances where any new wireless structure application is permitted in the rights-of-way, such use shall be subject to reasonable regulations or conditions and including any applicable specifications, compensation, and other terms established by the city in such approval or agreement as necessary or appropriate to preserve the purposes of this section and article. 
(4)  All other wireless in ROW . Any wireless facility located on an existing structure but not meeting the requirements of subsections (2) or (3) above, may be approved, subject to conditions as may be imposed consistent with the purposes of this section, only upon approval by the council upon a determination by the council that such wireless facility is: (1) in the public interest to provide a needed service to persons within the city, (2) cannot feasibly meet all of the requirements of a "small wireless" but varies from such requirements to the minimum extent necessary, (3) does not negatively impact appearance or property values in light of the location, design, and circumstances to be approved, (4) does not create any reasonable safety risk, and (5) complies with all zoning, ROW, and other applicable requirements. 
(b)  Wireless facility compensation . Compensation shall be as follows unless otherwise lawfully provided for in the agreement authorizing such use: Pursuant to its authority including under  67.1830(6)(f) RSMo., and as may be authorized by  67.5094(11) RSMo., the ROW user wishing to install small wireless facilities within the rights-of-way shall pay to the city, in addition to any other fee provided in this article, a one-time administrative and zoning fee of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per each wireless antenna installation to partly cover the city's costs and risks, including as may relate to the use of city rights-of-way. 
(c)  Application requirements. Any application including one or more wireless antennas or facilities shall include all requirements for: (1) installation of any facilities in the ROW as set forth in this article, (2) this section, and (3) installation of wireless antennas and facilities set forth in article XII of chapter 30, the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act ( 67.5090 et. seq. RSMo.), and other applicable law including written proof of consent of landowner (copy of the ROW use agreement) and of the structure owner (document authorizing use of the structure). 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-41. - Liability insurance, performance and maintenance bond requirement. 
    Except as provided in this section, each ROW user shall provide, at its sole expense, and maintain during the term of an agreement or franchise, commercial general liability insurance with a reputable, qualified, and financially sound company licensed to do business in the State of Missouri, and unless otherwise approved by the city, with a rating by best of not less than "A," that shall protect the ROW user, the city, and the city's officials, officers, and employees from claims which may arise from operations under an agreement or franchise, whether such operations are by the ROW user, its officers, directors, employees and agents, or any subcontractors of the ROW user. This liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property, resulting from all ROW user operations, products, services or use of automobiles, or construction equipment. The amount of insurance for single limit coverage applying to bodily and personal injury and property damage shall be in no event less than the individual and combined sovereign immunity limits established by RSMo  537.610 for political subdivisions; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive the city's sovereign immunity. An endorsement shall be provided which states that the city is listed as an additional insured with full and equivalent coverage as the uncured under the insured's policy and duty of defense by insurer to the city, and stating that the policy shall not be cancelled or materially modified so as to be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, or not renewed without thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such event being given to the public works director. A copy of the policy shall be provided to the city upon request. If the person is self-insured, it shall provide the city proof of compliance regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in the above amounts. Any self-insurance or deductible above fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) must be declared to and pre-approved by the city. The insurance requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period during an agreement or franchise as ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to RSMo  67.1830(6)(a) and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise, therefore, so exempted unless otherwise provided by agreement or franchise. The city reserves the right to waive any and all requirements under this section when deemed to be in the public interest. 
    Except as otherwise may be required by law for ROW users who have on file with the deputy city clerk an affidavit certifying that the ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise, therefore, exempted, a person shall at all times during the term of a rights-of-way permit, and for four (4) years thereafter, maintain a performance and maintenance bond in a form approved by the city attorney. The amount of the bond will be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or the value of the restoration as determined by the director, whichever is greater, for a term consistent with the term of the rights-of-way permit plus four (4) additional years, conditioned upon the person's faithful performance of the provisions, terms, and conditions conferred by this article. Unless otherwise established by the rights-of-way permit, an annual bond in an amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) automatically renewed yearly during this period shall satisfy the requirement of this section. In the event the city shall exercise its right to revoke the rights-of-way permit as granted herein, then the city shall be entitled to recover under the terms of said bond the full amount of any loss occasioned. 
    A copy of the liability insurance certificate and performance and maintenance bond must be on file with the deputy city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-42. - Facility relocation. 
(a)  A ROW user shall promptly remove, relocate, or adjust any facilities located in the rights-of-way or in public easements as directed by the city for a public improvement or as necessary to eliminate a threat to public safety. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the ROW user at the ROW user's sole expense without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations, and schedules of the city pertaining to such. The ROW user shall proceed with the removal, relocation, or adjustment of facilities with due diligence upon notice by the city to begin removal, relocation, or adjustment and complete such removal, relocation, or adjustment within the timeframe established by the city. Where the ROW user facilities are located in whole or in part in private easements, the ROW user shall promptly relocate the facilities if the city has agreed to compensate the ROW user, through the condemnation, purchase process, or other reasonable means for the cost of relocation of the ROW user's facilities. 
(b)  The city shall provide the ROW user with written notice of required relocations or adjustments, the anticipated bid letting date if any of the public improvement, and notice of the deadline for completion of the relocations or adjustments. The ROW user shall respond within ten (10) days with any conflicts and a proposed construction schedule for relocation to be completed in not more than sixty (60) days from date of the notice to ROW user, unless such other schedule is requested and reasonably approved by the director. If facilities cannot be fully relocated within the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall be responsible at its own cost to obtain alternative locations to timely relocate its facilities. 
(c)  Any damages suffered by the city, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by the ROW user's failure to timely relocate, remove, or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate, remove, or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the ROW user. Where the ROW user shall fail to relocate facilities as required by the city, the city may, but shall not be required to, upon notice to the ROW user remove the obstructing facilities with or without further delay and the ROW user shall bear all responsibility and liability for the consequences therefrom, and the city shall bear no responsibility to the ROW user or others for damage resulting from such removal; provided that the ROW user has failed to relocate the facilities within the time frame required by the city. Failure to comply with the relocation schedule set by the public works director shall also subject the ROW user to penalties as provided for violation of this article.

Sec. 25-43. - Rights-of-way vacation. 
    The city retains the right to vacate any rights-of-way within the city. The city may condition vacation of its rights-of-way on granting and recording of an acceptable easement authorizing the city to use the vacated area, or a portion thereof, for specific purposes as may be deemed appropriate in the public interest. The city may also condition such vacation on payment of any relocation costs that may result from such vacation. In the event that the vacation of rights-of-way requires relocation of facilities of a ROW user, such user shall bear all costs of relocation or removal of its facilities unless otherwise provided by the party initiating the vacation. In no event shall the city be obligated to pay for relocation costs due to a vacation of rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-44. - Abandoned and unusable facilities. 
(a)  A person owning facilities in the rights-of-way shall not abandon the facilities or otherwise ceases to use the facilities for longer than one year unless, prior to doing so, the ROW user satisfies one of the following: 
(1)  Provides written notice of such intention, and removes its facilities in compliance with all requirements and replaces or restores any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense; or 
(2)  Provides information satisfactory to the city that the ROW user's obligations for its facilities in the rights-of-way will be lawfully assumed by another authorized ROW user, including proof of a franchise, ROW use agreement, license,, or other required written authorization; or 
(3)  Submit to the city a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If the ROW user proceeds under this subsection, the city may, at its option, (1) purchase the equipment, (2) require the ROW user, at its own expense, to remove it, or (3) require the ROW user to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities, except as otherwise provided herein. 
    The public works director may allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the public works director determines that it is in the best interest of public safety to do so. 
(b)  Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the person. 
(Ord. No. 10831,  IV(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 25-45. - Revocation of rights-of-way permits. 
    The city may, after reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure, revoke a rights-of-way permit granted to a ROW user, without a fee refund, if one or more of the following occurs: 
(1)  A material violation of a provision of this article or a rights-of-way permit, including the violation of any provision of this article or of any additional provisions of a specific permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the rights-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  A material misrepresentation of fact in the rights-of-way permit application; 
(4)  A failure to complete excavation or work by the date specified in the rights-of-way permit, unless a rights-of-way permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the excavation or work is due to reasons beyond the ROW user's control; 
(5)  A failure to correct, within the time specified by the city, excavation or work that does not conform to applicable national safety codes, industry construction standards, or applicable City Code provisions or safety codes that are no more stringent than national safety codes or provisions, upon inspection and notification by the city of the faulty condition; or 
(6)  Such other lawful reasons. 
    If a rights-of-way permit is revoked, the ROW user shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including administrative costs, restoration costs, and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

(c)  No cause of action against the city . A ROW user shall have no damages remedy or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any ROW use agreement, license, franchise, or other written authorization or because of the enforcement thereof by said city, or from the use of the rights-of-way. Nothing herein shall preclude the ROW user from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city where such relief is otherwise available and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied. 
(d)  Indemnification.

Chapter 27 - TAXATION[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The provisions of Ch. 27 have been brought into conformity by the editor, as far as possible, with the restructured city offices effected by Ord. No. 3636. The city advises that it no longer has an assessor; thus,  27-8-27-12 should be considered in light of the fact that the city obtains its assessments from county records. Sections 27-14-27-17 should also be considered in this way. The city no longer has a poll tax; section 27-9 is thus affected.

Sec. 29-14. - Procedure for contracting for construction; operating waterworks system. 
    The doing of all work and the furnishing of all supplies for the construction, operating and maintaining of the system of waterworks shall be let out by the city council in the same manner as other public work is let out, except in cases where it is not practicable to do such work or furnish such material by contract, and all contracts shall be submitted to the city council for approval; except, that in circumstances wherein a developer or subdivision owner, or other person or firm, desiring water mains and extensions for which such developer or subdivision owner or other person or firm is to pay for such water lines and extensions, the following plan and procedure shall be followed: 
(1)  The city council is hereby authorized to execute contracts for water main extensions, as prescribed in this article. 
(2)  Water main extensions shall include no mains smaller than eight (8) inches in size, and hydrants shall be spaced according to the then existing design criteria of the utilities department; provided, however, that the city council or its designated representative may require: 
a.  The use of smaller mains in areas otherwise provided with fire protection; 
b.  The use of mains larger than eight (8) inches, in which case the city shall bear the difference between the estimated cost of the larger main and an eight-inch main, unless in the judgment of the city council such larger main is required or needed by the applicant for such water main extension. 
The main extension shall include as an integral part thereof such tap or outlet on the existing city-owned main as may be required to permit connection of the main extension to the existing system of the city. 
(3)  All water main extensions shall be constructed by the applicant for the water main extension; provided, however, that the city council, at its discretion, and if in its judgment circumstances so warrant, may arrange for the extension to be constructed by the city by contract awarded on the basis of competitive bids. 
(4)  If the main extension is constructed by the applicant, the applicant or his agent, servant, employee, independent contractor or such other person, firm, partnership, corporation or association by whom such work is to be performed, shall file with the utilities director a construction and maintenance bond approved by the utilities director in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the project, conditioned as required, if bond for public works, and that such work will be done in accordance with the utilities department standard specifications and guaranteeing the work and maintenance of trenches for a period of two (2) years from the date of acceptance of the work. 
Before commencing work upon such project, the applicant or his agent, servant, employee, independent contractor or such other person, firm, partnership, corporation or association by whom such work is to be performed shall also file with the utilities director a certificate or policy of public liability insurance in favor of the city, conditioned to protect and save harmless the city from all claims for damage to property or injury to persons by reason of such construction work, and indemnifying the city on account of such claims or injuries; the surety and amount of said insurance to be approved by the utilities director. 
(5)  Except in unusual circumstances, the detailed plans shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer employed by the applicant. The utilities director, for a water main extension, shall make rules and regulations by which an applicant may accomplish the engineering design of water main extensions by a registered professional engineer in private employment. The contract for a water main extension to be accomplished in accordance with such rules and regulations shall include a deposit of four (4) per cent of the estimated cost of an eight-inch or smaller water extension, as determined by the city council; however, the minimum amount to be deposited shall be the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00), this deposit to be a nonrefundable charge covering the cost of supervision of construction, flushing, chlorination and other overhead costs of the city. 
(6)  If because of such circumstances, the main extension should be designed by the city rather than by the applicant's engineer as provided in the preceding paragraph, the applicant for the water main extension shall deposit with the utilities director, at the time of making application, a sum equal to five (5) per cent of the estimated cost of an eight-inch or smaller water main extension, as determined by a preliminary study by the utilities director; provided, however, the minimum amount to be deposited shall be the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00), this amount to be a nonrefundable charge to the applicant to cover the cost of design. After the plans and specifications for any water main extension have been prepared by the city, the applicant for such extension shall enter into a contract for the construction of such extension and shall make an additional deposit to the city in the amount of fifteen (15) per cent of the estimated cost of an eight-inch or smaller water main extension, less the amount deposited with the application. This additional deposit shall be a nonrefundable charge covering the engineering, design, supervision of construction, flushing, chlorination and other overhead costs of the city. 
(7)  The applicant for any water main extension to be constructed by the city shall make a deposit with the city in an amount equal to the estimated cost of an 8 inch or smaller water main extension, and such estimated cost shall include all costs for materials, labor, transportation, equipment and other costs, but shall include no charge for engineering, administration and other overhead costs as defined above. 
(8)  When the actual cost of any water main extension is known, the city shall refund that part of the applicant's deposit that is in excess of the actual cost. In case the deposit is less than the actual cost, the utilities director may require that the deficiency be made up by an additional deposit to be effected before any connection to the line is made by the applicant. 
(9)  All water main extension contracts authorized by this article shall stipulate that the water mains constructed by the applicant shall be the property of the city, and the control, operation and right of use thereof shall be vested wholly and exclusively in the city; and the applicant for such extension shall have no interest herein other than the right to make connections thereto in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the utilities department and existing ordinances. 
(10)  Each main extension contract shall stipulate that all construction and installation made in accordance with contracts authorized by this article shall be started within three (3) months and completed within twelve (12) months from the date of such contract, or the city council may, at its option, and upon giving written notice, cancel such contract, in which case any and all deposits shall be forfeited, and any portion of the work which had been completed shall become property of the city. 
(11)  Each main extension contract shall stipulate that the applicant shall not be entitled to refund at any time on account of original customers directly and permanently connected to any water main extension or on account of revenue collected from such customers, except as stated in subsection (m) of this section. 
(12)  Any contract entered into pursuant to this section which may involve reimbursement to the applicant for mains larger than eight (8) inches in diameter shall not be binding upon the city, unless there is affixed thereon at the time of execution a certification by the utilities director that sufficient funds are available to meet the obligation being occurred. 
(13)  No property or lot in the vicinity of any water main built hereafter and pursuant to this ordinance which is not owned by an "applicant" (any person causing a water main to be installed for the benefit of lots or property owned by him) either when the main is constructed or when a water connection is sought for such property or lot shall be directly supplied with water from the main until the sum of four hundred dollars ($400.00) is paid to the city for reimbursement as provided below. This shall be in addition to other connection charges imposed by the city. Such amount shall be paid before any water is supplied from the main constructed. If any existing main is replaced by another main by either the city or any other party, those parties who received water service through the existing main shall not be liable for any charge as a result of subsequently connecting to the larger main. In no event is the applicant or party installing the main to receive more than the actual cost of installing that portion of the line adjacent to non-owned property; and further, as to any portion of the line which also adjoins or adjoined, when built, the applicant's land, the applicant shall receive no more than fifty (50) per cent of the cost of such adjoining portion of line. The applicant shall be entitled to amounts equal to monies collected, payable to him as collected, until the agreed-on estimated or cost of installation, whichever is less, is paid in full. 
    The words developer and owner as used above are to be construed to mean and include developer, subdivision owner, owner and other persons, firms or corporations desiring water main extensions.

Sec. 29-47.18.1. - Private stormwater mitigation program authorized. 
(a)  Purpose. The city owns and operates a sanitary sewer system. Connections to the public sewer system within private residences or on private property can result in significant amounts of stormwater being directed into the public sanitary sewer system. Stormwater in the public sanitary sewer system decreases the capacity of the system to handle sanitary sewer waste and results in increased treatment costs for the city as a whole. Stormwater in the public sanitary sewer system can result in sanitary sewer back-ups, resulting in claims against the city and increasing investigation, litigation and insurance costs. Reducing the amount of stormwater in the public sanitary sewer system is a public benefit to all residents of the city by increasing the capacity of the sanitary sewer system and reducing claims against the city and the associated costs. The city desires to implement a program to repair and replace connections to the public sanitary sewer system within private residences and on private property in order to increase the efficiency of the public sanitary sewer system and reduce costs to the city as a whole. 
(b)  Authorization. A program to reduce the amount of stormwater entering the sanitary sewer system for properties which are located within the city and have a history of sanitary sewer back-ups resulting from stormwater entering the sanitary sewer system. 
(c)  To be eligible for participation in the program: 
(1)  The property must be located within the city. 
(2)  The property must have a history of sanitary sewer back-ups which resulted at least in part from stormwater entering the sanitary sewer system. 
(3)  The property owner, or the owner's authorized representative, must contact the public works department to coordinate the scope of necessary work to the existing private sanitary system that will reduce the in-flow of stormwater into the public sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  The property owner, or the owner's authorized representative, must allow the public works department entry onto the private property at reasonable times to allow inspection of the existing private sanitary system and any work performed to address the in-flow of stormwater into the public sanitary sewer system. 
(5)  The property owner, or the owner's authorized representative, must present verifiable receipts for the reasonable cost of work directly associated with reducing the amount of stormwater entering the public sanitary sewer system. 
(6)  The property owner must agree in writing to the installation and maintenance of any equipment installed, which agreement shall be recorded with the Clay County Recorder. 
(d)  If eligible for participation in the program, a property owner may be reimbursed for actual, reasonable costs of completing the scope of work approved by the public works department and the building inspection division. For a property deemed eligible for participation in the program, reimbursement of one hundred (100) per cent of the actual, reasonable costs, up to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00). 
(e)  The public works, finance, and administration departments, with consultation from the city's attorney, are authorized to develop such forms, rules and regulations, as are necessary for the implementation of this program in accordance with this section, and the city administrator, or his/her designee, is authorized to execute agreements in accordance with the terms of this section.

Where necessary in the opinion of the director, the owner shall provide at his expense such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to treat these wastes prior to discharge to the public sewer. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the director and of the state division of health, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until such approval is obtained in writing. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(2323,  19; 3422) 
Sec. 29-47.21. - Control manholes. 
    When required by the director, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install and maintain at his expense a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage" and shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
(2323,  19; 3422)

Where installed, they shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(2323,  19; 3422) 
Sec. 29-47.23. - Backflow protection. 
    All public sewer users shall have their building sewer so constructed as to prevent backflow from mains (public sewers), and the city shall not be liable for any damages or alleged damages resulting from failure of the user to have backwater valves installed or for the improper operation of such valve. 
(2323,  19) 
Sec. 29-47.24. - Damaging sewers or appurtenances. 
    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the municipal sewage works. Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount as prescribed in section 22-70. 
(Ord. No. 2323,  20) 
Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 4956, adopted April 22, 1985, provided that the penalty set out in  22-70 was to supersede and amend all previously enacted ordinances for which the penalty was a fine not exceeding $90.00.

Sec. 29-49.2. - Surcharge for excessive concentration of suspended solids or BOD. 
(a)  Imposition. When the suspended solids content or the BOD of a waste exceeds the maximum concentration of these components in normal sewage, a surcharge, in addition to the normal sewer service charge, shall be levied and established by the formula hereinafter set forth, but in no event shall said surcharge be less than two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per month. 
(b)  Computation of amount. The surcharge shall be computed by using the formula: 
SS = Vs  0.00624  [A (BOD - 300) + B (SS - 360)] + ESC 
which shall signify the amount of surcharge based on a combination of the strengths of BOD and suspended solids (SS) above those of normal sewage as defined herein, plus an extra strength control charge. 
    The BOD component of the formula shall equal the factor of 0.00624 for converting milligrams per liter by weight to pounds per hundred cubic feet, multiplied by the volume of sewage in hundred cubic feet, multiplied by "A," the estimated cost for treatment of one pound of BOD in the raw sewage, multiplied by the concentration of BOD in milligrams per liter by weight minus 300, the strength for normal sewage. 
    The suspended solids component of the formula shall equal the factor of 0.00624 as defined in the BOD component, multiplied by the volume of sewage in hundred cubic feet, multiplied by "B," the estimated cost of treatment of one pound of suspended solids in the raw sewage, multiplied by the concentration of suspended solids in milligrams per liter, minus 360, the strength for normal sewage. 
    The extra strength control charge (ESC) shall be the actual departmental cost for each individual user, including overhead, related to obtaining, measuring and analyzing sewage samples to determine sewage strengths for billing purposes. The director shall determine the method and frequency of said testing as may be reasonable for each customer in accordance with recognized engineering practices and in conformance with city Ordinance No. 5224; provided, however, that a user shall be entitled to additional sampling at its request upon payment of additional costs therefor. In lieu of sampling and analysis by the city, the director, at his discretion, may permit a user to collect and analyze samples of its own sewage at its own expense, providing samples are taken at least annually, collected and analyzed in accordance with provisions of the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, and the results are certified by a professional engineer registered in the state. The city reserves the right to verify submitted data. 
    The symbols, letters or figures employed in the formula signify the following: 
S = Extra strength surcharge in dollars. Vs = Sewage volume in hundred cubic feet. 0.00624 = Conversion factor for milligrams per liter to pounds per hundred cubic feet. A = Unit operation and maintenance charge for BOD in dollars per pound. The amount of this charge is based on the City of Kansas City's actual cost. It will vary if it reflects any changes in Kansas City's ordinance. BOD = BOD strength in milligrams per liter. B = $0.041 = Unit operation and maintenance charge for suspended solids in dollars per pound. The amount of this charge is based on the City of Kansas City's actual cost. It will vary if it reflects any changes in Kansas City's ordinance. SS = Suspended solids strength in milligrams per liter. ESC = Extra strength control charge.  
(c)  Treatment to reduce concentration. The owner of any commercial or industrial establishment may, if so desired, treat the wastes from such establishment so as to reduce either the excess suspended solids or BOD, or both, to normal levels before discharging such wastes into the public sewers. In cases where it is believed such wastes may be deleterious to the sewage works or have an adverse effect upon the sewage treatment process or the receiving stream, the director may require treatment to reduce either or both the suspended solids and BOD to levels more closely approaching those of normal sewage before discharging said wastes into the city sewers.

ARTICLE VI. - ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES 

Sec. 30-30. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to secure an adequate level of access to services and facilities for all development within the city. The city does not intend this article to prohibit the development of land within the city, but rather to provide a means by which development that would generally not be approved by the city, because adequate public facilities and services do not currently exist, may, through the developer's provision of these facilities and services, be approved. By adoption of this article, the city intends to: 
(1)  Establish what constitutes adequate public facilities; 
(2)  Establish when the provision of adequate public facilities and services is required; 
(3)  Establish those types of development that shall not be subject to the adequate public facilities and service requirements; 
(4)  Establish a review process that ensures all development proposals are treated uniformly and fairly and in accordance with the purposes for the adoption of this article; and 
(5)  Authorize the director of public works to create administrative guidelines to support this article.

(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-32. - Applicability. 
    The requirements set forth in this article shall apply to all development applications except for those development proposals that are projected to generate no more than fifty (50) average daily vehicle trips, provided the director determines that the volume or type of traffic generated by the proposal will not create a safety hazard or cause any street or intersection to exceed its design capacity. It shall be at the discretion of the director of public works to grant relief from any provision of this article, based on information provided that may set forth conditions related to a development that would not fully require the processes of adequate public facilities concurrent with the impact of the development, provided that the spirit and purpose of the City Code is observed. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-33. - Submittal requirements. 
    For the purposes of administering this article, the city may require the preparation of a traffic study, a drainage study, an environmental impact analysis or any other additional study or expert analysis. Such study shall be prepared at the applicant's expense in accordance with the terms and direction set by the director of public works and shall be submitted with the initial development application required by the City Code for the type of development proposed. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05)

    All development applications, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be evaluated to determine the impact of the proposed development upon the city's street network. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-35.1. - Street capacity requirements; required connection. 
    All development shall have at least one direct connection to the city's continuous street network by a collector or arterial street that abuts the development and meets city improvement standards or by state regulated roadway. This connection shall be made to the development's primary major street access and be completed with the first phase of the development. This connection shall be from the limits of the development site to the point of connection to the city's continuous street network. 
(1)  Residential development shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  For every one hundred twenty-five (125) dwelling units within a development, at least one direct connection to the city's continuous street network by a collector or arterial street that abuts the development shall be required. 
b.  For developments that include more than one hundred twenty-five (125) dwelling units, an additional direct connection to the city's continuous street network by a collector or arterial street that abuts the development shall be required. This secondary connection may be to the same abutting collector or arterial street as the first connection unless the director of public works determines that the volume and/or type of traffic generated by the proposed development will create a safety hazard or cause any street or intersection to exceed its design capacity. 
(2)  Access to nonresidential development shall be determined as part of the platting or development planning process, as the case may be. The number and location of access points shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis dependent upon the impact of the projected uses for the development. At least one direct connection to the city's continuous street network via a collector or arterial street that abuts the development shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-35.2. - Street capacity requirements; required improvements. 
    In addition to providing the direct connection, the developer shall be required to improve all collector or arterial streets, as identified by the city's major street plan, that abut the proposed development along the entire limits of the development site to city improvement standards. The director of public works may determine that additional street or intersection improvements are necessary to ensure that the volume or type of traffic generated by the proposed development will not create a safety hazard or cause any street or intersection to exceed its design capacity. If these conditions are found to exist, the developer shall be required to complete any of these improvements concurrently with the first phase of the development. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-35.3. - Infill development. 
(1)  Infill development proposals shall be required to provide a direct connection to a fully improved street network. This connection shall be made to the development's primary street access and be completed with the first phase of the development. The abutting street must meet city improvement standards from the limits of the development site to the point of connection to the city's continuous street network. 
(2)  If a proposed development will generate a number of average daily vehicle trips that is less than ten (10) per cent of the total average daily vehicle trips that occur along any street to which the development will have access, the director of public works may grant relief from the improvement requirements provided it is determined that the volume and type of traffic generated by the proposed development will not create a safety hazard or cause any street or intersection to exceed its design capacity. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-36. - Sanitary sewer facilities.

(2)  Planned commercial developments should be designed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters, as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs should be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to assure minimum adverse affects on the street system and other services of the community. 
(3)  Planned industrial developments should be designed to promote the establishment of industrial parks, to permit groups of industrial buildings with integrated design and a coordinated physical plan, to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped open space. 
(4)  Planned mixed-use developments should be designed to encourage innovative neighborhoods and communities with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses. Such developments integrate a variety of land uses within close proximity to each other and offer a greater variety in type, design and layout of those uses. Planned mixed-use developments are intended as an alternative to conventional, modern, use-segregated developments for select areas of the community. However, existing characteristics and development patterns must be examined before determining if a mixed-use development is appropriate near conventional developments. Planned mixed-use zoning districts are intended as the method of integrating "nonresidential" uses into areas identified as "residential" by the comprehensive plan. However, site design, proposed uses, nearby zoning and land uses, the character of the surrounding area, and a variety of other factors shall always be considered in determining if a mixed-use development is appropriate for a given residential area.

(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-69.5. - District PD-FLEX, planned development flex district. 
    The purpose of the planned development flex district is to facilitate the development of master planned, mixed use developments containing a minimum of five hundred (500) acres. The PD-FLEX district allows a mix of land uses, densities, setbacks, and building heights for a defined area and allows for flexibility of change over an extended period of time. This zoning district is intended to encourage innovative and creative design and to facilitate a mix of uses in the development of a balanced community over an extended period of time or build out. The PD-FLEX land use designation shall require approval of a master plan in order to provide general development goals for the property. The PD-FLEX zoning district shall clearly define the purpose and intent of the property and its development limitations or allowances while being sufficiently flexible to meet the demands of increased population and evolutionary changes in such fields as architecture, transportation, and redevelopment. The PD-FLEX district must conform to the requirements of the UDO in requiring adequate standards necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    The PD-FLEX district will allow an increase or decrease of a certain prescribed percentage that result in changes in land area, increase in density or intensity of residential uses, increase in floor area, increase in lot coverage, increase in height, or changes that will increase trip generation or impacts on public facilities. The prescribed percentage allowance shall be determined as part of the Master Plan approval, shall not exceed twenty (20) per cent, and is cumulative from the original, approved plan. 
    The PD-FLEX zoning may be established as an alternative option for mixed use, master planned development larger than five hundred (500) acres. The PD-FLEX zoning requires a formally approved, overall master plan for the property. The PD-FLEX master plan shall contain, at minimum, mapped information regarding the layout of general use areas, open space, zones of use, trails, major streets and other significant public improvements. The PD-FLEX zoning regulations specify permitted uses, densities and other important development controls for each use area and the property as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.6. - District PD-FLEX, permitted uses. 
    The PD-FLEX provisions are to provide for master planned developments, incorporating both residential and non-residential uses. The objective includes designing an integrated site that includes the uses otherwise permitted in such zoning districts, and also residential uses and common open space. In district PD-FLEX, any land use may be permitted if such use or uses can be shown to provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with regard to the comprehensive plan of the City of Liberty. The permitted use or uses of property located in the planned development flex district shall be determined at the time the PD-FLEX zoning district and master plan is approved, and development within that PD-FLEX district shall be limited to those uses specifically requested as part of the application and reviewed by the planning and zoning commission and approved city council. Changes as a result of increase greater than the prescribed percentage allowance described in section 30-59.4 shall require a separate application for amendment to the original approved master plan and shall follow the same process as any other development plan amendment. Any use listed as a special use in section 30-25.5 is required to follow procedures for such use as specified in section 30-25. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.7. - District PD-FLEX, height and area regulations. 
    Minimum parking, height, setback, and area regulations shall be specified for the overall site with regard to those limitations established on similar uses in other City of Liberty zoning districts and with regard to compatibility with surrounding development. Varied regulations for any aspect may be established. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.8. - District PD-FLEX, design principles. 
    The Master Plan for a PD-FLEX district shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the following principles: 
(1)  Planned residential developments should be designed in a manner that will produce more usable open space, better recreational opportunities and safer and more attractive neighborhoods than conventional zoning and development techniques. 
(2)  Planned commercial developments should be designed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters. Control of vehicular access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs should be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to assure minimum adverse effects on the street system and other services of the community. 
(3)  Planned office, research and development and/or industrial parks should be designed to promote the establishment of groups of buildings with integrated design and a coordinated physical plan, to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped open space. 
(4)  Planned mixed-use developments should be designed to encourage innovative neighborhoods and communities with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses. Such developments integrate a variety of land uses within close proximity to each other and offer a greater variety in type, design and layout of those uses. Planned mixed-use developments are intended as an alternative to conventional, modern, use-segregated developments for select areas of the community. However, existing characteristics and development patterns must be examined before determining if a mixed-use development is appropriate near conventional developments. Planned mixed-use zoning districts are intended as the method of integrating "nonresidential" uses into areas identified as "residential" by the comprehensive plan. However, site design, proposed uses, nearby zoning and land uses, and the character of the surrounding area shall always be considered in determining if a mixed-use development is appropriate for a given residential area. The master plan shall provide appropriate relationships between use areas, both internal and surrounding, with adequate buffer areas provided if warranted. 
    The master plan shall include design guidelines or a series of guidelines and standards that regulate the site and building designs. The master plan shall also include a mechanism to create and maintain a design review committee responsible for enforcing the design standards. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.9. - District PD-FLEX, major/minor amendments. 
    Applications for amendments to a PD-FLEX Master Plan and/or PD-FLEX zoning regulations must be initiated by the developer, as defined in section 30-27 of this UDO. Amendments must conform to the requirements of the UDO in requiring adequate standards necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. If the master planned development is built-out and the developer is no longer an interested party, then fifty-one (51) per cent of the property owners within the area subject to the amendment may initiate the PD amendment. Applying the provisions of this code, the director of planning and development shall determine whether an application for an amendment to an approved PD-FLEX Master Plan and/or PD-FLEX Zoning Regulations is considered a major or minor administrative amendment. 
(1)  If one or more of the following criteria apply to the amendment application, it shall be processed as a major amendment: 
a.  Introduces new land uses not contemplated in the Master Plan; 
b.  Changes in area devoted to any use by more than the approved percentage change allowed within the Master Plan; 
c.  Changes density or intensity of residential uses by more than the approved percentage change allowed within the master plan; 
d.  Decreases the area devoted to open space to less than as required by current code, per section 30-97.6; 
e.  Constitutes a significant change in the design, i.e. change in architectural style and/or building materials different from Master Plan; 
f.  Creates new or additional impacts on adjacent properties; 
g.  Significantly changes the PD-FLEX Zoning regulations or design guidelines; 
h.  Changes the land use in an area within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of a property not owned by the developer; or 
i.  Increases impact to public infrastructure including but not limited to increased trip generation or impacts on public facilities. 
(2)  Such amendments which are not classified as major shall be processed as a minor administrative amendment pursuant to section 30-70.6.

City council action shall be taken following a recommendation by the planning commission and shall be based on the same criteria as a new PD-FLEX Plan. Approval of the application shall take the form of a resolution. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.11. - District PD-FLEX, minor amendment process. 
(a)  An application for a minor amendment to an approved PD-FLEX Master Plan and/or PD-FLEX zoning regulations shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied by the director. The criteria governing administrative action on a minor amendment shall be based on the same criteria as a new PD-FLEX Plan. 
(b)  If denied, or if the applicant does not accept the conditional approval, the applicant may appeal such determination in the same manner as set forth in section 30-21.14. 
(Ord. No. 10675,  I, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 30-69.12. - Master Plan update process.

The criteria are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. 
(1)  A property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
(3)  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired, rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
(8)  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If these resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

Proof of economic hardship shall be the burden of the property owner, and any finding in support of economic hardship shall be based solely on the hardship of the property, not conditions personal to the landowner. Application for a certificate of economic hardship shall be made to the HDRC within thirty (30) days after a certificate of appropriateness has been denied. 
(1)  Application submittal requirements. The applicant shall provide expert testimony and/or evidence necessary to allow for the evaluation of the application. Such testimony and/or evidence shall address the following: 
a.  For cases of proposed demolition, an analysis from a licensed architect or engineer experienced in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of the structure as well as the economic feasibility of rehabilitation and reuse of the existing structure. 
b.  Estimated market value of the property in its current condition. 
c.  An estimate of the proposed project costs, as well as the estimated market value of the property after completion of the proposed construction or alteration; and, in the case of demolition, the estimated market value of the property after rehabilitation for its continued use. 
d.  If applicable, estimated project costs associated with any changes recommended by the HDRC as well as the estimated market value of the property after completion of said changes. 
(2)  Review criteria. Economic hardship shall only be found when the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence that the structure has no reasonable use in its present condition; or, when the applicant is able to demonstrate that the value of the work recommended by the HDRC would be an unreasonable investment based on the overall value of the property. Demonstration of an economic hardship shall not be based on or include any of the following circumstances: willful or negligent acts by the owner; purchase of the property for substantially more than market value; failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs; failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants; or failure to provide normal tenant improvements.

Sec. 30-71.7. - Certificate of appropriateness, stop work order. 
(1)  The director shall monitor all projects that require a certificate of appropriateness to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of a certificate of appropriateness, building permit, and demolition permit. Where a project fails to comply with any part of a certificate of appropriateness or the provisions of this article, it shall be considered a violation of this UDO and, the director may issue a stop work order in writing, which states the violation and a deadline by which to rectify the violation. If the project fails to meet this deadline for compliance, a second stop work order may be issued in writing and delivered by certified mail, which shall set forth the terms of compliance and/ or necessary penalties for violation in accordance with Article I of this UDO which may be enforced. 
(2)  Whenever the director has reason to believe that an action for which a certificate of appropriateness is required has been initiated or is about to be initiated, it shall make every reasonable effort to contact the owners, occupants, contractor, or subcontractor and inform them of the application process. If a stop work order is determined to be necessary to halt an action that requires a certificate of appropriateness, a copy of the order shall be delivered to the owners, occupants, contractors, or subcontractors. A copy of the application form shall be included with the order. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-71.8. - Certificate of appropriateness, lapse in work. 
    Approval of any certificate of appropriateness shall be effective for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days, at the end of which time a building permit shall have been issued for the action(s) so authorized. In the event that a building permit has not been issued within one hundred eighty (180) days or at such time work is suspended or abandoned for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days, the certificate of appropriateness shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be required to submit a new certificate of appropriateness application for consideration by the HDRC. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-71.9. - Certificate of appropriateness, demolition. 
(1)  Demolition, in whole or in part, of individual landmarks or any contributing primary structure within a historic district is not permitted. Deterioration caused by neglect or lack of routine maintenance by the existing owner does not provide grounds for the approval of demolition. Exceptions will be considered only if: 
a.  The structure has been substantially damaged through fire, deterioration, or natural disaster; 
b.  The structure does not possess the integrity, originality, craftsmanship, and age to merit preservation; and 
c.  There is substantial evidence that it would not be physically or economically viable to rehabilitate the structure. 
(2)  Upon receipt of an application for demolition of a local landmark or contributing primary structure within a historic district, the HDRC may postpone the request for up to one hundred eighty (180) days to allow time to explore alternatives to demolition. This may include seeking an alternative use for the property, obtaining supplemental funding for repairs or rehabilitation, or marketing the property for sale. 
(3)  For applications for demolition, the city should provide notice of the proposed demolition to surrounding property owners, as outlined in section 30-22.2 of this UDO, and post a sign on the affected property indicating the proposed demolition. In cases of demolition, the owner shall permit access to the subject property for the purpose of inspections and/or appraisals required by the HDRC or city staff. 
(4)  Applications for demolition of a landmark or primary structure shall be reviewed by the HDRC and forwarded to the city council with a recommendation. The city council shall take formal action on the application. Approval shall be made by resolution of the city council.

Sec. 30-72. - District HP, design principles. 
    In addition to the criteria for approval of a certificate of appropriateness as set forth in this article, the following design principles may be used, in conjunction with design guidelines and policies adopted by the HDRC in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness and can serve as the basis for conditions of approval. These principles are based on accepted practices for historic preservation and are not intended to inhibit change, new construction, new architectural styles, or new technologies when these changes complement the existing buildings and streetscapes. Design review decisions shall be based on the same set of principles for all properties designated by the district HP, however, structures possessing a greater degree of integrity, originality, craftsmanship and historic significance may have the principles more stringently applied than those with lesser significance as determined by the HDRC. These principles shall be enforced for all alterations, construction, demolition, or repairs affecting the exterior appearance of the property. 
(1)  New buildings and additions to existing buildings: New buildings should not duplicate older styles of architecture, but must be compatible with the architecture of the district. Scale, placement on lots and street setback must conform to the scale, placement and setback of adjacent structures, especially in the context of rows of buildings and streetscapes. Styles of architecture will be controlled only to ensure that their exterior design, materials, and color are in harmony with neighboring structures. 
(2)  Alterations: Alterations shall restore a structure's original elements, materials, and appearance, if economically or physically feasible. Alterations affecting the exterior of a structure shall preserve all significant original exterior elements, including building materials, doors, windows, and decorative elements. Elements that are not original, but which may have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship, shall also be preserved. Alterations that disguise or sheath original elements and materials will not be permitted. Storefronts and commercial building facades shall be treated as a whole, and alterations to the first floor should be compatible with the upper floor(s). 
(3)  Demolition: Demolition of past additions that have disguised or sheathed original elements or facades is encouraged, as long as the intention is to restore those elements and facades. 
(4)  Relocation of buildings: Structures shall not be removed from their original site unless there is substantial evidence that it would not be practical or economical to utilize the building on its present site. If a building lies in the path of a public improvement project and if the building is worthy of preservation by virtue of its integrity, originality, craftsmanship or age, relocation may be considered as an alternative only after it is determined that the project cannot be altered to avoid the site of the historic structure. 
(5)  Exterior walls: A structure's original walls, including masonry, siding, sheathing materials, and exposed foundations, shall be maintained and preserved. Walls, siding, and sheathing materials that may not be original, but have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship, shall also be maintained and preserved. These walls, siding, and sheathing materials shall not be altered, covered or disguised by new building materials unless it is no longer feasible to maintain the significant materials. Masonry shall not be painted or stuccoed unless it is no longer feasible to maintain the significant materials. Restoration of original walls, siding and sheathing materials is encouraged. Removal of false facades that cover or disguise original walls and materials is encouraged. 
(6)  Decorative and character defining elements: Original decorative and character defining elements and those that may not be original, but have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship shall be restored, maintained, and preserved. 
(7)  Doors and windows: Original doors and windows shall be retained and preserved, including such elements as sash, glass, sills, lintels, casings, muntins, trim, frames, thresholds, and hardware. When repair is not feasible, as determined by the HDRC, replacements may be deemed appropriate, provided the appearance, detail, profile, size, and material are designed to match the original door or window, as specified in the Historic District Design Guidelines. The wholesale replacement of original windows is not permitted. Windows that are not original to the structure may be replaced in-kind or with a higher-grade material. In-kind replacements consistent with this standard shall be approved by staff. If additional doors or windows become necessary, they shall be located and designed in a sensitive manner. If it is necessary to expand original openings, it shall be accomplished in a manner that respects and complements the surrounding building elements, materials, and colors. 
(8)  Porches: Porches, porticos, stoops, entryways, loading docks and exterior stairways shall be of a scale, design, material, and color that complement the existing facade and its individual elements. Loading docks and service entrances shall be located inconspicuously and should be considered a part of a building's overall design scheme. 
(9)  Roofs: Rooflines and shapes shall not be altered. Visible roofing materials shall be compatible with other building elements and materials in terms of color, materials, and texture. The use of roofing materials appropriate to the style and period of the building is encouraged. The use of roofing materials that reflect an earlier or later style or period is discouraged. 
(10)  Mechanical equipment and weather protection devices: Mechanical and weather protection devices shall be placed and installed in a manner that is unobtrusive. 
(11)  Fences, sidewalks, decorative dividers and walls: Fences and decorative walls shall be placed and scaled in a manner that does not cover, block or damage significant building facades or elements. Fences and walls shall be of a style or period that corresponds with the style or period of the building or buildings they serve. Original fences, walls and sidewalks and those that have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship shall not be removed or destroyed and shall be maintained and preserved. 
(12)  Vacant lots, alleys, and parking areas: Parking lots, driveways, and other spaces between and around buildings shall be designed and maintained in a manner that does not detract from neighboring buildings and facades. The creation of new parking lots, driveways and parking pads shall be done in a way to minimize their appearance and to complement the buildings they serve and the surrounding neighborhood. Garbage dumpsters, bollards, loading docks and other similar fixtures shall be structurally and cosmetically maintained and shall be placed in a manner that is as inconspicuous as possible. 
(13)  Signs and awnings: Original signs or those that have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship shall be maintained and preserved. Signs that disguise, obstruct, or detract from significant facade elements shall not be allowed. Signs and awnings shall be designed to complement the style, materials, and color of the building. Lighting and other illumination shall be properly shielded or diffused to eliminate glare. Individual building mounted lights shall be no brighter than one hundred (100) watts and be mounted no lower than six (6) feet and no higher than nine (9) feet in height. All signs shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV.

Sec. 30-73. - Design subcommittee. 
    The historic district review commission may establish a design subcommittee of five (5) of its members to meet with applicants at any time during the application process to review and comment on proposed applications. An applicant may request a meeting with the subcommittee before or during the review of any application. The subcommittee may issue a certificate of appropriateness for standard applications upon the affirmative vote of four (4) of its members, when delay to the next regular meeting would create an unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant.

ARTICLE IX. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 

Sec. 30-74. - Purpose. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this UDO or previously existing regulations, there are lots, structures, uses and characteristics of uses that were lawful prior to the effective date of this UDO that would now be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of this UDO and any subsequent amendment. These instances shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconformities. 
    It is the intent of this article to recognize the legitimate interest of owners of lawful nonconformities by allowing these instances to continue, subject to the provisions contained herein. It is also recognized that nonconformities may adversely and substantially affect the development, maintenance, use, and taxable value of other properties subject to the regulations of this UDO. Therefore, it is necessary to provide regulations for the continuance of nonconformities, but to prohibit the re-establishment of certain nonconformities that have been discontinued. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-75. - Applicability. 
    Any lawfully existing structure or use that does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located shall be considered nonconforming and shall be subject to the provisions of this article. Nonconforming signs shall be subject to the provisions of Article XV of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-75.1. - Lawful nonconforming lots.

(2)  No nonconforming lot, or any portion thereof, shall be used or sold in a manner that would increase its degree of nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-75.2. - Lawful nonconforming structures. 
    Structures lawfully constructed prior to the effective date of this UDO, but which could not be constructed under the terms of this UDO by reason of restrictions on height and area regulations shall be considered lawful nonconforming structures. The use of these lawful nonconforming structures may be continued so long as they otherwise remain lawful and no other reconstruction, enlargement, or alteration increases the degree of nonconformity. A nonconforming structure may be altered to reduce the nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-75.3. - Lawful nonconforming uses. 
    Any use of land or structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this UDO or amendment of this UDO, but which would not be permitted under the provisions of this UDO, shall be considered lawfully nonconforming. This use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and is not enlarged, extended, moved, relocated, or altered in a way to increase the degree of nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-76. - Allowance of nonconformity. 
(1)  Any structure or use made nonconforming by the adoption or subsequent amendment of this UDO shall be allowed to continue without interruption or alteration subject to the provisions of this article. 
(2)  Structures that do not conform to the height and area regulations for the district in which it is located may be altered or enlarged only if changes are made in conformance with the provisions of this UDO, unless determined by the director to be ordinary maintenance. 
(3)  If a natural disaster, fire, or casualty, damages any nonconforming structure equal to fifty (50) per cent or less of its current taxable value, it may be rebuilt in its nonconforming nature within twelve (12) months of the damage. Any building damaged greater than fifty (50) per cent of its current taxable value shall only be rebuilt within the current regulations and restrictions of the district in which it is located. 
(4)  The nonconforming use of a nonconforming structure may be changed to a permitted use without affecting the nonconforming nature of the structure. However, all provisions of this article shall still apply to the structure. 
(5)  A nonconforming use may be expanded within an existing structure only without structural alterations. At such time as structural alterations are made, both the structure and the use of the structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of this UDO and the district in which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-77. - Restriction of nonconformities. 
(1)  A nonconforming structure or use under the previously existing regulations, which exists on the effective date of this UDO, shall not be in conformance solely by reason of the adoption of this UDO and shall remain nonconforming until the time that the structure or use is in full compliance with the provisions of this UDO. 
(2)  Whenever a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the lawful nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
(3)  Nonconforming structures with uses not conforming to the district in which they are located, shall not be altered or enlarged unless both the structure and the use are made to comply with all provisions of this UDO and the district in which they are located. 
(4)  A nonconforming structure intended for a use not in compliance with this UDO that was vacant for the one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days prior to the effective date of this UDO shall not be used for any use other than those permitted within the district in which the structure is located. 
(5)  The nonconforming use of a structure intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is located may not be expanded or changed to another nonconforming use. 
(6)  Any nonconforming use, which is located in a structure otherwise intended for a use permitted within the district it is located, which is stopped for the one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days prior to the effective date of this UDO shall not continue unless made to comply with the provisions of this UDO. 
(7)  A nonconforming use of land shall not be expanded beyond the area it occupies nor changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(8)  A nonconforming use of land discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days shall not be renewed unless it is made to conform to the provisions of this UDO. 
a.  The nonconforming use of land caused by the permitted use of a conforming structure shall be allowed for the duration of the use of the structure, excluding inadequate off-street parking facilities. 
b.  At such time as structures are no longer used in connection with the nonconforming use of land, such use shall be discontinued within twelve (12) months. 
c.  A nonconforming use of land that is accessory to a nonconforming use of a structure shall be discontinued at the time the use of the structure is also stopped.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Sec. II(Exh. A) of Ord. No. 11006, adopted Dec. 17, 2018, amended art. XII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. XII pertained to similar subject matter, consisted of  30-82-30-82.8, and derived from Ord. No. 10832, adopted Dec. 11, 2017. 

Sec. 30-82. - Purpose, applicability, and procedures. 
(1)  Statement of purpose. The general purpose of this article XII ("article") is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications wireless communications facilities to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City of Liberty. Specifically, this article is intended to: 
a.  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Liberty; 
b.  Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties; 
c.  Ensure that any new wireless communications facilities are located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and 
d.  Ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service and promotes the provision and availability of communication services within the city. 
(2)  Applicability; preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this article shall be applicable to all wireless communications facilities existing or installed, built or modified after the effective date of this article to the fullest extent permitted by law. No provision of this article shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be unlawful under superseding federal or state law and furthermore, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is now or in the future superseded or preempted by state or federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law. 
(3)  General procedures. 
a.  Applications. Applications for permitted, administrative, or special uses pursuant to this article shall be subject to the supplementary procedures in this article. Applications shall be submitted to the city as a complete application on forms provided by the city.

(Ord. No. 11006,  II(Exh. A), 12-17-18) 
Sec. 30-82.1. - General requirements. 
    The requirements set forth in this article shall be applicable to all wireless communications facilities within the city installed, built, or modified after the effective date of this article to the full extent permitted by law. Such zoning review and approvals required in this article shall be in addition to any other generally applicable permitting requirement, including applicable building, excavation, or other right-of-way permits. 
(1)  Principal or incidental use. Towers may be either a principal or incidental use in institutional or nonresidential uses, subject to any applicable requirements herein and to any applicable requirement relating to yard or setback. An incidental use subject to a leasehold interest of a person other than the lot owner may be approved for a tower only if the leasehold area separately meets all requirements for a separate subdivided lot, including dedicated access, parking, setbacks, and lot size, applicable to a primary use in the district in which the use is proposed as if it was a separate subdivided lot. No other use shall allow towers unless required by law. All other wireless facilities other than towers, may be a principal or incidental use in all districts subject to the requirements herein. 
(2)  Building codes, safety standards, and zoning compliance. Wireless communications facilities shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with all standards contained in applicable state and local building codes. A certified engineer's structural report shall be required for all applications to construct a new or modify, or any way alter, a support structure, a utility pole, or antenna, including small wireless facility and fast-track, unless waived upon application to the director stating why such report is unnecessary to the specific application and a determination in the discretion of the director approving such statement. In addition to any other approvals required by this article, no wireless communication facility or portion thereof shall be erected, replaced, or expanded prior to receipt of a certificate of zoning compliance, unless otherwise required by law, and the issuance of a building permit. For all sites located within a historic preservation overlay district, a certificate of appropriateness shall also be required. For sites within city right-of-way: 
a.  The most restrictive adjacent underlying zoning district classification shall apply unless otherwise specifically zoned and designated on the official zoning map; 
b.  No application shall be submitted for permit approval without attaching the city's consent to use the right-of-way for the specific construction application, to the extent permitted by applicable law; 
c.  Wireless communications facilities shall be installed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on the right-of-way or obstruct the legal use of such right-of-way by authorities or authorized right-of-way users; and 
d.  Such use shall be required to obtain applicable permits and comply with the city's ROW management rules and regulations set forth in chapter 25. 
(3)  Regulatory compliance. All wireless communications facilities shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC, and any other local, state, or federal agency with the authority to regulate wireless communications facilities, and including all required licenses, permits, and taxes applicable to such structure and/or modification. Should such standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structures into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction, or modification of any wireless communications facilities permitted by this article shall be granted for any applicant having an uncured violation of this article, any zoning regulation regarding the lot on which the structure is proposed, or any other governmental regulatory, licensing, or tax requirement applicable to such wireless communications facilities within the city unless preempted by applicable law. 
(4)  Security. All wireless communications facilities shall be protected from unauthorized access by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any application to install, build, alter, or modify wireless communications facilities. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit as deemed necessary by the director or by the city council in the case of a special use permit. 
(5)  Lighting. Antenna, small wireless facilities, fast-track, and support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or other state or federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build, alter, or modify the antenna, small wireless facilities, fast-track, or support structure. Lighting may also be approved as a consistent component of a disguised support structure. Equipment cabinets and shelters may have lighting only as approved by the director or city council on the approved site plan. 
(6)  Advertising. Except for a disguised support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully permitted sign, the placement of advertising on wireless communications facilities is prohibited other than identification signage or required safety signage of not greater than one square foot on ground equipment. 
(7)  Design. 
a.  Color. Subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable state or federal agency, wireless communications facilities and attachments shall be painted a neutral color consistent with the natural or built environment of the site or an alternative painting scheme approved by the director, or the city council in the case of special use permits, consistent with the requirements of this article. Unpainted galvanized steel support structures are not permitted. 
b.  Ground equipment. When authorized, equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also comply with any design guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning district in which the facility is located. All equipment shall be either placed underground, contained in a single shelter or cabinet, or wholly concealed within a building or approved walled compound. 
c.  Antenna design. Antenna attached to a disguised support structure or tower shall be contained within the disguised support structure or within or mounted flush on the surface of the tower to which they are mounted. Antenna attached to an existing building, utility pole, or structure shall be of a color identical to the surface to which they are mounted. Antennas on the rooftop or attached to a building shall be screened or constructed and/or colored to match the structure to which they are attached. All antennas shall be designed to be disguised and maximally concealed on or within the support structure, or other structure. Exposed antenna on "crow's nest" or other visible platforms or extensions are prohibited. 
d.  Height. Support structures and antenna shall be no taller than necessary and shall not exceed the height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be adopted by the city or other regulatory agency. Support structures may exceed underlying zoning district height restrictions for buildings and structures only where shown to be necessary, provided that no reasonable alternative exists. To the extent permitted by applicable law, district height restrictions shall be considered by the city in determining the appropriateness of the design and location of the application under the applicable standards for approval. No support structure shall be approved at a height exceeding one hundred twenty (120) feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper function of the applicant's system. 
e.  Monopole design. All towers shall be of a monopole design. Lattice, guyed towers, or other non-monopole tower designs shall not be permitted. 
f.  Compound walls/landscaping. All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum of a six-foot high decorative wall constructed of brick, stone, or comparable masonry materials and a landscape strip of not less than ten (10) feet in width and planted with materials, which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six (6) feet. The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be approved by the director, or by the city council in the case of a special use permit, upon demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of visual screening will be achieved.

Each existing tree with a diameter of eight (8) inches or more, measured at four and one-half (4.5) feet above grade, that is removed shall be replaced with two (2) one-and-one-half-inch caliper large growing trees, measured one foot above grade. Trees that are determined to be unhealthy or are located where they could cause a safety hazard shall not be replaced. Any such replacement trees shall be required in addition to the landscaping design standards set forth in this UDO. 
b.  For each tree with a diameter of eight (8) inches or more that is retained on site, the developer shall be credited against the replacement required at a rate of two (2) trees per eight (8) inches of tree saved. Preserved trees shall be protected from construction damage with the erection of a fence at the drip line or further out, if possible. Protective fencing shall be removed only after all construction has been completed, including final grading. 
c.  If, through the development review process, the city determines that the site cannot accommodate the number of required replacement trees, the developer shall, prior to final occupancy, provide an equivalent fee-in-lieu of trees to a dedicated parks tree account. The fee per tree shall be posted in the city's schedule of fees. The fee-in-lieu shall be used for the future planting of trees in parks, rights-of-way, and public spaces, the location of which shall be determined by the director of parks and recreation. When a fee-in-lieu of trees provision exists and a variance is granted in accordance with section 30-21.11, the developer may receive a dollar-for-dollar credit for investment in public art in the City of Liberty when such art is deemed to be of public value by the arts commission and the city council. Aforementioned art may or may not be located on the development site.

(1)  Where any commercial, industrial, or multi-family development abuts a single or two-family residential development, a buffer shall be provided with sufficient plant material and/ or open space to reduce the impact of a high intensity use on adjacent residential property. Such buffer shall either be a one hundred-foot landscaped open space corridor or a fifty-foot open space corridor and an earthen berm landscaped with evergreens and trees. Exceptions to this requirement may be permitted for development within the CBD and MU districts or where unique conditions prevail. 
(2)  Wherever possible, buildings should be oriented so that utilitarian areas, such as loading and service areas, trash receptacles, off-street parking, and drive-thru service areas are de-emphasized, located at the rear of the building and away from other highly visible portions of the site or appropriately screened from view of adjacent properties or the public right-of-way. 
(3)  An enclosure or screen wall shall be designed and constructed in a manner that is complementary to the site and principal building. 
(4)  Permanent outdoor display structures shall be enclosed with materials compatible to the building architecture such as a decorative fence, wall, or other similar material. Limited visibility of the items displayed may be allowed at the city's discretion, where the location or merchandise does not detract from the overall appearance of the site. Merchandise displayed may not be stacked or situated to extend beyond the height of the enclosure. 
(5)  Rooftop equipment shall be properly screened from public view by architectural treatments that are compatible to the design of the building and integral to the overall design and appearance of the building. Screening shall be as high or higher than the equipment being screened. Exceptions to this provision may be allowed when equipment is located or a building is sited in a manner where the equipment is not visible from adjoining properties or public streets. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30-97.6. - Development and design standards, open space. 
    To ensure that new development occurs in a manner that maintains open areas free from structures and parking areas, sites shall be designed such that twenty (20) per cent of the total lot area shall remain as open space. Buffers, required above-ground detention, drainage basins and required yards may be used to calculate the required open space. Where appropriate, these areas shall be used as public gathering space and may include amenities such as benches, tables, chairs, and fountains.

(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05) 
Sec. 30.100. - Floodplain buffer. 
    It is the purpose of this section to regulate the floodplain area through provisions designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize losses due to flood hazards, which will: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that in times of flooding can cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities or can be dangerous to the public health, safety and welfare of the community; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Provide public information for evaluating land purchases that are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard; and 
(4)  Maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d). 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05; Ord. No. 10409,  I, 7-27-15) 
Sec. 30-100.1. - Flood losses. 
    The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation, which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development and obstructions in areas of flood hazard that cause increases in flood heights and velocities; 
(2)  The inadequate anchoring of obstructions that may cause damage to uses in other areas; and 
(3)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, that may be hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise inadequately protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05; Ord. No. 10409,  I, 7-27-15) 
Sec. 30-100.2. - Methods used to analyze flood hazards. 
    The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps: 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this UDO is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Clay County dated August 3, 2015 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the regulatory flood; 
(3)  Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point; 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height; 
(5)  Delineation of a flood fringe, the area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05; Ord. No. 10409,  I, 7-27-15) 
Sec. 30-100.3. - Floodplain buffer; general provisions. 
(1)  Applicability: This section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city, identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Clay County on map panels 29047C0139E, 29047C0144E, 29047C0145E, 29047C0165E, 29047C0226E, 29047C0227E, 29047C0228E, 29047C0229E, 29047C0231E, 29047C0232E, 29047C0233E, 29047C0234E, and 29047C0237E dated August 3, 2015 as amended, and any future revisions thereto, and within the buffers Floodway and Floodway F established in this section. In all areas covered by this section, no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restriction as the city may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in this section. 
(2)  Administration: The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this section. Duties of the city engineer shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Review all development permits to ensure that sites are reasonably safe from flooding and that the permit requirements of this section have been satisfied; 
b.  Review permits for proposed development to ensure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required; 
c.  Notify adjacent communities and the Flood Plain Management section of the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and shall submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); 
d.  Ensure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished; 
e.  Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures; 
f.  Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed; and 
g.  When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure the city engineer shall be presented certification from a registered professional engineer or architect. 
h.  Issue floodplain development permits for all approved applications. 
(3)  Rules for interpretation of buffer boundaries: The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe buffers shall be determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of a buffer, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the city engineer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the city council will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the buffer boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the buffer boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present technical evidence to council. 
(4)  Compliance: No development located within known flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. 
(5)  Abrogation: It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(6)  Interpretation: The provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(7)  Warning and disclaimer of liability: The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This section does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe buffer boundaries or land uses permitted within the buffers will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 30-100.7. - Floodway buffer. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-100.3 are areas designated as floodway buffer. Since the floodway buffer is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Permitted uses: Only uses having low flood damage potential and not obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the floodway buffer to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance. No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation. These uses are subject to the standards of this article. The following are permitted uses for the floodway buffer: 
a.  Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries, forestry; 
b.  Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas; 
c.  Nonresidential areas such as loading areas, parking, airport landing strips; and 
d.  Public and private recreational uses such as golf courses, archery ranges, picnic grounds, parks, wildlife and nature preserves. 
(2)  Prohibited uses: The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
a.  Any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  Any use that results in an increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 8804,  I, 4-11-05; Ord. No. 10409,  I, 7-27-15) 
Sec. 30-100.8. - Floodway fringe buffer. 
(1)  Permitted uses: Any use permitted in the floodway buffer shall also be permitted in the floodway fringe buffer. 
(2)  Standards for all new construction and substantial improvements to existing structures: the following standards shall apply: 
a.  The lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated to or above one foot above the base flood elevation; 
b.  For nonresidential structures, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated to or above one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood-proofed so that below that level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this section are satisfied; 
c.

(1)  Variance criteria: In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of zoning adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the following criteria: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
b.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
(2)  Conditions for approving floodplain buffer variances: 
a.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items b. through f. below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
b.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
c.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway buffer if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
d.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
e.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(a)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(b)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(c)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
f.  The city shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a city official that: 
(a)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
(b)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this section. 
(3)  Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures: 
a.  Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in part (2) and (3) of section 30-100.11 of this article. 
b.  In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet flood-proofed. 
(i)  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in flood-prone areas only. 
(ii)  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e. foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below highest adjacent grade, must be built with flood-resistant materials. 
(iii)  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with this ordinance. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
(iv)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above highest adjacent grade or flood-proofed so that they are contained within a watertight, flood-proofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with this section. 
(v)  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with the NFIP regulations. 
(vi)  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
(vii)  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
(viii)  The city shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a city official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below highest adjacent grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below highest adjacent grade increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this section. 
(ix)  Wet flood-proofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

The term includes repetitive loss buildings (see definition). 
For the purposes of this definition, "repair" is considered to occur when the first repair or reconstruction of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences. 
The term does not apply to: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure"; or, 
c.  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during a ten (10) year period, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the building.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 31-1. - Title. 
    These regulations shall hereafter be known, cited, and referred to as the "Stormwater Management Ordinance" of the City of Liberty, Missouri. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18) 
Sec. 31-2. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall extend and apply to all land within the corporate limits of the city. Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to construct buildings or develop land within the above-described area shall make application to the director of public works for approval of a stormwater management plan and issuance of a drainage permit as specified in this chapter. A drainage permit for projects including storm water quantity or storm water quality facilities can be granted by the director of public works only after the final stormwater management plan has been approved and all easements have been dedicated, accepted, and recorded, and all required maintenance assurances and required bonds have been executed. A drainage permit may be issued in the form of a storm permit or land disturbance permit. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18) 
Sec. 31-3. - Interpretations. 
    The provisions of this chapter are intended to supplement existing zoning and land use ordinances of the City of Liberty. In their interpretation and application, the provisions herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18) 
Sec. 31-4. - Objectives. 
(a)  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act ("Clean Water Act or CWA" Section 402 Public Law 92-500 as amended) established the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. The City of Liberty is required to and has taken actions to meet NPDES requirements and acquire a general operating permit. Whereas, one of the purposes of the stormwater management ordinance is to ensure the City of Liberty meets its duty to remain in compliance with NPDES requirements including improvement of the water quality of waterways by reducing the quantity of pollutants that stormwater picks up and carries into the storm sewer system during storm events. 
(b)  To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Liberty, this stormwater management ordinance is also enacted for the general purpose of assuring the proper balance between use of land and the preservation of a safe and beneficial environment. More specifically, the provisions of these regulations, as amended from time to time, we are intended to reduce property damage and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding and erosion of soil through the following: 
(1)  Establishment of a stormwater management system. 
(2)  Definition and establishment of stormwater management practice. 
(3)  Establishment of methods and guidelines for attenuating or avoiding flooding and erosion within the city from the cumulative effects of increased volume and peak discharge of surface water runoff. 
(4)  Establishment of methods and guidelines to minimize impacts to the ecology and water quality of the downstream system. 
(5)  Establishment of an appeals process to review decisions of the director of public works and to mediate disputes regarding the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18) 
Sec. 31-5. - Relationship to other laws. 
    These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm or corporation, by lawful action of the city, except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18) 
Sec. 31-6. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirements which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. Use of the requirements contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city, or its officers and employees, of the adequacy or safety or any stormwater management structure or use of land. Nor shall the approval of a stormwater management plan and the issuance of a drainage permit imply that land uses permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff. The degree of protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or stormwater runoff heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations therefore shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 10940,  IV, 7-30-18)
