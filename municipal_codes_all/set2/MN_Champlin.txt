PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Champlin, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through November 25, 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

(4)  Counseling, aiding or abetting a violation of this Code as defined above. 
(b)  In this section, the phrase "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty unless it is specifically provided that the failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days, or any combination thereof; provided, however, that if the violation is declared to be a petty misdemeanor the penalty shall be a fine not exceeding $300.00. In any case, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall pay the costs of prosecution. 
(d)  Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance: 
(1)  With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day that the violation continues is a separate offense; and 
(2)  With respect to violations that are not continuous with respect to time, each act is a separate offense. 
(e)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent suspension or revocation of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
(f)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief. 
State Law reference- Authorized penalty for ordinance violations, Minn. Stats. §§ 412.231, 609.0332, 609.034.

(Ord. No. 623, § 7-101, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 2-97. - Directive. 
    The city council shall adopt by resolution a comprehensive policy of personnel administration to be applicable to all employees of the city, which policy shall be consistent with good personnel administration practices, all state and federal laws, and with the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 623, § 7-102, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 2-98. - Definitions. 
(a)  The term "employee" or "employees," as used in this chapter only, refers to persons who have been hired as employees of the city, and does not apply to employees who have attained that status solely as a consequence of having been elected or appointed to the offices of mayor or councilmember. 
(b)  The term "employment," as used in this chapter, means employment by the city in positions other than mayor or councilmember. 
(Ord. No. 623, § 7-103, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 2-99. - Policy requirements; city council service. 
(a)  Personnel policy requirements. The personnel administration policy of the city shall include appropriate provisions to ensure that: 
(1)  Employment by the city is based on ability and fitness for the job, free of considerations of an employee or prospective employee's political or religious beliefs, gender, age, race, color, creed, national origin, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, sexual orientation or improper consideration of disability; 
(2)  Just and equitable incentives and conditions of employment are established and maintained to promote effectiveness and economy in the operation of the city government; 
(3)  Positions having the same duties and responsibilities are classified and compensated on a uniform basis; 
(4)  Good employee morale is promoted by considerations of the rights and interests of the public and city government; and 
(5)  Tenure of employees is subject to proper conduct, the satisfactory performance of work, the availability of work, and the availability of funds. 
(b)  Service on the city council. 
(1)  It is recognized that an employee's paid employment by the city that is contemporaneous with that employee's service as a member of the city council or as mayor of the city may be perceived by the public as inconsistent and incompatible with the legitimate and substantial interests of the residents of the city in at least the following respects: 
a.  Such contemporaneous employment and service as a councilmember or as mayor creates an appearance of direct and indirect pecuniary conflict; 
b.  Such employment and council or mayoral service creates an appearance on the part of the public, the employee's supervisors and other city employees of the exercise or assertion of control over the employee's supervisors and managers; 
c.  Such employment and council or mayoral service inevitably results, from time to time, in conflicts of interest or appearances of conflict on matters which come before the council, such as the negotiation and approval of labor union contracts, the selection, hiring and termination of supervisors or other employees who may have some influence or control over the councilmember/employee's duties, working conditions or compensation as an employee of the city, or the hiring, promotion or termination of other employees who may have directly or indirectly assisted the mayor or councilmember/employee in his campaign for election. These and other situations result in conflicts or appearances of conflicts of interest that may require a mayor or councilmember who is also an employee to not take part in council decisions. To the extent that a mayor or councilmember does not participate in the decisions of the council, or in other functions normally incident to the office, the member's constituents are deprived of representation in such matters; 
d.  No employee shall serve as mayor or as a member of the city council without first resigning his employment with the city; and 
e.  No former mayor or former member of the city council shall be eligible for paid employment by the city until one year has elapsed from the expiration of service as councilmember or mayor. 
Subsections (b)(1)d and (b)(1)e of this section shall not apply to any employee who may be serving as mayor or as a member of the city council at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived for the balance of the member's then current term or any consecutive term thereafter. 
(2)  The personnel administration policy shall include a statement which adopts the specific language of subsection (b)(1) of this section. The failure, however, of the council to include such language in the personnel administration policy shall not invalidate the requirements set forth in those provisions.

An application to transfer a license shall be treated the same as an application for a new license, and all of the provisions of this Code applying to applications for a license shall apply. 
( Ord. No. 775 , 11-28-2016)

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 30-194. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to prohibit massage businesses and services to the public except those licensed as therapeutic massage establishment and massage therapists pursuant to this article. The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to prevent criminal activity and to protect the health and welfare of the community. The purpose of this article is not intended to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or expression. 
( Ord. No. 808 , 1-28-2019) 
Sec. 30-195. - Findings of the city council. 
    The City Council of the City of Champlin makes the following findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services to the public: 
(1)  Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to the general public. 
(2)  Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation. 
(3)  Limiting the number of therapeutic massage enterprise licenses and license qualifications for the restrictions on therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk that such businesses and persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the community. 
(4)  Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and standardized training in massage can endanger citizens by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury. 
(5)  Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax city law enforcement services because such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by persons with standardized training. 
(6)  The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(7)  Premises where prior massage therapists have had their licenses revoked require a period of time where massage services should not be provided in order to avoid continuation of the same clientele and association of the location with unlawful services.

Sec. 35-10. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of the facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
(7)  If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 653, 1-14-2008) 
Sec. 35-13. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(Ord. No. 653, 1-14-2008) 
Sec. 35-16. - Cost of abatement of the violation.

(2)  Submit to the city a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its equipment to the city. If a registrant proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option: 
a.  Purchase the equipment; 
b.  Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove it; or 
c.  Require the registrant to post an additional bond or an increased bond amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the equipment. 
(b)  Equipment of a registrant that fails to comply with the preceding subsection and which, for two years, remains unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Abating the nuisance; 
(2)  Taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a useable condition; 
(3)  Requiring removal of the equipment by the registrant or by the registrant's surety; or 
(4)  Exercising its rights pursuant to the performance and restoration bond. 
(c)  Any registrant who has unusable equipment in any right-of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation, unless this requirement is waived by the city. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1532) 
Sec. 50-98. - Reservation of regulatory and police powers. 
(a)  The city, by the granting of a right-of-way permit, or by registering a person under this article, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the constitution and statutes of the state or the ordinance of the city to regulate the use of the right-of-way by the permittee; and the permittee by its acceptance of a right-of-way permit or of registration under those ordinances agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A permittee or registrant is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. 
(b)  Any conflict between the provisions of a registration or of a right-of-way permit and any other present or future exercise of the city's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1533) 
Sec. 50-99. - Severability. 
(a)  If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
(b)  If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, nonappealable order that any permit, right or registration issued under this article or any portion of this article is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit, right or registration granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a permit, right or registration shall be considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must acknowledge the authority of the city council to issue such revocable permit and the power to revoke it. 
(c)  Nothing in this article precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1534) 
Sec. 50-100. - Nonexclusive remedy. 
    The remedies provided in this article and other ordinances of the city are not exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the city may have at law or in equity. The city is hereby authorized to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the public rights-of-way, including damages to the rights-of-way, whether or not caused by a violation of any of the provisions of this article or other provisions of the city.

Secs. 50-101-50-128. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - PERMIT 

Sec. 50-129. - Required. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided for in this article, no person may obstruct or excavate any right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit from the city to do so. 
(1)  Excavation permit. An excavation permit is required to allow the holder to excavate that part of the right-of-way described in such permit and/or to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing equipment described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified therein. 
(2)  Obstruction permit. An obstruction permit is required to allow the holder to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing equipment, vehicles, or other obstructions described therein on the right-of-way for the duration specified therein. An obstruction permit is not required if a person already possesses a valid excavation permit for the same project. 
(b)  No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way beyond the date or dates specified in the permit unless a new permit or permit extension is granted. 
(c)  In accordance with Minnesota Public Utility Commission Rules, part 7819.1000, subd. 3, and notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for unreasonable delays in right-of-way excavation, obstruction, patching or restoration. The delay penalty shall be established from time to time by city council resolution. 
(d)  Permits issued under this article shall be conspicuously displayed at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the city inspector and authorized city personnel. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1509) 
Sec. 50-130. - Applications. 
(a)  Application for a permit shall be made to the city. Right-of-way permit applications shall contain, and will be considered complete only upon compliance with the requirements of the following provisions:

(2)  Submission of a completed permit application form, including all required attachments, and scaled drawings showing the location and area of the proposed project and the location of all existing and proposed equipment; 
(3)  Payment of all money due to the city for: 
a.  Permit fees and costs due; 
b.  Prior obstructions or excavations; 
c.  Any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the city as a result of prior excavations or obstructions of the rights-of-way of any emergency actions taken by the city; and 
d.  Franchise fees, if applicable. 
(4)  Payment of disputed amounts due the city by posting security or depositing in an escrow account an amount equal to at least 110 percent of the amount owing. 
(b)  When an excavation permit is requested for purposes of installing additional equipment, and a performance and restoration bond which in existence is insufficient with respect to the additional equipment in the sole determination of the city, the permit applicant may be required by the city to post an additional performance and restoration bond in accordance with this article. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1510) 
Sec. 50-131. - Issuance; conditions. 
(a)  If the city determines that the applicant has satisfied the requirements of this division, the city may issue a permit. 
(b)  The city may impose any reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a permit and the performance of the applicant thereunder in order to: 
(1)  Protect the public health, safety and welfare; 
(2)  Ensure the structural integrity of the right-of-way; 
(3)  Protect the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way; 
(4)  Minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public; and 
(5)  Otherwise efficiently manage the use of the right-of-way. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1511) 
Sec. 50-132. - Fees. 
(a)  Registration fee. The registration fee shall be established to recover the cost of administration, review and recording of the permit. 
(b)  Excavation permit fee. The excavation permit fee shall be established by the city in an amount as set forth in chapter 22, sufficient to recover the following costs: 
(1)  The city cost; 
(2)  The degradation of the right-of-way that will result from the excavation; and 
(3)  Restoration, if done or caused to be done by the city. 
(c)  Obstruction permit fee. The obstruction permit fee shall be established by the city and shall be in an amount as set forth in chapter 22, sufficient to recover the city cost including, but not limited to; administration, plan review, recording of permit, map review, testing result review and inspection. 
(d)  Disruption fees. The city may establish and impose a disruption fee, as set forth in chapter 22, as a penalty for unreasonable delays in excavations, obstructions, or restoration. Disruption fees will not be imposed if the delay in completion is due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, including without limitation, inclement weather, acts of God or civil strife. 
(e)  Payment of permit fees. No excavation permit or obstruction permit shall be issued without payment of all fees required prior to the issuance of such a permit unless the applicant shall agree (in a manner, amount, and substance acceptable to the city) to pay such fees within 30 days of billing therefore. All permit fees shall be doubled during a probationary period. Permit fees that were paid for a permit revoked for a breach are not refundable. Any refunded permit fees shall be less all city costs up to and including the date of refund. 
(f)  Use of permit fees. All obstruction and excavation permit fees shall be used solely for city management, construction, maintenance and restoration costs of the right-of-way. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1512) 
Sec. 50-133. - Right-of-way restoration. 
(a)  The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration and the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable, all in the sole determination of the city. In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed before the commencement of the work and must inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 36 months thereafter. 
(b)  In its application for an excavation permit, the permittee may choose to have the city restore the right-of-way. In any event, the city may determine to perform the right-of-way restoration and shall require the permittee to pay a restoration fee, as set forth in chapter 22, to provide for reimbursement of all costs associated with such restoration. In the event the permittee elects not to perform restoration, the city may, in lieu of performing the restoration itself, impose a fee to fully compensate for the resultant degradation as well as for any and all additional city costs associated therewith. Such fee for degradation shall compensate the city for costs associated with a decrease in the useful life of the right-of-way caused by excavation and shall include a restoration fee component. Payment of such fee does not relieve the permittee from any restoration obligation, including, but not limited to, replacing and compacting the subgrade base material and the excavation. The restoration fee will not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities. 
(1)  City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, during the 36 months following such restoration, the right-of-way settles due to the permittee's excavation or restoration, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of repairing said right-of-way. 
(2)  Permittee restoration. If the permittee chooses at the time of application for an excavation permit to restore the right-of-way itself, such permittee shall post an additional performance and restoration bond in an amount determined by the city to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the right-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. If, 24 months after completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the city determines that the right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance and restoration bond posted shall be released. 
(3)  Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee, as set forth in chapter 22. However, the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities. 
(c)  The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and in compliance with Minnesota Public Utility Commission rule 7819.1100. The city shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent to the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The city, in exercising this authority, shall be guided but not limited by the following standards and considerations: 
(1)  The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; 
(2)  The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; 
(3)  The character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; 
(4)  The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; 
(5)  The remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; 
(6)  Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and 
(7)  The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum limits of restoration methods and area requirements the city will impose are found in plates 1 to 13 shown in Minnesota Public Utility Commission Rules, parts 7819.9900 to 7819.9950. 
(d)  By choosing to restore the right-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 24 months following its completion. During this 24-month period it shall, upon notification from the city, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable, all in the sole determination of the city. 
(e)  If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city at its option may perform or cause to be performed such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay as required in this subsection, the city may exercise its rights under the performance and restoration bond. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1513) 
Sec. 50-134. - Joint applications. 
(a)  Registrants may jointly make application for permits to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time. 
(b)  Registrants who join in and during a scheduled obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee but a permit would still be required. 
(c)  Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation, which is not performed by the city, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1514) 
Sec. 50-135. - Supplementary applications. 
(a)  A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may perform any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee, who determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated, before working in that greater area, must: 
(1)  Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees necessitated; and 
(2)  Be granted a new permit or permit extension. 
(b)  A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, he must make application for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. The supplementary application must be done before the permit end date. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1515) 
Sec. 50-136. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, franchises or other authorizations and to pay all fees required by the city, any other city, county, state or federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including Minn. Stats. §§ 216D.01-216D.09 (One Call Excavation Notice System). A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. 
(b)  Except in the case of an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. 
(c)  A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles may not be parked with or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1516) 
Sec. 50-137. - Denial. 
    The city may, in accordance with Minn. Stats. § 237.163, subd. 4, deny any application for a permit as provided in this article. 
(1)  Mandatory denial. Except in the case of an emergency, no right-of-way permit will be granted: 
a.  To any person required by section 50-84 to be registered who has not done so; 
b.  To any person required by section 50-88 to file an annual report but has failed to do so; 
c.  For any next-year project not listed in the construction and major maintenance plan required under section 50-88 unless the person used reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for the project; 
d.  For any project that requires the excavation of any portion of a right-of-way that was constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five years; 
e.  To any person who has failed within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with the requirements of this article; 
f.  To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a permit under section 50-141; or 
g.  If, in the sole discretion of the city, the issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The city, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Permissive denial. The city may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to protect interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users. The city may also consider one or more of the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; 
b.  The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; 
c.  The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the equipment of the permit applicant; 
d.  The applicability of this article or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect location of equipment in the right-of-way; 
e.  The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise; if any, this article, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; 
f.  The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way; 
g.  The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction; or 
h.  The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way. 
(3)  Discretionary issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, where the permit applicant did not have knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project when said applicant was required to submit its list of next-year projects, the city may issue a permit in any case where the permit is necessary to: 
a.  Prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permit applicant; 
b.  Allow such customer to materially improve its utility service; or 
c.  Allow a new economic development project. 
(4)  Permits for additional next-year projects. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1)-(3) of this section, the city may issue a permit to a registrant who was allowed under section 50-88(b) to submit an additional next-year project, or in the event the registrant demonstrates that it used commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for the project, such permit to be subject to all other conditions and requirements of law, including such conditions as may be imposed under section 50-131(b). 
(Code 1977, § 15-1517) 
Sec. 50-138. - Inspection. 
(a)  When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the permittee shall notify the city. 
(b)  The permittee shall make the work site available to the city inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of work. 
(c)  At the time of inspection the city inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well being of the public. The city inspector may issue an order to the registrant for any work that does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order, the registrant shall present proof to the city that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the city may revoke the permit pursuant to section 50-141. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1519) 
Sec. 50-139. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the city, or the city's designee, of any event regarding its equipment that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for the actions it took in response to the emergency. In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's equipment, the city may attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose equipment occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Nonemergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or evacuates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by city ordinance, including, but not limited to, criminal fines and penalties, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this article. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1520) 
Sec. 50-140. - Supplementary notification. 
    If the obstruction or evacuation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as the information is known. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1521) 
Sec. 50-141. - Revocation. 
(a)  Registrants hold permits issued pursuant to this article as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves its right, as provided herein and in accordance with Minn. Stats. § 237.163, subd. 4, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. A substantial breach by the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance; 
(5)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or 
(6)  The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 50-138(c). 
(b)  If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at the city's discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. 
(c)  Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall contact the city with a plan, acceptable to the city inspector, for its correction. The permittee's failure to so contact the city inspector, the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee's failure to so contact the city inspector, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit that, if breached, will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on rights-of-way outside of the permit. 
(e)  If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined above, the permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(f)  If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with such revocation. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1522) 
Sec. 50-142. - Appeals. 
(a)  A person may have a denial, revocation, or fee imposition reviewed by the city council, upon written request, if he: 
(1)  Has been denied registration; 
(2)  Has been denied a right-of-way permit; 
(3)  Has had its right-of-way permit revoked; or 
(4)  Believes that the fees imposed on the user by the city do not conform to the requirements of law. 
(b)  The city council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the city council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision. 
(c)  Upon affirmation by the city council of the denial, revocation, or fee imposition, the right-of-way user shall have the right to have the matter resolved by binding arbitration. Binding arbitration must be before an arbitrator agreed to by both the city and the person. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the matter must be resolved by a three-person arbitration panel made up of one arbitrator selected by the city, one arbitrator selected by the person, and one arbitrator selected by the other two arbitrators. The costs and fees of a single arbitrator shall be borne equally by the city and the person. In the event there is a third arbitrator, each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the expense of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration. 
(d)  Each party to the arbitration shall pay its own costs, disbursements, and attorney fees. 
(Code 1977, § 15-1523) 
Sec. 50-143. - Mapping data. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, each registrant shall provide, as a part of its permit application, the following information: 
(1)  The location and approximate depth of the applicant's mains, cables, conduits, switches, and related equipment and facilities with the location based on: 
a.  Offsets from the property lines, distances from the centerline to the public right-of-way, and curblines as determined by the city; 
b.  Coordinates derived from the coordinates system being used by the city; or 
c.  Any other system agreed upon by the applicant and the city. 
(2)  The type and size of the utility facility;

(4)  A legend explaining symbols, characters, abbreviations, scale and other data shown on the map; 
(5)  Any facilities to be abandoned, if applicable, in conformance with Minn. Stats. § 216D.04, subd. 3; and 
(6)  Mapping data shall be provided by the applicant with specificity and in the format requested by the city for inclusion in the mapping system used by the city. If such format is different from what is currently utilized and maintained by the registration, the registrant may provide such information in the format that they currently are utilizing. The permit application fee may include the cost to convert the data furnished by the applicant to a format currently in use by the city. 
(b)  Information regarding equipment of telecommunications right-of-way users constructed or located prior to May 10, 1997, need only be supplied in the form maintained, however, all telecommunications right-of-way users must submit some type of documentary evidence regarding the location of equipment within the rights-of-way of the city. 
(c)  At the request of any registrant, any information requested by the city, which qualifies as a "trade-secret" under Minn. Stats. § 13.37(b), shall be treated as trade secret information as detailed therein. With respect to the provision of mapping data, the city may consider unique circumstances from time to time required to obtain mapping data.

(a)  Approved types of house service connections shall be one of the following: 
(1)  Type 1. Connections to existing vitrified clay wye branches shall be made with an approved type of joint material of the bituminous type or an approved compression coupling. The connection shall be completely watertight. No connection shall be allowed to a damaged wye branch. If damage occurs during the making of the connection, the wye branch shall be taken out of the main sewer by the plumber and replaced either by another undamaged wye or by a straight vitrified clay pipe. If a straight pipe is used in the replacement, other approved connection methods shall be used. Concrete encasement of the wye branch, connection joint, or any other part of the connection shall not be deemed watertight and shall not be allowed as a method or repairing a damaged joint. 
(2)  Type 2. Connections of the saddle type shall be made in a smooth, round hole, machine drilled into the main sewer pipe. The fittings used in the connection shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that no protrusion of the fitting into the main sewer pipe shall result. The connector shall fit perfectly the contour of the inside of the sanitary sewer and shall be specifically designed to fit the particular size main sewer pipe into which the connection is made. The machine-drilled hole shall be of such size to provide one-eighth-inch clearance between the outside of the fitting and the hole. The space thus provided shall be completely filled with joint material. The space between the shoulder of the fittings and the face of the main sewer pipe shall be one-eighth-inch thick and this space shall be completely filled with joint material. The joint material used for the type 2 house service connection shall be completely waterproof and shall be capable of withstanding any condition of stress or strain likely to be encountered in normal sanitary sewer construction or maintenance. Concrete encasement will not be considered waterproof. The fitting shall be manufactured of either cast aluminum alloy or vitrified clay pipe and shall be capable of receiving all normally used types of pipe for house service connections. 
(b)  Type 1 wye connections may be used in existing sanitary sewers when wye branches previously installed are readily and conveniently available. If existing wye branches cannot be found after diligent search or are not located properly for providing the needed service, type 2 saddle connections shall be made; provided the inspector approves.

DIVISION 2. - STRENGTH CHARGES 

Sec. 58-236. - Recitals. 
    The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state (the "commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations thereunder (the "Act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the metropolitan disposal system (as defined in Minn. Stats. § 473.121, subd. 24) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. Furthermore, Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served.

ARTICLE VI. - VACANT BUILDING REGISTRATION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 734, adopted Dec. 9, 2013 , amended VI to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, §§ 106-84-106-93, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 719, adopted Dec. 12, 2011. 

Sec. 106-84. - Purpose and findings. 
    The City of Champlin is enacting this section to help protect the public health, safety and welfare by establishing a program for the identification and regulation of vacant buildings. The city finds that vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in residential and non-residential neighborhoods. Neglect of vacant buildings, as well as use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals creates a risk of fire, explosion or flooding for the vacant building and adjacent properties. There is a substantial cost to the city for monitoring vacant buildings. This cost should not be borne by the general taxpayers of the community; but, rather, these costs should be borne by owners of those buildings.

Chapter 114 - FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS 

Sec. 114-1. - Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purpose. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has, in Minn. Stats. ch. 103F and Minn. Stats. § 462.357, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards that is consistent with the standards established by the state department of natural resources. 
(3)  This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(Code 1977, § 13-113.1; Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004; Ord. No. 772 , 10-24-2016)) 
Sec. 114-2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts. 
(1)  Where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in sections 114-5 or 114-6 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 
(2)  Locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district. Within the general floodplain district, the floodway district standards in section 114-5 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, the flood fringe district standards in section 114-6 may apply outside the floodway. 
(3)  The floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements. In the case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards apply. 
(b)  Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this chapter. The attached material includes: the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016; the flood insurance rate map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016; and the letter of map revision, Case No. 17-05-3893P, with an effective date of February 16, 2018, including all attached maps, tables, and flood profiles; all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the office of the community development department and city clerk. 
Effective flood insurance rate map panels: 
27053C0058F  27053C0069F 
27053C0059F  27053C0086F 
27053C0066F  27053C0087F 
27053C0067F  27053C0088F 
27053C0068F  27053C0089F 
(c)  Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than two feet above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(d)  Interpretation. 
(1)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(2)  The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distance on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator, the board of adjustments (planning commission) shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding the interpretation. The city council shall make the final ruling on the interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case and to submit technical evidence. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(f)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(g)  Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in full force. 
(Code 1977, § 13-113.2; Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004; Ord. No. 772 , 10-24-2016; Ord. No. 795 , 4-9-2018) 
Sec. 114-3. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
    Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
    Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 
(1)  Certain conditions as detailed in chapter 126, pertaining to zoning regulations, exist; and 
(2)  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
    Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
    Flood frequency means the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota. 
    Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse that has been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood. 
    Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
    Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain, which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided . 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
    New construction means structures, including additions and improvements, and placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance. 
    Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
    Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
    Reach means the hydraulic engineering term used to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "recreational vehicle" shall be synonymous with the term "travel trailer/travel vehicle." 
    Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. The term "regional flood" is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation means an elevation no lower than two feet above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
    Special flood hazard area is a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with "one hundred year floodplain." 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit's expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means, within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure; provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. For the purpose of this chapter, the term "historic structure" shall be as defined in 44 CFR 59.1. 
    Variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this chapter to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation. 
(Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004; Ord. No. 772 , 10-24-2016) 
Sec. 114-4. - Establishment of zoning districts. 
(a)  Districts. 
(1)  Floodway district. The floodway district shall include those areas within zones AE designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 114-2(b). For lakes, wetlands and other basins within zones AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the floodway district also includes those areas that are at or below the ordinary high water level as defined in Minn. Stats. § 103G.005, subd. 14. 
(2)  Flood fringe district. The flood fringe district shall include those areas within zones AE that have a floodway delineated on the flood insurance rate map, but are located outside of the floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins within zones AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the flood fringe district also includes those areas below the one percent change (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minn. Stats. § 103G.005, subd. 14. 
(3)  General floodplain district. The general floodplain district shall include those areas designated as zone A or zone AH without a floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 114-2(b). 
(b)  Compliance. Within the floodplain districts established in this ordinance, the use, size, type and location of development must comply with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. In no cases shall floodplain development adversely affect the efficiency or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Within the floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in sections 114-5 and 114-6 that follow, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that: 
(1)  New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this chapter and specifically section 114-10; 
(2)  Modifications, additions, structural alterations or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this chapter and specifically section 114-12; and 
(3)  As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by ground surveys and floodproofing techniques must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of this chapter and specifically as stated in section 114-11(d)(6)e. 
(Code 1977, § 13-113.3; Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004; Ord. No. 772 , 10-24-2016) 
Sec. 114-5. - Floodway district (FW). 
(a)  The following are permitted uses in the floodway district: 
(1)  General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting; 
(2)  Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas, and airport landing strips; 
(3)  Private and public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, and single or multiple purpose recreational trails; and 
(4)  Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas. 
(5)  Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and pipelines, provided that the department of natural resources' area hydrologist is notified at least ten days prior to issuance of any permit. 
(b)  The following are standards for floodway permitted uses: 
(1)  The use shall have a low flood damage potential; 
(2)  The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists; and 
(3)  The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment. 
(c)  The following are conditional uses within the floodway district: 
(1)  Structures accessory to the uses listed in subsection (a) of this section and the uses listed in subsections (c)(2)-(c)(8) of this section; 
(2)  Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials; 
(3)  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures; 
(4)  Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials; 
(5)  Placement of fill or construction of fences; 
(6)  Travel trailers and travel vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of section 114-10(c); 
(7)  Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of section 114-10; and 
(8)  Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequent flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
(d)  The following are standards for floodway conditional uses: 
(1)  No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected; 
(2)  All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in section 114-11(d); 
(3)  The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists; 
(4)  The following provisions relating to fill: 
a.  Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable methods; 
b.  Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan; and 
c.  As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (d)(4)b of this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the city council has received an appropriate plan which ensures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the office of the county recorder. 
(5)  The following provisions relating to accessory structures: 
a.  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation; 
b.  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters. 
1.  Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
2.  So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
c.  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 of FP-4 floodproofing classification in the state building code; provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 576 square feet in size, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards, as appropriate: 
1.  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 
2.  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and 
3.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(6)  The following provisions relating to the storage of materials and equipment: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited; and 
b.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
(7)  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. ch. 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway; and 
(8)  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
(Code 1977, § 13-113.4; Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004; Ord. No. 772 , 10-24-2016) 
Sec. 114-6. - Flood fringe district (FF). 
(a)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district. If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the flood fringe; provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe permitted uses listed in subsection (b) of this section and the standards for all flood fringe uses listed in subsection (e) of this section. 
(b)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses. 
(1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including the basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
(2)  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 576 square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be internally floodproofed in accordance with section 114-6(d)(5)c. 
(3)  The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(4)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(5)  The provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall apply. 
(c)  Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and section 114-11(d) 
(d)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
(1)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or truck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 
a.  The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 
b.  It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 
c.  It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 
The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding; and 
2.  Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or truck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(i)  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. When openings are placed in a structure's walls to provide for entry of floodwaters to equalize pressures, the bottom of all openings shall not be higher than one-foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
(ii)  The enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
(2)  Basements, as defined by section 114-3, shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation; and 
b.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation; provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with this chapter. 
(3)  All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
(4)  When at any one time more than 150 cubic yards of soil or other similar material is excavated or filled on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(5)  Regulation of the storage of materials and equipment shall be as follows: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited; and 
b.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
(6)  The provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall also apply. 
(e)  Standards for all flood fringe uses. 
(1)  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the board of adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
(2)  Commercial uses and accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
(3)  For manufacturing and industrial uses measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in subsection (e)(2) of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
(4)  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable methods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(5)  Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
(6)  Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in section 114-10(c). 
(7)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Sec. 114-7. - General floodplain district. 
(a)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  The uses listed in section 114-5(a) shall be permitted uses. 
(2)  All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Section 114-5 shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway district and section 114-6 shall apply if the proposed use in the flood fringe district. 
(b)  Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations within the general floodplain district. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway or flood fringe district: 
(1)  A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information; 
(2)  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets; 
(3)  Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types; and 
(4)  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
(c)  Determination by designated engineer or expert. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe district and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 CFR 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall: 
(1)  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood; 
(2)  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and 
(3)  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 feet. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 feet shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increase flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(d)  Presentation of technical evaluation by zoning administrator; acceptance or denial by city council. The zoning administrator shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the city council. The city council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary or deny the permit application. The city council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the department of natural resources or the planning commission for review and comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the city council shall refer the matter back to the zoning administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 114-5 and 114-6.

Sec. 114-8. - Land development standards. 
(a)  Subdivisions. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall contain a building site at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents. 
(b)  Floodway/flood fringe determinations in the general floodplain district. In the general floodplain district, applicants shall provide the information required in section 114-7 to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site. 
(c)  Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(d)  Building sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements must be: 
(1)  Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; 
(2)  Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;

Sec. 118-1. - Purpose, intent and findings. 
(a)  This chapter is established to protect and promote the health, safety, general welfare and order within the city through the establishment of a comprehensive and impartial series of standards, regulations and procedures governing the type, numbers, size, structure, location, height, lighting, erection, maintenance, use and/or display of devices, signs or symbols serving as a visual communicative media to persons situated within or upon public rights-of-way or properties. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are intended to establish an opportunity for effective communication, and a sense of concern for visual amenities on the part of those designing, displaying or otherwise utilizing needed communicative media of the types regulated by this chapter; while at the same time, assuring that the public is not endangered, annoyed or distracted by the unsafe, disorderly, indiscriminate or unnecessary use of such communicative media. 
(c)  It is not the purpose or intent of this sign ordinance to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent to regulate any building design or display not defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building. 
(d)  The city finds it is necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public health, safety, welfare and aesthetics of the community that the construction, location, size and maintenance of signs be controlled. Further, the city finds: 
(1)  Permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on the image of the community; 
(2)  An opportunity for viable identification of community businesses and institutions must be established; 
(3)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly temporary signs commonly located within or adjacent to public right-of-way, result in roadside clutter and obstruction of views of oncoming traffic; 
(4)  The right to express noncommercial opinions in any zoning district must be protected, subject to reasonable restrictions on size, height, location and number; 
(5)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs adversely impact the image and aesthetic attractiveness of the community and thereby undermine economic value and growth.

Sec. 122-5. - Park dedication. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city that the character and quality of the environment be considered to be of major importance in the planning and development of the city. In this regard, the manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority. The preservation of land for public use as parks, recreational facilities as described in Minn. Stats. § 471.191, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, and public open spaces within the city are essential for the maintenance of a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city. The city must not only provide these amenities for its present citizens, but it must also provide for the future. It is recognized by the city council that the need for such parks, facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, and public open spaces is directly related to the density and intensity of population and development permitted and allowed within the city. Urban development results in increased population, increased intensity of use of and greater demands for such public areas and facilities. Disregard of this principle would result in deterioration of such spaces and facilities and would diminish the quality of the environment for all. 
(b)  Park dedication requirements. The approval of all applications for every new development, subdivision of land, lot split or planned unit development in the city shall be conditioned on the dedication to the public by the applicant, or owner of the land to be developed if different from the applicant, of a reasonable portion of the proposed development, subdivision, lot split or planned unit development or, at the discretion of the city council, an equivalent amount in cash for part or all of the portion to be dedicated, for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, recreational facilities as defined and outlined in Minn. Stats. § 471.191, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, and public open spaces. It is the policy of the city that the amount of land or cash to be dedicated or paid to the public pursuant to this section shall be related to the anticipated population density and intensity of use of such public areas and facilities resulting from each new development, subdivision, lot split or planned unit development, and on the impact on use and demand for use of such facilities in the city. Such requirements shall hereinafter be referred to as the park dedication requirements. 
(c)  Required for final approval. Applicants for the development, lot split or subdivision of residential, commercial, and industrial land, or the owners of the land, shall satisfy the park dedication requirements by conveyance of the land to be dedicated and payment of the cash equivalency required by this chapter to the city before final approval of the application, in accordance with the standards set forth herein. In the case of an application for approval of a split of an existing lot, the calculation of the park dedication requirements shall be the size of the original lot, before the split, unless a park dedication requirement had been imposed and paid previously on the original lot. If the lot had previously been subject to a park dedication requirement, then the park dedication requirement under subsection (b) of this section shall be calculated on the size of the newly created lot. 
(d)  Standards. The following standards shall be applied to determine the park dedication requirements applicable to each application for development, lot split or subdivision of residential, commercial and industrial property in the city. 
(1)  Final plat approval of every development or subdivision in the city for residential, commercial, industrial or other uses, every lot split and every planned unit development which includes residential, commercial and industrial uses, or any combination thereof, shall be subject to the park dedication requirements set for below: 
a.  With regard to property to be developed for commercial uses which is to be approved for commercial uses, 7.5 percent of the total area within the subdivision, lot to be split or plat, including outlots and all areas to be dedicated to the public for other public purposes, shall be dedicated to the public for park purposes, or its equivalent value in cash shall be paid to the city; 
b.  With regard to property to be developed for industrial uses, 7.5 percent of the total area within the subdivision, lot to be split or plat, including outlots and all other areas to be dedicated to the public for other public purposes, which is to be approved for industrial uses shall be dedicated to the public for park purposes, or its equivalent value in cash shall be paid to the city; 
c.  Residential uses within the subdivision, lot to be split or plat shall be subject to park dedication requirements at the rate of .04 acres per housing unit; and 
d.  In the event that the development, subdivision, lot to be split or planned unit development is a mixed-use development, the park dedication requirements set forth herein shall apply in proportion to the various uses within the subdivision, lot to be split or plat. 
e.  Existing homes in a land subdivision without proof of paid park dedication shall pay one-half of the current park dedication fee. 
(2)  For all projects in which all or part of the park dedication requirements are to be satisfied by a cash equivalency payment and which are to receive final city council approval before an adjusted schedule is adopted by the council pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section, the cash payment shall be as set forth in chapter 22. For all such projects that are to receive final approval after such adjustment the applicant or owner shall satisfy the cash requirements in accordance with the schedule in effect at the time of the final approval. 
(3)  The city council shall, not sooner than one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and thereafter as land values within the city change, but not more frequently than annually, review the cash equivalency requirements stated herein. If, in the discretion of the council, with the advice of the city assessor, such values have changed sufficiently to justify a change in the schedule to maintain a reasonable equivalency to the fair market value of similar property in the city, the council may, by resolution, adopt a cash payment schedule to reflect such changes so that the cash equivalency payments made in lieu of the dedication of land shall approximate the fair market value of the land that would be dedicated if cash was not required. 
(e)  Use of cash equivalence. All cash equivalency payments made to satisfy the park dedication requirements shall be placed in a special fund by the city and used only for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, recreational facilities as described in Minn. Stats. § 471.191, playgrounds, trails or open space. 
(f)  Determination of the land to be dedicated. The park and recreation commission shall, prior to the time that the planning commission completes its public hearings on the preliminary plat, review the preliminary plat and recommend to the planning commission the total area and location of the land the park and recreation commission determines should be dedicated for park use. Such recommendations shall not be binding. In those instances where the park and recreation commission concludes that a cash equivalency payment should be made by the applicant or owner in lieu of dedication of land, the park and recreation commission shall recommend to the planning commission the percentage of the total park dedication requirement to be paid to the city in cash. In the event that review at a regular meeting of the park and recreation commission would result in a delay in the review and approval process so that the time limitations of Minn. Stats. § 462.358 may not be met, the requirement of review by the park and recreation commission may be waived by either the applicant or by the city council at the time of its review of the application. 
(g)  Dedicated land not to be included in density calculations. Land dedicated to satisfy the park dedication requirements of this section shall be included in the area of the subdivision, lot to be split or plat for purposes of calculating the density requirements of the development as set out in chapter 126, pertaining to zoning regulations. 
(h)  Standards for accepting dedication of land for public purposes. In addition to all other requirements of this chapter, all land to be dedicated to satisfy the park dedication requirements shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  It shall meet the needs of the city as identified in the park systems plan, comprehensive plan or trails plan; 
(2)  The applicant shall, prior to final plat approval, deliver to the city attorney an abstract of title or registered property abstract for all land to be dedicated, evidencing good marketable title without liens or encumbrances of any kind. It shall have a marketable title, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances, assessments and taxes. The conveyance documents shall be in a form acceptable to the city; 
(3)  The required conveyance of land to be dedicated and any payment of cash equivalency in lieu of land dedication shall be made prior to filing of the final plat or the granting of final approval; 
(4)  The removal of trees, topsoil, storage of construction equipment, burying of construction debris, or stockpiling of surplus soil on dedicated land is strictly forbidden without the written approval of the city; and 
(5)  It must not be located in drainways, floodplains or ponding areas after the site has been developed. 
(i)  Required improvements. Applicants shall be responsible for making certain improvements to their developments for park, playground and public open space purposes as follows: 
(1)  Provide finished grading and ground cover for all park, playground, and public open spaces within their development contract; and 
(2)  Where dedicated park areas fall outside a developer's plat or subdivision, the developer shall establish monumental irons on all dedicated park properties for the purpose of identifying park boundaries. The developer shall also provide a certificate of survey, prepared by a registered land surveyor, to the park and recreation department.

Sec. 122-7. - Registered land surveys and conveyance by metes and bounds. 
(a)  Registered land surveys. It is the intention of this chapter that all registered land surveys in the city should be presented to the planning commission in the form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter for preliminary plats and that the planning commission shall first approve the arrangements, sizes and relationships of proposed tracts in such registered land surveys, and that tracts to be used as easements or roads should be so dedicated. Unless such approvals have been obtained from the planning commission and city council in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter, building permits will be withheld for buildings on tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys and the city may refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve, repair or maintain any such tracts unless so approved. 
(b)  Restrictions on filing and recording conveyances. Pursuant to the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 4, no conveyance of land to which the regulations are applicable shall be filed or recorded, if the land is described in the conveyance by metes and bounds or by reference to an unapproved registered land survey made after April 21, 1961, or to an unapproved plat made after such regulations become effective. The foregoing provisions do not apply to a conveyance if the land described was: 
(1)  A separate parcel of record April 1, 1945, or the date of adoption of subdivision regulations under Laws 1945, Chapter 287, whichever is later; 
(2)  The subject of a written agreement to convey entered into prior to such time; or 
(3)  A separate parcel of not less than 2 1/2 acres in area and 150 feet in width on January 1, 1966, or is a single parcel of land of not less than 20 acres and having a width of not less than 500 feet. 
(c)  Waiver. In any case in which compliance with the foregoing restrictions will create an unnecessary hardship and failure to comply does not interfere with the purpose of these subdivision regulations, the platting authority may waive such compliance by adoption of a resolution to that effect and the conveyance may then be filed or recorded. 
(d)  Penalty. Any owner or agent of the owner of land who conveys a lot or parcel in violation of the provisions of this section shall forfeit and pay to the city a penalty of not less than $100.00 for each lot or parcel so conveyed. The city may enjoin such conveyance or may recover such penalty by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(a)  Prefiling consultation. 
(1)  Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit for review with the city, subdivision sketch plans which shall contain the following information: tract boundaries, north point, description of nature and purpose of tract, streets on and adjacent to the tract, significant topographical and physical features, proposed general street layout, and proposed general lot layout. 
(2)  Such sketch plans will be considered as submitted for informal and confidential discussion between the subdivider and the city. Submission of a subdivision sketch plan shall not constitute formal filing of a plat with the city. 
(3)  As far as may be practical on the basis of a sketch plan, the city will informally advise the subdivider as promptly as possible of the extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms to the design standards of this article and will discuss possible plan modifications necessary to ensure conformance. 
(b)  Procedure for approval of preliminary plat. 
(1)  Application for a public hearing before the planning commission shall be filed at least four weeks prior to the regular monthly meeting. The application shall be considered being officially filed when all the information requirements are complied with. 
(2)  The applicant may prepare a preliminary plat conforming to the requirements of this article and shall file with the city an application for approval of a preliminary plat. The cash fee in an amount as set forth in chapter 22 shall be required to cover city expenses in making the necessary studies for approval of such plat. The applicant shall furthermore be responsible for all city expenses in excess of those covered by the initial application fee. Each final plat submitted as part of the approved preliminary shall require an additional cash fee as established in chapter 22. 
(3)  If at any time, the cash fee deposited with the city by the applicant becomes insufficient to cover city expenses, the review of such plat shall be suspended. 
(4)  If an applicant has additional escrow accounts with the city relating to approval of several preliminary plats, these funds may be intermingled, at the direction of the city council, in order to cover city expenses on all involved plats. Prior to intermingling escrow funds, the city shall give notice to the applicant of the city's intent to intermingle funds and shall afford the applicant an opportunity to appear before the city council at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting after the notice is given to the applicant. 
(5)  If an escrow account balance is in arrears, the applicant's letter of credit may be drawn upon in the amount of the deficiency at the direction of the city council. Prior to taking any action on the applicant's letter of credit, the city shall give 30 days' notice to the applicant of the city's intention and shall afford the applicant an opportunity to appear before the city council after the notice is given to the applicant. 
(6)  The applicant at the time of filing with the city shall provide to the city six prints of the preliminary plat, six copies of sheets of data accompanying the plat, and an 11-inch by 17-inch reproducible copy of each exhibit. 
(7)  Under each of the following conditions one additional copy of every document shall be required in filing and shall be transmitted to the official referred to with advice to the effect that any recommendation for consideration by the planning commission in acting on the plat should be received prior to preliminary approval by the planning commission: 
a.  When such land abuts a county highway, the county highway engineer; 
b.  When such land abuts a state trunk highway, the state highway commissioner; and 
c.  When such land lies within the limits of the floodway and/or the flood fringe areas of the floodplain district, the department of natural resources commissioner and the appropriate watershed district. 
(8)  Prior to the public hearing, the city staff shall submit a report to the planning commission before the hearing on the preliminary plat. This report shall be on the feasibility of street location, construction, drainage problems, etc., conformity to the comprehensive plan and other planning problems. 
(9)  A public hearing shall be held by the planning commission after the filing of the preliminary plat. This hearing shall be held at the next regular meeting of the planning commission; provided that a notice of said hearing is published in the official city newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing. The newspaper notice shall include an easily understood description of the area to be subdivided. The cost of the notice shall be paid by the subdivider in addition to the cash fee for other expenses. In addition, the city shall notify, by U.S. mail, the subdivider and the record owners of the property within 350 feet of the lands within the plat not less than ten days prior to the date of the meeting. 
(10)  After consideration of all hearings, reports, comments and suggestions, the planning commission shall recommend, in writing, to the city council stating its reason therefor, either that the preliminary plat be granted approval subject to certain conditions, if any, or that the preliminary plat be disapproved. A copy of the recommendations shall be sent to the city council and to the applicant with notice to the applicant of the date when it will be considered by the city council. 
(11)  The city council shall consider the preliminary plat at its next meeting following receipt of the planning commission's recommendations. The city council shall either approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. The city shall notify the applicant in writing of the city council's action stating the conditions of approval or reasons for disapproval of the preliminary plat. If approval is given, the city shall send the applicant one copy of the preliminary plat marked with any required revisions. 
(12)  Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat (subdivision plat). Rather, it shall be deemed to be an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat and act as an authorization and guide to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. This approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year, unless an extension is granted by the city council prior to the termination of such one-year period. The subdivider may file a final plat limited to such portion of the preliminary plat that he proposes to record and develop at the time; provided that such portion must conform to all requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Procedure for approval of final plat. 
(1)  After approval of the preliminary plat by the city council, the plat may then be prepared in final form and both the survey and plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved, including the required modifications. 
(2)  Final plat shall contain all the information and requirements necessary for recording with the county register of deeds, including accurate dimensions, previously submitted and approved in the preliminary plat, which information accurately delineates and defines the subdivision included in such final plat. 
(3)  The final plat and at least six prints thereof, with required data accompanying each, including an 11-inch by 17-inch reproducible copy of each, shall be filed with the city within six months after the date of approval of the preliminary plat. The final plat shall be submitted, along with written application for approval of the final plat, at least three weeks prior to a city council meeting at which consideration is requested. The city shall retain the plats prepared for record and two prints thereof. 
(4)  One print each shall immediately be forwarded to the city for review. City staff will prepare comments prior to the next meeting of the city council. The city shall check the final plat and accompanying data for conformity with city ordinances and with these regulations, and any conditions or modification of the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Upon review by the city council, if accepted, the final plat shall be approved by resolution, which resolution shall provide for the acceptance of all streets, alleys, easements, or other public purposes. If disapproved, the grounds for any refusal to approve a plat shall be set forth in the proceedings of the city council and reported to the person or persons applying for such approval. 
(6)  Upon final approval of the final plat by the city council, the subdivider shall record it with the county register of deeds within six months after the date of approval; otherwise, the approval of the final plat is null and void. 
(7)  The subdivider shall immediately upon recording, furnish the city with a reproducible copy of the recorded plat and four prints thereof. 
(8)  The form of approval by the city is as follows:

In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and arterial highways of not less than one-half of one percent. 
(16)  The vertical and horizontal alignment standards on all streets shall be as follows: All changes in street grade of one percent or more shall be connected by vertical curves. The length of the vertical curve will be determined on the basis of providing stopping sight distances for each road classification where design speed for arterial and collector streets is 40 mph and local streets is 25 mph. In no case shall the length of the required vertical curve be less than: 
a.  For principal or minor arterial highways, 30 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes; and 
b.  For collector or local street, 20 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes. 
(17)  All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public streets, except that private streets may be permitted, following approval of the variance application, within the boundaries of property under one ownership.

Sec. 126-40. - Nonconforming uses, signs, lots, buildings and structures. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of existing structures, signs, uses, and lots that do not conform to the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located and to specify the requirements, circumstances and conditions under which the nonconforming structure, sign, use, or lot may be continued. Further, it is the general policy of the city to allow uses and structures that came into existence legally, in conformance with then-applicable requirements, to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring them into compliance with existing regulations as is reasonably possible. 
(b)  Existing use, building or lot. Any established use, building or lot legally existing which is herein classified in this chapter as requiring a conditional use permit may be continued in like fashion and activity and shall automatically be considered as having received conditional use permit approval. Any change to such a use and/or building shall however require a new conditional use permit be processed according to this chapter. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, moved, or extended to occupy a greater area of land, but may continue at the size and intensity and in the same manner of operation existing upon the date of its nonconformity. 
(2)  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. When any nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(3)  A nonconforming use may be changed to lessen the nonconformity of that use. Thereafter the use may not be so altered as to increase the nonconformity. 
(4)  A nonconforming use shall not be re-established if discontinued for a continuous one-year period. 
(5)  A building or structure used by a nonconforming use may be continued through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement, but not including expansion, unless the nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. 
(6)  A change in tenancy, ownership or management will not affect the status of a nonconforming use if the use remains the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section shall not effect the rights of the city or residents in any written agreement to the contrary entered into prior to April 5, 2005. 
(d)  Nonconforming signs. 
(1)  Business signs on the premises of a nonconforming building or use may be continued but such signs shall not be increased in number, area, height, or illumination. New signs not to exceed 35 square feet in aggregate sign area may be erected only upon the complete removal of all other signs existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Such signs may be illuminated but no flashing, rotating, or moving signs shall be permitted. 
(2)  No sign erected before the passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be rebuilt, altered, or moved to a new location without being brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(e)  Nonconforming lots of record. 
(1)  A vacant nonconforming lot may be allowed as a buildable lot; provided that the following conditions are met: 
a.  The lot is of record; and 
b.  All other applicable requirements of this chapter are met. 
(2)  Nonconforming lots containing a principle structure may add a permitted accessory structure; provided that the accessory structure will meet all minimum setback requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Additions to conforming principal or accessory structures located on nonconforming lots may be permitted; provided that any such addition will meet all other provisions of this chapter. 
(f)  Nonconforming buildings or structures. 
(1)  Any nonconforming building or other structure may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement, but not expansion, unless the nonconforming building or structure is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the building or structure was damaged. 
(2)  Nonconforming principal and accessory structures shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases their nonconformity. Nonconforming accessory structures, which are totally within a required yard setback, shall not be enlarged or expanded in any way. 
(3)  If a nonconforming structure is moved for any distance whatsoever, it shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(4)  Normal repairs and maintenance necessary to keep a nonconforming structure in sound condition shall be permitted. 
(5)  Alterations may be made to a residential building containing nonconforming residential units when they will improve the livability of such units; provided, however, that they do not increase the number of dwelling units in the building. 
(6)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the placing of a structure in a safe condition when said structure is declared unsafe by the building codes and standards of the city.

Sec. 126-65. - Purpose. 
    The principal objective of this chapter is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses, and for the proper location of all types of uses required in the social and economic welfare of the city. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of various districts established by this chapter. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses that it may be necessary to allow because of their unusual characteristics and/or service they provide the public. These special uses require particular consideration as to their proper appearance and location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses, or to the planned development of the community. 
(Code 1977, § 13-107.1) 
Sec. 126-66. - Issuance. 
    Conditional use permits may be issued for any of the following: 
(1)  Any of the uses or purposes for which such permits are required or permitted by the provisions of this chapter; 
(2)  Public utility or public service uses or public building in any district when found to be necessary for the public health, safety, convenience or welfare; 
(3)  Commercial excavating of natural materials used for building or construction purposes, in any district; 
(4)  To classify as a conforming use any nonconforming institutional use existing in any district at the time of the establishment of such district; or 
(5)  To permit the location of any of the following uses in a district from which they are excluded by the provisions of this chapter; library, community center, church, hospital, any institution of an educational, philanthropic or charitable nature, cemetery, mausoleum, or columbarium. 
(Code 1977, § 13-107.2) 
Sec. 126-67. - Initiation. 
    An application for a conditional use may be made by any governmental office, department, board, or commission or by any person or persons having a freehold interest or a contractual interest or which may become a freehold interest in the parcel described in the application. 
(Code 1977, § 13-107.3) 
Sec. 126-68. - Procedure. 
(a)  Applications. Applications for conditional use permits shall be made by the owner or owners of the property and shall be filed with the zoning administrator. All applications shall be accompanied by an administrative fee established as set forth in chapter 22 plus all additional expenses incurred by the city and shall include the following information: 
(1)  A description of the proposed use; 
(2)  A legal description of the property including plat and property identification number; 
(3)  A map or plat showing the property in question and all property within 350 feet of the boundaries of the property in question; 
(4)  The names and addresses of the owners of record of all property within 350 feet of the boundaries of the property in question; and 
(5)  Any other information required by the zoning administrator, planning commission, or city council. 
(b)  Referral to planning commission. Before any conditional use permit may be granted, the request therefor shall be referred to the planning commission for study concerning the effect of the proposed use on the comprehensive plan and on the character and development of the neighborhood, and for its recommendation to the city council for the granting of such conditional use permit and the conditions thereof, if any, or for the denial of such conditional use permit. 
(c)  Public hearing. The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposal to issue a conditional use permit. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be given not more than 30 days nor less than ten days in advance of the public hearing by publishing a notice in the official newspaper of the city and by mailing in the U.S. mail, a notice of the public hearing at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing, to the owner or owners of the property under consideration and all property owners within 350 feet of the subject property. This notice shall describe the particular conditional use and shall contain a brief description thereof. The county auditor's records shall be used for determination of ownership and mailing addresses. Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall make its findings of fact and recommendations in writing upon the proposal to the city council within 60 days following the completion (closing) of the public hearing. If no recommendations are transmitted by the planning commission within the 60 days specified, the city council shall take action without recommendations. 
(d)  Issuance. The city council may hold whatever public hearing it deems advisable. In considering applications for conditional use permits under this division, the city council shall consider the advice and recommendations of the planning commission and the effect of the proposed use upon the health, safety, morals, and welfare of occupants of surrounding lands, including, but not limited to, the factors of noise, glare, odors, existing and anticipated traffic conditions, including parking facilities on adjacent streets, the effect on values of property in the surrounding area, and the effect of the proposed use on the comprehensive plan. If it shall determine by resolution that the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community and that the same is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and the comprehensive plan, the city council may grant such permits and may impose conditions and safeguards therein. 
(e)  Denial. Conditional use permits may be denied by resolution of the city council when there is a determination and findings of fact by the city council that the proposed use will be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community or that the proposed use is not in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter or the comprehensive plan.

(c)  Conditional use permits are nontransferable except for permits issued for conditional uses specified under the allowable uses sections of this chapter for the various zoning districts. 
(Code 1977, § 13-107.5) 
Sec. 126-70. - Land alterations. 
(a)  Permit required. A conditional use permit shall be required in all cases where excavation, grading and filling of any land within the city would result in a substantial alteration of existing ground contour or would change existing drainage or would cause flooding or erosion and would deprive an adjoining property owner of lateral support and would remove or destroy the present ground cover resulting in less beneficial cover for present and proposed development, uses and enjoyment of any property in the city. The term "substantial alteration" shall be defined as the extraction, grading, or filling of land involving movement of earth and materials in excess of 150 cubic yards. 
(b)  Application. Application for a land alteration conditional use permit shall be subject to the regulations of section 126-68 and shall contain the following additional information:

(2)  The nature of the proposed alteration and future use of the property; 
(3)  The starting date and approximate completion date of the operation; 
(4)  The names of all owners of the land to be altered; 
(5)  The names and addresses of all owners and occupants of the adjoining land that may be affected by said land alterations; and 
(6)  The identification of the route to be used in hauling. 
(c)  Bonding. The city council may require from the person securing a land alteration conditional use permit adequate proof of bonding in the form of a performance bond, sufficient in value to cover the expense of the completion of the development plan or to bring such portion of the completed project to a safe grade and elevation so as to be healthful and safe to the general public and to provide safe and adequate drainage of the site. 
(d)  Safety precautions. If, during the land alteration work, it becomes necessary for the person altering the land to create a condition of grade or drainage not in the interest of health or safety, it shall become that person's duty to correct immediately the dangerous situation created, as well as fence such area from the general public during the period of danger. 
(e)  Replacement of landscaping. The person responsible for the proposed land alteration shall agree to replace cover that has been removed, by seeding or sodding, such cover to be replaced within 30 days after completion of grading. Where construction of homes or buildings is being done over an extended period of time, the zoning administrator or city council may require replacement of ground cover on a portion of the area before the entire project is completed. 
(f)  Correction of hazardous excavation. The city council may, in addition to any or all other remedies available for violation of this section, order the owner to correct any hazardous excavation, grading, or filling on his land. 
(1)  Order. The order shall: 
a.  Be in writing; 
b.  Recite the grounds therefore; 
c.  Specify the necessary work; and 
d.  Provide a reasonable time for compliance, not to exceed 30 days. 
(2)  Service. The order shall be served by registered mail to the last known address of the owner of record, or his agent, if an agent is in charge of the excavation, grading, or filling, and upon the occupying tenant, if there is one. 
(3)  Enforcement. If the owner of the land fails to comply with the order within the time set forth therein, the city council shall cause the necessary work to be completed to bring the land within reasonable standards of health and safety.

c.  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality; 
d.  Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. 
(e)  Conditions authorized . The City Council may impose conditions in the granting of variances. A condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance. 
(f)  Specific variances authorized. No variance shall be granted that would allow any use that is not allowed in the zoning district in which the subject property is located, except as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in Minn. Stats. 216C.06, subd. 14, when in harmony with official controls. 
(2)  A variance may be granted for the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling. 
(g)  Appeals. Any person, firm, or corporation objecting to the ruling of any official on the administering of the provisions of this section shall have the right to appeal to the board.

Sec. 126-156. - District classification. 
    In order to provide orderly, economic and safe development and to classify and regulate the location of various land uses, and the location of buildings designated for specific uses; to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas and to regulate and determine the areas of yards, recreation and open space within and surrounding such buildings, the city is hereby divided into 14 districts. The use, height and area regulations shall be uniform in each district. Districts shall be known as: 
(1)  Residential districts. 
R-A Agriculture-residential district R-1L Large lot single-family residential district R-1 Single-family residential district R-2 Two-family residential district R-3 Low density multiple-family residential district R-4 Medium density multiple-family residential district R-5 High density multiple-family residential district

(Code 1977, § 13-109.1; Ord. No. 630, § 13-109.1, 1-8-2007; Ord. No. 663, 9-22-2008) 
Sec. 126-157. - Zoning map. 
    The location and boundaries of the districts established by this chapter are hereby set forth on the zoning map and said map is hereby made a part of this chapter; said map shall be known as the "City of Champlin Zoning Map." Said map and all notations, references, and data shown thereon are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter and shall be as much a part of it as if all were fully described herein. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to maintain said map, and amendments thereto shall be recorded on said zoning map within 30 days after official publication of amendments. The official zoning map shall be kept on file in the city hall. The county flood insurance study for the city prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), dated September 2, 2004, and the water surface profiles and flood boundary and floodway maps therein are attached to and made a part of the zoning map and this chapter. 
(Code 1977, § 13-109.2; Ord. No. 600, 8-23-2004) 
Sec. 126-158. - New subdivisions. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to allow the creation of newly subdivided lots, with a minimum area less than provided in any zoning district except where allowed in special regulation for each district as specified in this chapter. 
(Code 1977, § 13-109.3) 
Sec. 126-159. - Boundary lines. 
    Wherever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any use district as shown on the zoning map incorporated herein, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Where district boundary lines are indicated as following streets, alleys, or similar rights-of-way, they shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof; 
(2)  Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines or section lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries; 
(3)  Where a lot held in one ownership, and of record at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, is divided by a district boundary line, the entire lot shall be construed to be within the less restricted district; provided that this construction shall not apply if it increases the area of the less restricted portion of the lot by more than 20 percent; 
(4)  Where figures are shown on the zoning map between a street or property line and a district boundary line, they indicate that the district boundary lines run parallel to the street line or property line at a distance therefrom equivalent to the number of feet so indicated, unless otherwise indicated; and 
(5)  The floodplain district boundaries have been based on the available flood data for the city. The boundaries of the floodplain district shall be determined by scaling distances on the zoning map (where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) and if an inspection is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, the board of adjustment and city council shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. Where such a conflict is found to exist, flood elevations shall be the governing factor in locating regulatory floodplain limits. In the event floodplain district boundaries are changed through the above procedures, the commissioner of natural resources must be notified of the change and his approval obtained. 
(Code 1977, § 13-109.4) 
Sec. 126-160. - Uses not provided for within zoning districts. 
    Whenever in any zoning district a use is not specifically allowed as a permitted, accessory, or conditional use, the use shall be considered prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 605, 1-24-2005) 
Sec. 126-161. - Architecture. 
(a)  It is not the intent of the city to unreasonably restrict design freedom when reviewing project architecture in connection with a site or building plan. However, it is in the best interest of the city to promote high standards of architectural design. 
(b)  This standard applies to all commercial, industrial and multifamily districts within the Highway 169 Corridor: 
(1)  Major exterior surfaces on walls shall be face brick or stone. Glass, stucco, architecturally treated concrete, cast-in-place or precast panels or decorative block will be acceptable as the major exterior wall surface when they are incorporated into an all overall design which is compatible with the standards for the district in which it is located. Wood and metal may be used as accent materials; provided that they are appropriately integrated into the overall building design and not suited in areas that will be subject to damage associated with heavy use; 
(2)  Under no circumstances shall sheet metal aluminum, corrugated aluminum, asbestos, iron plain or painted, or plain concrete block be acceptable as major exterior wall material on buildings within the city except for industrial and large retail commercial buildings (greater than 100,000 square feet), rear and side exterior surfaces that are not visible from any public street or adjoining property may be constructed of a lesser material than the front of the building; 
(3)  Garages, accessory structures, screen walls and exposed areas of retaining walls shall be of a similar type, quality, and appearance as the principal structure unless such a structure is not visible or is fully screened from any public street or adjacent property; and 
(4)  A nonconforming building or structure shall not be altered or enlarged in any manner unless such alterations or enlargements are made to bring the building or structure into conformity with the regulations of this chapter.

(6)  The purpose of this subsection is to establish lighting requirements for personal safety and crime prevention while regulating the spill over of light and glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses near a light source to promote personal and traffic safety and to prevent the creation of public nuisances. 
a.  The terms defined herein shall have the meanings given them: 
Cut-off angle means the angle formed by a line drawn from the direction of the light rays at the light source on a line perpendicular to the ground from the light source, beyond which no light is emitted. 
Footcandle means the international unit of illumination produced on a surface. 
Glare means the effect produced by the intensity and direction of any artificial illumination sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort or impairment of vision. 
b.  Exterior lighting shall be designed and arranged to limit direct illumination and glare in any contiguous parcel of land. Reflected glare or spill light shall not exceed five-tenths footcandle when the source of light abuts any residential parcel, or one footcandle when the source of lights abuts any commercial or industrial parcel or any public right-of-way measured at one foot above the ground at the property line. 
c.  Any lighting shall be arranged so as not to shine directly on adjoining property. A person shall not conduct a use that has a source of illumination that produces glare clearly visible beyond a property line or creates a sensation within a visual field to cause annoyance, discomfort or impaired vision. The use of lenses, deflectors and shields shall be used to eliminate nuisance and hazardous lighting. 
d.  The city may limit the hours of operation of outdoor lighting equipment if the city deems it necessary to reduce the impact of light on the surrounding neighborhood. 
e.  Light poles or standards for exterior lighting shall not exceed 35 feet in height, except when a luminaire is located within 200 feet of a residential property, in which case the maximum height shall be 25 feet. 
f.  All luminaires, including wall mounted units, shall contain fully shielded fixtures with a flat lens and a cutoff angle of 90 degrees or less.

i.  Any new lighting installed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be in compliance with the requirements of this section. Any lighting in existence before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived that does not comply with its requirements shall be considered legally noncomplying and may remain, subject to the following: When poles or wall-mounted fixtures are removed and replaced for reasons other than accidents, they must be replaced with luminaires and poles that comply; and when a new parking lot or an addition to an existing parking lot is constructed, the new lot or lot addition must be provided with complying lighting. 
j.  Temporary lighting for festivals, parades or civic events is exempt from the provisions of this subsection (7). 
(7)  The following shall be controlled: 
a.  Noise. Noises emanating from any use shall be in compliance with and regulated by chapter 7030, Minnesota Administrative Rules for the state pollution control agency, air quality division, as amended. 
b.  Odor. No activity or operation shall cause, at any time, the discharge of toxic, noxious or odorous matter beyond the limits of the immediate site where it is located in such concentrations as to be obnoxious or otherwise detrimental to or endanger the public health, welfare, comfort or safety or cause injury to property or business. 
c.  Vibration. Vibration shall not be discernible at any property line to the human sense of feeling for three minutes or more duration in any one hour. Vibration of any kind shall not produce at any time an acceleration of more than one-tenth gravities or shall not result in any combination of amplitudes and frequencies beyond the "safe" range of Table VII, United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 442, "Seismic Effects of Quarry Blasting," on any structure. The methods and equations of said Bulletin No. 442 shall be used to compute all values for the enforcement of this subsection. 
d.  Smoke. As regulated by the state pollution control agency. 
e.  Dust. As regulated by the state pollution control agency. 
f.  Fumes and gases. Fumes or gases shall not be emitted at any point in concentrations or amounts that are noxious, toxic, or corrosive. The values given in Table I (Industrial Hygiene Standards - Maximum Allowable Concentration for 8-Hour Day, Five Days Per Week), Table III (Odor Thresholds), and Table IV (Concentrations of Substances Causing Pain in the Eyes), and Table V (Exposure to Substances Causing Damage to Vegetation) in the latest revision of Chapter 5, "Physiological Effects," that contains such tables, in the "Air Pollution Abatement Manual," by Manufacturing Chemists' Association, Inc., Washington, D.C., are hereby established as guides for the determination of permissible concentration or amounts. Detailed plans for the elimination of fumes or gases may be required before the issuance of a building permit. 
g.  Hazard. Every operation shall be carried on with reasonable precautions against fire and explosion hazards. 
h.  Investigations and tests. In order to ensure compliance with the performance standards set forth above, the city may require the owner or operator of any permitted use to have made such investigations and tests as may be required to show adherence to the performance standards. Such investigation and tests as are required to be made shall be carried out by an independent testing organization as may be agreed upon by all parties concerned, or if there is failure to agree, by such independent testing organization as may be selected by the city after 30 days notice. The costs incurred in having such investigations or tests conducted shall be paid by the owner or operator if a violation is established, otherwise by the city. 
(8)  The procedure stated above shall not preclude the city from making any tests and investigations it finds appropriate to determine compliance with these performance standards.

DIVISION 4. - SPECIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 126-287. - Old town conversion overlay district. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The old town area currently contains many single-family structures that lie within commercial zoning districts. These single-family structures are on small single-family lots that, alone, could not support a new commercial building and/or parking area that meets current city standards. Further, it is reasonable to expect that these single-family structures will be converted to commercial establishments. 
(2)  Because the city strives for a well-planned community that protects the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, there is a need for an ordinance that regulates the conversion of existing single-family structures to commercial establishments. 
(3)  Because the conversion of existing single-family structures is unique to the old town area, there is a need to establish an overlay district which stipulates site performance guidelines to regulate setbacks, lot coverage, parking, landscaping, allowable uses, building exteriors, maintenance, screening, and lighting. These standards will ensure against detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and public interest, by providing for a pleasant, attractive, and aesthetically pleasing environment. 
(b)  General requirements. 
(1)  Allowable uses. Each potential commercial land use has unique characteristics that would affect its location in an existing single-family structure. Because of this, the underlying commercial zoning classification shall govern the allowable uses and a conditional use permit shall be required for every allowable use. 
(2)  Lot coverage. 
a.  Maximum building coverage shall be 20 percent of the lot. 
b.  Maximum impervious surface coverage shall be 50 percent of the lot. 
(3)  Building setbacks. 
a.  Principal structure. 
1.  Front yard. New construction shall not encroach into the front yard setbacks any further than currently exists. 
2.  Side yard (street). New construction shall not encroach into the street side yard setbacks any further than currently exists. 
3.  Side yard. New construction shall not encroach the side yard setback any further than currently exists or ten feet, whichever is greater. 
4.  Rear yard. New construction shall not encroach into the rear yard setback any further than currently exists or 30 feet, whichever is less. 
b.  Accessory structure. 
1.  Front yard. No accessory structure shall be located in the front yard setback area. 
2.  Side yard (street). No accessory structure shall be located in the street side yard setback area. 
3.  Side yard. No accessory structure shall be located within ten feet of the side yard setback area (if adjacent to R-1 or R-2 residential this setback shall be 30 feet). 
4.  Rear yard. No accessory structure shall be located within 30 feet of the rear yard setback area. 
(4)  Parking. 
a.  Require number of stalls. The required number of stalls shall be as regulated by section 126-419. 
b.  Setbacks. Parking setbacks shall be as follows: 
1.  Front yard : ten feet. 
2.  Side yard (street): 15 feet. 
3.  Side yard: five feet. 
4.  Rear yard: not permitted. 
c.  Curb and gutter. Concrete box (B 6-12) curbing is required along the perimeter of all paved areas. 
(5)  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be as regulated in section 126-216. 
(6)  Screening. 
a.  Screening and buffering shall be satisfied through the use of screening fences, walls, earth berms, and/or planting screens. If the topography, existing vegetation, permanent structures, or other features create a barrier that meets the screening requirements, they may be substituted. 
b.  In addition to the foregoing, additional screening regulations are contained in section 126-217. 
(7)  Building exteriors. 
a.  The conversion of existing single-family structures into a commercial use is a unique situation that requires specific architectural control measures to ensure compatibility with surrounding structures. 
b.  It is not the intent of the city to unreasonably restrict design freedom when reviewing project architecture in connection with a site or building plan. However, it is in the best interest of the city to promote high standards of architectural design. 
c.  This standard applies to all commercial and industrial underlying districts within the old town overlay district. Further: 
1.  The existing character of the principal structure shall be kept. Alterations to the existing structure are permitted when the character of the existing structure is not adversely affected. 
2.  Upgrades to the existing structure shall be done with materials that are consistent with the age and quality of the building or structure being altered. 
3.  Garages, accessory structures, screen walls and exposed areas of retaining walls shall be of similar type, quality, and appearance as the principal structure. 
4.  A nonconforming building or structure shall not be altered or enlarged in any manner unless such alterations or enlargements are made to bring the building or structure into conformity with the regulations of this section. 
(8)  Lighting. 
a.  All sources of artificial light situated in nonresidential sites shall be so fixed, directed, designed or sized that the sum total of their illumination will not increase the level of illumination on any nearby residential property by more than one-tenth footcandle in or within 25 feet of a dwelling nor more than five-tenths footcandle on any other part of the property. 
b.  All commercial lighting shall be located in the front and street side yard areas. No commercial lighting shall be located in the rear and side yard areas. 
(9)  Site maintenance. 
a.  The property owner shall be responsible for replacement of any dead trees, shrubs, ground covers, and sodding. If any plant materials are not maintained or replaced, the city shall maintain or replace said materials and assess the property for the costs thereof after due notice to the property owner. 
b.  The building exteriors shall be kept in reasonable repair and maintained in such a manner as not to create an adverse appearance. 
(10)  Destruction. No building or structure which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or any other cause, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value shall be restored except in conformity with the regulations of this section which govern the underlying land use.

DIVISION 5. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 126-308. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The PUD is supplementary to all other zoning districts contained in this chapter, the purpose of which is to encourage, under appropriate circumstances, a more creative, varied and efficient use of land in the city. Where such supplementary zoning is approved, it shall be deemed supplementary and superimposed over the basic zoning of the property under consideration. Where a conflict may arise between the requirements of the supplementary and basic zoning, those requirements related to the supplementary zoning shall prevail. 
(b)  The provisions of this section are intended to provide residential and commercial areas that can be developed with some modification of the strict application of the normal zoning district regulations in accordance with the provisions and regulations contained herein. 
(c)  The PUD can be developed within any zoning district and is intended to encourage: 
(1)  Flexibility in land development to benefit from new technology in building design and construction and land development; 
(2)  Variety in the organization of site elements and building design through the use of trained and experienced land planners, registered architects and/or landscape architects to prepare plans for all planned unit developments; 
(3)  Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics and open space; and 
(4)  More efficient and effective use of land, open space and public facilities. 
(Code 1977, § 13-112.1) 
Sec. 126-309. - Permitted uses. 
    Land and/or buildings shall be permitted or allowed as conditional uses in the districts. 
(Code 1977, § 13-112.2) 
Sec. 126-310. - Lot area, setback, height and coverage regulations. 
(a)  Minimum lot area requirement. The minimum total lot area shall be not less than ten acres. Lots of less than ten acres may qualify only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived because a PUD is in the public interest and that one or both of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard provisions of the normal district would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community; or 
(2)  The property is adjacent to or across the street from property that has been developed under the provisions of this section and will contribute to the neighborhood. 
(b)  Number of dwelling units. 
(1)  A PUD may provide for a variety of housing and building types in any one of the basic zoning districts. The total number of dwelling units allowed in a development shall be determined by either: 
a.  The area standards of the zoning district in which the proposed development is to be located; or 
b.  The density specified by the planning commission or city council consistent with the intent of the city's land use plan. 
(2)  A plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations applicable to the site, but the density or intensity of land use exceeds by more than ten percent that permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to the site, the applicant has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The planning commission and city council, in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public facilities and services to be achieved by: 
a.  The location, amount and proposed use of common open space; 
b.  The location design and type of dwelling units; and 
c.  The physical characteristics of the site. 
(c)  Front, rear and side yard building setback regulations. 
(1)  Single- and two-family residential developments. Building setbacks from all property lines which form the perimeter of the total property in the PUD or from all interior and exterior dedicated street rights-of-way lines or from the paving of any private interior circulation streets shall be as follows or as established during the final PUD process: 
Front yard: 30 feet Side yard (garage): 5 feet Side yard (living): 10 feet Street side yard: 30 feet Rear yard: 20 feet  
(2)  Multifamily, commercial, and industrial developments. Building setbacks from all property lines which form the perimeter of the total property in the PUD or from all interior and exterior dedicated street rights-of-way lines or from the paving of any private interior circulation street shall be 20 feet or the height of the building, whichever is greater. 
(d)  Building height regulations. No building shall exceed the height limitation of the district in which it is located. 
(e)  Lot coverage. 
(1)  In residential districts, the total ground area occupied by buildings in a PUD shall not exceed 20 percent of the total site area. If the total project is to be phased regulated below, open space shall be provided so that the ground coverage of each phase shall not exceed the maximum allowable coverage. 
(2)  In nonresidential districts, the total ground area occupied by buildings in a PUD shall not exceed 50 percent of the total site area. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) shall be determined by dividing the sum total of the gross area of all floors of the principal structures on a site by the gross area of the total site. 
(Code 1977, § 13-112.3) 
Sec. 126-311. - Building and site design, construction and maintenance regulations. 
(a)  More than one building may be placed on one platted or recorded lot in any PUD. Areas for single-family detached dwellings must comply with chapter 122, pertaining to subdivisions, in all respects not specifically noted in this section as appropriate variances or waivers. 
(b)  A PUD which only involves one building or housing type, such as all detached or all attached units, shall not be considered as inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval. 
(c)  The overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to other site elements or to surrounding development will be the primary consideration in the review stages of the planning commission and city council. 
(d)  No building permit shall be granted for any building on land for which a plan for a PUD is in the process of review or which does not conform to the approved final plan or for one phase of the final plan. 
(e)  The staging of the development shall include the following: 
(1)  Any PUD plan proposed to be constructed in stages shall include full details relative thereto and the city council may approve or modify where necessary, any such proposals; 
(2)  The staging shall include the time for beginning and completion of each stage. Such timing may be modified by the city council on the showing of good cause by the developer; and 
(3)  The land owner or developer shall make such easements, covenants and other arrangements and shall furnish such performance bond or bonds as may be determined by the city council to be reasonably required to ensure performance and completion of private streets and utilities, landscaping and privately owned and maintained recreational facilities in accordance with the plan and to protect the public interest in the event of abandonment of the plan before completion. 
(f)  Open space requirements for PUDs shall be as follows: 
(1)  Primary function. A primary function of the PUD provision is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum intensity or density allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial including, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  The amount and location of common open space shall be consistent with the stated purpose and intent of this section and in no case shall be less than 15 percent of the total project area. The planning commission and city council may determine that portions of this open space will be dedicated to the city for general public recreation or open space purposes as prescribed in chapter 122, subdivisions; and 
b.  All common open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or designed functions. 
(2)  Operating and maintenance requirements for planned unit developments common facilities. In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within the PUD for private recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of such land and buildings shall enter into an agreement with the city to ensure the continued operation and maintenance to a predetermined reasonable standard. These common areas may be placed under the ownership of one of the following, depending which is more appropriate: 
a.  Dedicated to the public where a community-wide use would be anticipated; 
b.  Owner or lessor control; or 
c.  The homeowner's association; provided all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The homeowner's association must be incorporated pursuant to Minn. Stats. ch. 317, and prior to any sale; 
2.  Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer; 
3.  The open space restrictions must be permanent, not for a given period of years; 
4.  The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes, and the maintenance of residential and other facilities; 
5.  Landowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost. The assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the property in accordance with the state statutes; and 
6.  The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs. 
(3)  Covenants, easements and restrictions. The final plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of such residential units, nonresidential uses and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the planned unit development and are consistent with the best interests of the entire city. All or any of the covenants, easements, and other provisions, if part of the final plan, may be modified, enforced, removed, or released as deemed necessary by the city council for the preservation of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of all city residents. 
(4)  Streets, utilities, services and public facilities. The uniqueness of each proposal for a PUD requires that specifications and standards for streets, utilities and services may be subject to minor modifications from the specifications and standards established in this and other city ordinances governing their construction. The city council may, therefore, waive or modify the specifications or standards where it is found that they are not required in the interest of the residents of the entire city. The plans and profiles of all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed, modified, if necessary, and approved by the city engineer, fire marshal and building official prior to the final approval of the PUD plan by the city council. All PUD projects shall be served by public sanitary sewer, storm sewer and municipal water. All utilities including electrical shall be placed underground.

Sec. 126-349. - Woodland and significant tree protection. 
(a)  Findings and purpose. The city recognizes that preservation and replanting of trees is important on new development sites in order to maintain a healthy and desirable community. The purposes of tree preservation regulations are: 
(1)  Prevention of soil erosion; 
(2)  Improvement of air quality; 
(3)  Energy conservation through natural insulation and shading; 
(4)  Increased property values; 
(5)  Protection of privacy by maintaining and establishing buffers between conflicting uses; and 
(6)  Providing habitat for wildlife. 
(b)  Scope. The regulations contained in this section shall apply to all properties involving a site plan application or preliminary plat/lot division application resulting in the creation of one or more new development parcels and to property during construction after subdivision or when not connected with subdivision. 
(c)  Heritage trees. 
(1)  Upon nomination by any person and with the written consent of the property owner, the city council, after public hearing, may designate a tree as a heritage tree. A tree may be designated as a heritage tree upon a finding that it is unique and of importance to the community due to any of the following factors: 
a.  It is an outstanding specimen of a desirable species; 
b.  It is one of the largest or oldest trees in the city; or 
c.  It possesses distinctive form, size, age, location, and/or historical significance. 
(2)  After city council approval of a heritage tree designation, the property owner shall execute and record with the county recorder or, if appropriate, the county registrar of titles, a conservation easement of unlimited duration pursuant to Minn. Stats. ch. 84C over said tree. A listing of trees so designated, including the specific locations thereof, shall be kept by the community development department. Once designated, a heritage tree shall be subject to the provisions of this section unless removed from the list of heritage trees by action of the city council. The city council may remove a tree from the list upon its own motion or upon written request by the property owner. 
(d)  Intent. 
(1)  Developments, structures, utilities, and all other site activities must be designed, installed and constructed so that the maximum number of trees are preserved on all lots or parcels with special emphasis on the following: 
a.  Specimen trees (trees larger than 24 inches DBH); 
b.  Heritage trees; and 
c.  Trees and/or woodlands that serve as a buffer between existing and proposed subdivisions. 
(2)  Flexibility of city standards shall be considered when possible to ensure the preservation of the maximum number of trees. 
(e)  Tree preservation plan required. To minimize tree loss and to mitigate tree removal on wooded lots or parcels containing trees, a tree preservation plan shall be submitted with all site plan, preliminary plat and lot division applications. The plan shall be approved by the city. 
(f)  Tree preservation plan content. The content of all tree preservation plans submitted shall, for purposes of city staff review, include the following: 
(1)  A tree inventory indicating size, species, location, and condition of all significant trees (six-inch DBH or greater) and clumps of nonsignificant trees within the site limits; 
(2)  Identification of trees to be protected, preserved, or undisturbed and to be removed; 
(3)  Areas proposed to be designated as natural preserves where all natural vegetation will be protected and preserved; 
(4)  Proposed disturbance zones; 
(5)  Location and dimensions of building pads, construction zone for each lot and grading contours of the site; 
(6)  Locations and details of tree protection fencing to be installed for all trees to be preserved; and 
(7)  Calculation of significant tree inches removed on the site. 
(g)  Tree preservation barriers. 
(1)  There shall be no movement, clearing, or storage of equipment within a designated tree protection area. No person shall permit the placement of construction materials, debris, soil deposits, or fill within the canopy of any protected tree areas. 
(2)  Before any construction or grading takes place, snow fencing or erosion control fencing shall be installed around the borders of wooded areas at the drip-line of outer trees. If less protection is necessary due to the proximity of building structures or infrastructure, such reduced protection shall require approval by the city prior to any construction activity taking place. 
(3)  No construction work shall begin until the protective fencing is installed and inspected by the city. 
(4)  Silt barriers or similar effective erosion control barriers shall be required in any area where erosion or siltation may cause damage to protected trees. 
(5)  All protective fencing and erosion control barriers must be maintained throughout the land disturbance and construction process. 
(6)  The mowing, clearing, and grubbing of brush or debris located within or under the drip-line of existing trees may be allowed; provided such mowing, clearing, or grubbing is accomplished by hand or by mowers. The use of heavy equipment for this purpose is not allowed. 
(h)  Standards of preservation during subdivision. 
(1)  Developments in residential districts may remove or disturb up to 50 percent of the total inches of significant trees. Any removal or disturbance beyond this threshold shall require reforestation or restitution. 
(2)  Developments in nonresidential districts may remove or disturb up to 60 percent of the total inches of significant trees. Any removal or disturbance beyond this threshold shall require reforestation or restitution. 
(3)  Tree inches of significant trees to be removed for water quality treatment ponds and rights-of-way for arterial and major collector roadways shall be exempt from the calculation of total significant tree inches on a development site. 
(i)  Standards of preservation during construction after subdivision or when not connected with subdivision. 
(1)  In residential subdivisions, the builder shall be responsible for working with the community development department for the protection of the trees to be preserved on a particular lot. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit by the city, the applicant for such building permit shall provide a certified survey identifying the location, size and species of trees six inches DBH or larger in size. Such survey shall indicate trees to be removed and those to be saved. 
(3)  The builder shall be required to replace significant trees removed from within the building pad on a basis of one-half-inch tree replacement for each one inch of tree removed. 
(j)  Reforestation/restitution requirement. If a development tree preservation plan exceeds the allowable removal or disturbance threshold, the subdivider shall either reforest within the site or pay restitution, or provide a combination thereof, as determined by the city. For each one inch of significant tree that is removed beyond the threshold, the subdivider shall replant one inch of new tree or provide the city with $100.00 in restitution. 
(k)  Reforestation/restitution plan. 
(1)  If the amount of significant tree inches to be removed or disturbed exceeds the specified threshold, the subdivider shall provide a reforestation plan, or a calculation of restitution, or a combination thereof, as determined by the city.

d.  Replacement trees on a reforestation plan may count toward the trees required by the city's landscaping regulations; 
e.  Reforestation plantings shall be guaranteed for one full growing season; and 
f.  Restitution shall be paid to the city prior to the city's release of the signed final plat mylars, or prior to the approval of a minor subdivision. Any restitution shall be placed in a fund to be used for reforestation projects in the city. 
(l)  Restrictions for properties not undergoing development. The number of trees removed from privately owned land shall be limited to two significant trees per year, unless an approved tree replacement plan has been obtained. The following trees are exempt from this provision: 
(1)  Trees removed because they are dead or diseased; 
(2)  Trees that are an obstruction to traffic or power lines; 
(3)  Trees that pose a hazard to structures; and 
(4)  If the removal of the tree is consistent with good forestry practices. 
(m)  Penalties. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section or any tree preservation plan approved thereunder shall be guilty of an offense punishable as a misdemeanor. In addition, any and all permits and approvals extended by the city in connection with the property on which the violation occurs may be suspended or revoked after notice and an opportunity to be heard, and the city may also deny a certificate of occupancy or pursue injunctive relief and/or damages.

(e)  Liability. By granting a conditional use permit to encroach into an easement, the city shall not be held liable for any damages caused to the improvement. 
(f)  Abatement. 
(1)  Whenever the city official charged with enforcement of a conditional use permit determines that an improvement is being maintained or exists in violation of the said approved conditional use permit, the officer shall notify, in writing, the owner-occupant of the premises of such fact in order that said improvement is corrected in conformance with said conditional use permit (or removed from premises). The notice shall be served in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises are not occupied and the owner is unknown, the notice may be served by posting it on the premises. The notice shall specify the steps to be taken to make the improvements in conformance with the conditional use permit and the time; not exceeding ten days, or solely in the case of notice by posting not exceeding 30 days, within which the improvements are to be made. If the notice is not complied with within the time specified, the enforcing official shall report that fact forthwith to the city council. Thereafter, the council may, after notice to the owner-occupant and an opportunity to be heard, provide for satisfying the conditional use permit requirements by the city. This notice shall be served in the same manner as notice by the enforcing official is served and shall be given at least ten days before the date stated in the notice when the council will consider the matter. If the notice is given by posting, at least 30 days shall elapse between the date of posting and the hearing. 
(2)  Notwithstanding subsection (f)(1) of this section, in the event an official charged with enforcement of this section determines that an improvement presents an eminent danger or serious harm to the public health or safety, the enforcing officer shall serve written notice on the owner, occupant, or agent of the property owner to have such improvement corrected or removed within five days of the date of said notice. Upon expiration of the time stated in the notice, the city may correct or remove said improvement unless a written request for hearing before the city council has been filed with the enforcing officer within that time. Upon receipt of the request, the enforcing officer shall place the matter before the council at its next regularly scheduled city council meeting. The enforcing officer shall notify the property owner of the date, time and place of the meeting. All action by the city to correct or remove the improvement, once the written request for hearing has been served, shall be suspended until such hearing at which time the owner shall be provided with the opportunity to be heard. The city council shall have the authority to affirm, amend, or reject the decision of the enforcing officer. 
(g)  Recovery or cost. 
(1)  The owner of the premises on which a correction to a conditional use permit approved improvement has been requested by the city council shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the city's corrective action, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the city clerk or other official designated by the council shall prepare a bill or the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon, the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the city clerk. 
(2)  If the improvement in subsection (g)(1) of this section is a public health or safety hazard on private property, the city clerk shall, on or before September 1 next following corrective action, list the total unpaid charges for each action against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The council may then spread the charges or any portion thereof against the property involved as a special assessment under other pertinent statutes, for certification to the county auditor and collection the following year along with the current taxes. Such assessment shall be payable in no more than ten equal annual installments, pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 429.01, subd. 2.
