PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Warrensburg of a general and permanent nature, except those ordinances adopted by the city council in executive session or closed meeting. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as supplemented through April 14, 1980, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1970 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2, and 3-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guide-posts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Andrew D. Connally, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Bruce A. Bailey, City Counselor and Nancy Anderson, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Cross reference- AE adult entertainment district regulations, § 27-119. 

Sec. 2.5-1. - Declaration of findings and policies. 
    The city council makes findings of fact and declares the policy of the city to be as follows: 
(1)  Certain conduct occurring on premises offering adult entertainment is detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore, such conduct must be regulated as provided herein. 
(2)  Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. 
(3)  It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors; to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult; and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible. 
(4)  It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering certain kinds of adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of customers, entertainers and other employees. 
(5)  The license and permit fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry. 
(6)  Businesses providing adult entertainment are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution, disruptive conduct and other criminal activity which is currently not subject to effective regulation and which constitutes an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety. 
(7)  Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary to deter prostitution or high-risk sexual conduct that may be associated with adult entertainment facilities and to limit the health hazards of syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis-B, and HIV/AIDS that may result. 
(Ord. No. 2850, § 1(1), 6-14-93) 
Sec. 2.5-2. - Application of other provisions.

    Special flood hazard area. See "area of special flood hazard." 
    Special hazard area means an area having special flood hazards and shown on an FHBM, FIRM or FBFM as zones (unnumbered or numbered) A and AE. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvements were within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, the erection of temporary forms, nor installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    State coordinating agency means that agency of the state government, or other office designated by the governor of the state or by state statute at the request of the administrator to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in that state.

"Structure" for insurance purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. The term includes repetitive loss buildings (see definition). 
    For the purposes of this definition, "repair" is considered to occur when the first repair or reconstruction of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences. 
    The term does not apply to: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure"; or 
(c)  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during the life of the building, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the building. For the purposes of this definition, an improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work done. 
    The term does not apply to: 
(a)  any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure"; or 
(c)  Any building that has been damaged from any source or is categorized as repetitive loss. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the community. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 4586, § 1(Exh. A), 9-16-10; Ord. No. 4649, § 1(Exh. A), 4-11-11) 
Sec. 6-116. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 77.260 and 78.570 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Council of the City of Warrensburg, Missouri ordains as follows. 
(Ord. No. 4586, § 1(Exh. A), 9-16-10; Ord. No. 4649, § 1(Exh. A), 4-11-11) 
Sec. 6-120. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Warrensburg, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one (1) percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Johnson County dated July 4, 2011 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

Sec. 6-125. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 6-130; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this article to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(c)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

Preferred locations in order of priority in both type districts are (a) major street landscape easements, (b) rear yards, and (c) side adjacent to a street lot line on a corner lot. Placements within side yards not bordered by a street or within front yards are discouraged.

Black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Sight-proof screening, landscape or otherwise, may be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be approved by the director prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The person responsible for the facilities shall be responsible for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials for so long as the installation remains in place. Alternative concealment may be approved by the director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements.

Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner and so as to not emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and in accordance with all applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code, and all other applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations. 
e.  No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements, or other extraneous markings on the facilities, except such necessary minimal markings approved by the city as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation. 
f.  If the application of this subsection excludes locations for facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the director shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but the city shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant. 
(2)  Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing, or operating facilities, and the person on whose behalf the work is being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing structures and property belonging to the city and any other person. Any and all rights of way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or replaced, and the responsible person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by the director and to the director's satisfaction. 
(3)  The applicant shall provide written notice to all property owners within one hundred and eighty-five (185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation, replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be done, the location of work, and the time and duration of the work. 
(4)  At the city's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities shall protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation, or maintenance of streets or other public works or to protect the public right of way or the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(5)  If a person installs facilities without having complied with the requirements of this article or abandons the facilities by failing to continuously utilize the facility for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days, said person shall remove the facilities, and if the person fails to remove the facilities within a reasonable period of time, the city may, to the extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's expense. 
(6)  Facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as part of this Code, including but not limited to building codes, zoning requirements and rights of way management regulations in addition to the regulations provided herein.

(2)  Identify the land uses shown in the Warrensburg Comprehensive City Plan for the proposed development site under study, as well as the ultimate arterial and collector street network in the vicinity of the site (at least the first arterial or collector street in each direction around the site). 
(3)  Identify the functional classification of the public street(s) bordering the site and those streets on which access for the development is proposed. The functional classification is shown on the latest major street map. 
(4)  Document current public street characteristics adjacent to the site, including the nearest arterial and collector streets (number and types of lanes, speed limits or eighty-fifth percentile speeds, and sight distances along the public street(s) from proposed access). 
(5)  Compare proposed access with established design criteria (driveway spacing, width of driveway, and minimum sight distances). 
(6)  Estimate the number of trips generated by existing and proposed development on the site for a typical weekday and weekday peak hours using the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the ITE. If local trip generation characteristics are available, they may be used if determined to be appropriate by the city traffic engineer. Calculate the net difference in trips between existing and proposed uses. If the development site already has an approved plan, also estimate the number of trips that would be generated by the approved land uses. If the development application is proposing a land use different than indicated in the Warrensburg Comprehensive City Plan, also estimate the number of trips that would be generated by the land use indicated by the comprehensive city plan. The city's traffic engineer shall approve the potential land use intensity in such cases. 
(7)  Document current peak hour traffic volumes on a typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday and/or Thursday), and estimate the total hourly trips generated by the development during a twenty-four-hour typical weekday. Traffic volumes should be measured at any existing site driveway(s) and on the adjacent collector streets, including the nearest collector/arterial street intersection in each direction along streets bordering the development site. The time periods in which existing traffic is counted should generally coincide with the highest combination of existing traffic plus traffic expected to be generated by the proposed development. Traffic volume counts shall include left-turns through and right-turn movements on all approaches and shall be tabulated in no greater than fifteen-minute increments. The city's traffic engineer shall determine, based on the nature of the development, additional time periods in which current traffic volumes shall be documented. 
(8)  Estimate future P.M. peak hour traffic volumes for the intersection included in the study area using the recommendations of the city's traffic engineer. 
(9)  Distribute and assign the net development trips through the site driveway(s) plus the nearest collector and arterial street intersections in each direction along streets bordering the development site. If applicable, this and subsequent tasks shall be repeated based on approved land uses and/or land uses identified in the Warrensburg Comprehensive City Plan. 
(10)  Conduct volume/capacity and queuing analyses for the peak hours at site driveway(s) and other intersections using methodologies approved by the ITE and in conjunction with direction from the city traffic engineer on which methods would be most appropriate. Such analyses should be for: 
a.  Existing conditions; 
b.  Existing conditions plus development conditions; and 
c.  Future conditions. 
(11)  Compare existing plus development conditions and future conditions with established city guidelines/policies for acceptable levels of service and turn lane requirements. 
(12)  Identify geometric and traffic control improvements needed to mitigate deficiencies and/or comply with established guidelines for acceptable levels of service. 
(13)  Extend the study, on the request of the city traffic engineer, to additional street segments and/or intersections on the public street system. The city traffic engineer shall make this determination based on the scale, location, and/or nature of the proposed development and the condition or state of development of the street network in the vicinity of the site.

(b)  Direct residential driveway access to individual one-family and two-family dwellings is prohibited on arterial and collector streets. 
(c)  Residential corner lots shall obtain access from the street with the lowest functional classification, and access shall be placed as far from the Intersection as possible to achieve the maximum available corner clearance. 
(d)  Connectivity of supporting streets. New residential subdivisions shall be designed to coordinate with existing, proposed and anticipated streets. 
(1)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the proposed development where such an extension would connect with streets in another existing, platted or planned development. 
(2)  When a proposed development abuts unplatted land or a future development phase of the same development, stub streets shall be provided to provide access to abutting properties or to logically extend the street system into the surrounding areas. All street stubs serving more or other than two (2) residential units shall be provided with a temporary turn-around or cul-de-sac, and the restoration and extension of the street would be the responsibility of any future developer of the abutting land.

(a)  The applicant shall post a performance guaranty in the form of a cash bond, performance bond or letter of credit. The guaranty shall be in such form and amount as is necessary to assure the work, if not completed in accordance with this division, will be corrected. The amount of the performance guaranty shall be determined by the public works director to secure the costs for improvements required by this division, and this amount shall be in addition to any other amounts necessary to secure the faithful performance of other acts required of the permit holder by the city that the performance guaranty is intended to cover. The public works director may grant a partial or complete waiver of the performance guaranty, upon application, for governmental or quasi-governmental entities or state regulated utilities or where the public works director finds minimal impairment of existing surface drainage, minimal erosion hazard, minimal sedimentation hazard upon any adjacent land or watercourse, and no hazard to human life or property. All performance guaranties shall be accompanied by a pledge and performance agreement that shall grant the city the right to enter onto the applicant's property and utilize the security to either complete stormwater control measures or to correct deficiencies in the work to assure compliance with the performance standards set forth in this chapter and in the stormwater design manual. 
(b)  In the event of any alleged default in the performance of any term or condition of the performance guaranty, the city, the surety, the issuing organization or entity, or any person employed or engaged on its behalf has a right to go upon the site or disturbed area to complete the required work necessary to control erosion and sedimentation or to protect properties, watercourses and persons. In the event the city undertakes this work with the funds from a forfeited performance guaranty, the funds must be used to pay the cost of contracting, including engineering and administration, for necessary restoration of the site to control erosion and sediment within the requirements set forth in this division, permit, or performance guaranty. If the cost of the work necessary to control erosion and sediment or to protect properties, watercourses and persons exceeds the amount of the performance guaranty, the permit holder shall continue to be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for payment of all excess costs and expenses incurred by the city. The cost of necessary work in excess of the performance guaranty shall be certified by the city clerk of the City of Warrensburg and shall, to the extent authorized by law, become a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay that cost. The cost of removal shall be listed on the tax bill and be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes to the extent authorized by law. 
(c)  A performance guaranty remains in full force and effect until a completion certificate is issued and all other permit holder's acts covered by the performance guaranty have been determined to be complete in accordance with the applicable city code provisions.

The offsite facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by onsite practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
(d)  The city finds that meeting the minimum onsite management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
(e)  Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: 
(1)  The generation of stormwater from the site; 
(2)  The size and cost of stormwater storage; 
(3)  The pollutants generated at the site. 
    These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the stormwater design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the city. 
    In instances where one (1) of the conditions above applies, the city may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
(a)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(b)  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
(c)  Accelerated stream bank or stream bed erosion or siltation; 
(d)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property. 
    Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one (1) of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
(b)  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this division; 
(c)  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices. 
    Where the city waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the city. 
    When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater authority agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the city, and based on the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of the development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development. 
    In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an offsite stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building permit.

Sec. 20-120.11. - General performance criteria for stormwater management. 
    All structures, measures and devices installed or used for erosion and sediment control practices at a site or disturbed area must, after construction, meet the criteria and performance standards set forth in the stormwater design manual. 
(Ord. No. 4822, § 1, 4-8-13; Ord. No. 5282, § 1, 10-24-16) 
Sec. 20-120.12. - Basic stormwater management design criteria. 
    All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten (10) year, one hundred (100) year) as identified in the current stormwater design manual are met, unless the city grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. 
    In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
    At a minimum, the requirements and performance standards of the stormwater design manual shall be adhered to.

Sec. 20-120.13. - Requirements for stormwater management plan approval. 
    No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be prepared by an individual approved by the city and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices. The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. No building or land disturbance permit shall be issued until a satisfactory stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the city after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this division. Stormwater management plans must meet the requirements of section 20-102 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 4822, § 1, 4-8-13) 
Sec. 20-120.14. - Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
    Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater management facility as one (1) of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this division. The maintenance agreement shall be recorded by the city in the land records. 
    Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance agreement that must be approved by the city and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As part of the agreement, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. The city, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
    All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this division and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include: 
(a)  Removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes; 
(b)  Grass cutting and vegetation removal; and 
(c)  Necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. 
    Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the city, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. 
    Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: 
(a)  Routine inspections; 
(b)  Random inspections; 
(c)  Inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; 
(d)  Inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; 
(e)  Inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and 
(f)  Joint inspection with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Reviewing maintenance and repair records; 
(2)  Sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and 
(3)  Evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
    When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the city the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this division is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this division. 
    Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records permanently. These records shall be made available to the city during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
    If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance agreement, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have ten (10) days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner pursuant to the requirements set forth in section 20-135 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 4822, § 1, 4-8-13) 
Sec. 20-120.15. - Enforcement. 
(a)  The city shall serve a notice of violation upon any person responsible in whole or in part for the construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, or removal of drainage improvements in violation of a building permit, right-of-way permit, land disturbance permit or any permit issued under this Code. In the event work does not conform to the plans and specifications of an approved stormwater pollution prevention plan, this division or to any instructions of the city, a notice of violation shall be served upon the permit holder. The notice of violation shall state the work to be done and the specified period of time by which corrective action shall be completed. After a notice of violation to comply is given, the permit holder shall commence corrective measures within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(b)  The city may require all work on a site or disturbed area which is being performed contrary to the provisions of this division or in an unsafe or dangerous manner, be immediately stopped. The city may issue a notice of violation for the entire project or any specified part thereof if any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Any land disturbance activity regulated under this division is being undertaken without a land disturbance permit. 
(2)  The stormwater pollution prevention plan is not being fully implemented. 
(3)  Any of the conditions of the land disturbance permit are not being met. 
(4)  The work is being performed in a dangerous and unsafe manner. 
(c)  The notice of violation shall be in writing and shall be issued by posting a copy at the site or disturbed area and by serving a copy upon the permit holder. A copy of the notice of violation shall be posted on the site of the land disturbing activity in reasonable proximity to where the land disturbing activity is taking place. In the case of work for which there is a land disturbance permit, a permit holder shall be properly served by mailing a copy of the order by first class mail to the address listed for the permit holder on the permit application. In the case of work for which there is not a land disturbance permit, a copy of the order shall be mailed to the owner of record. In addition, a copy of the notice of violation may be given to any person in charge of or performing work on drainage improvements at the site or disturbed area, or to an agent of any of the foregoing. 
(d)  The notice of violation shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. No person, entity or permit holder shall continue any work after a notice of violation has been issued except such work as is directed to be performed to remove a violation or dangerous or unsafe condition, as provided in the order. 
(e)  Ten (10) days after issuing a notice of violation, the city may issue a notice of intent to the owner of record or permit holder of the city's intent to perform work necessary to comply with these regulations. If the permit holder wishes to contest the city's determination to enter and complete the work at the expense of the permit holder, the permit holder may request a hearing on the matter before the director of public works by requesting the same in writing delivered to the director of public works during the ten-day notice period. If a hearing is requested, the director of public works will, after a hearing on the record, determine whether the permit holder has complied with the provisions of this division, and shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law. If the director of public works determines that the provisions of this chapter have not been complied with, they shall order the permit holder to comply within a period of time specified in the order. Should the permit holder fail to comply within that time, or fail to request a hearing, the city may go on the land and commence work. The costs incurred by the city to perform this work shall be paid by the owner of record or permit holder out of the performance guaranty required by section 20-108 of this Code to the extent the amount is covered thereby, with the remainder being directly due and owing by the owner of record or permit holder. In the event no permit was issued or no performance guaranty was posted, the cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the issuing authority, plus a reasonable administrative fee shall be billed to the owner of record and assessed against the property pursuant to section 13-10 of this Code.

(b)  In any action brought of any special tax bill, the court may correct any error in the amount of the tax bill, and in any case where it is shown that the work done was not as good as required by the contract, the court may give judgment for the reasonable value of the work chargeable against the land described in the special tax bill.

The city council shall adjust or reduce such assessment which is determined to be excessive or levied at a greater sum than was stated in the notices.

In addition, the ROW user shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public lands of the city by any other person. 
(5)  All facilities of the ROW user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of the public right-of-way and public lands. The city, through its director of public works, shall have the right to consult with the ROW user and its agents and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to installation. 
(6)  The ROW user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other ROW users without their permission. If and when the city requires or negotiates to have a provider or ROW user cease using its existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time. The city may waive this requirement when, in its sole discretion, it deems relocation impractical. The cost of such relocation shall be borne in accordance with this article and the applicable tariff or franchise agreement governing that service provider or ROW user. 
(7)  The director of public works, may assign specific corridors within the public right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is currently or, is expected will someday be located within the public right-of-way. All right-of-way permits issued by the city shall indicate the proper corridor for the ROW user's facilities. Any ROW user whose facilities are currently in the public right-of-way in a position at a variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its assigned position within the public right-of-way, unless this agreement is waived by the director of public works, for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, user service needs and hardship to the ROW user. 
(8)  If, in the preparation and planning of a public right-of-way project, the director of public works may require directional boring and the use of a single facility conduit in connection with crossing of existing street improvements or when open trenching would endanger public safety or property adjacent to the public right-of-way. 
(9)  All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements, public facilities or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the ROW user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the ROW user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city. Upon determination by the director of public works, that such repair or replacement is a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be corrected within twenty-four (24) hours of notice from the city. The director of public works may direct the city or its contractors or agents to make such repair or replacement and bill the ROW user for the city's cost. The director of public works, has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the ROW user to do any necessary additional work. 
(10)  All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of a ROW user's facilities in the public right-of-way shall be in accordance with applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, including those promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the ROW user. 
(11)  All facilities shall be constructed and all facilities work shall be completed, in accordance with the city's standard construction specifications. A ROW user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the public right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the director of public works, and having received a right-of-way permit for such improvement. The director of public works, may require that any drawings, plans and/or specifications submitted be certified by a qualified professional stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes. 
(12)  The ROW user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and location of its facilities within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the city or its authorized agent for a public improvement or work upon or to a public facility. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROW user without any expense to the city, its employees, agents or authorized contractors.

Sec. 20-206. - Insurance, performance guarantees and remedies. 
(a)  Performance and maintenance bond. 
(1)  Unless a right-of-way user can demonstrate that it holds twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance with this chapter, then the right-of-way user must maintain a surety bond to guarantee compliance with this chapter and completion of the facilities work, including the maintenance guarantee, in an amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or the cost of restoration of the right-of-way for the facilities work undertaken, whichever is greater.

(6)  Recovery by the city of any amounts under the performance and maintenance bond or otherwise does not limit an applicant's duty to indemnify the city in any way, nor shall such recovery relieve an applicant of its obligations under a right-of-way permit or reduce the amounts owed to the city other than by the amounts recovered by the city under the performance bond, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. 
(7)  No ROW user who can demonstrate that it possesses twenty-five million dollars in net assets and has had no history of non-compliance with this chapter shall be required to provide a bond hereunder, provided however that a ROW user must have completed work under at least one right-of-way permit to qualify under this provision.

(h)  Right-of-way vacation. If the city vacates a public right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the service provider's facilities, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all service providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such vacated public right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 21-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  The platting of land is the first step in the process of urban development. The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks, drainage ways and utility easements will determine to a large degree the design, character and conditions in the urban area. The quality of the urban area is of public interest. These regulations and standards for the platting and subdividing of land for urban use are to make provision for adequate light, air, open space, drainage, traffic circulation, utilities and other needs, to insure the development and maintenance of a healthy, attractive and efficient community. 
(b)  These regulations are designed to: 
(1)  Implement the city plan adopted by the planning and zoning commission; 
(2)  Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the spread of urban blight; 
(3)  Provide that the cost of improvement which primarily benefit the tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract.

Sec. 21-26. - Purpose. 
    The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design of the individual plats and subdivisions that compose it. Therefore, the design of each plat shall be prepared in accordance with the objectives established by the adopted city plan for land use, traffic circulation, and utility services. The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system shall be designated to make the most advantageous use of existing topography and natural physical features including tree masses and large individual trees. Adjacent properties should be considered in the plat design and shall not be landlocked. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(3.1), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-27. - Blocks. 
(a)  Length. Intersecting streets, which determine block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to provide adequate access and to meet existing streets in the neighborhood. In residential districts, where no existing plats are recorded, the blocks shall not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in length except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrian ways or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block by the planning and zoning commission. Such pedestrian ways or easements shall have minimum width of ten (10) feet. Blocks for business use should normally not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length. 
(b)  Widths. Residential plats, interior blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted for exterior blocks which border the plat boundary or blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways. Blocks intended for commercial or industrial use shall be of such width and depth as may be considered most suitable for the prospective business. 
(c)  Large blocks. When a tract is platted for subdividing into larger than normal building lots and blocks, such parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical platting with provisions for adequate easements for streets and utilities. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(3.2), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-28. - Streets. 
(a)  Major streets. Arterial and collector streets through plats shall conform with the city's major street plan. Wherever a plat abuts or is divided by a major street, designated by the city plan whether any part thereof has or has not been dedicated or used by the public, the developer shall dedicate any lands within such plat which are necessary to provide conformity with the major street plan. Such dedication shall be shown on the plat, and the developer shall receive no compensation for such dedication. 
(b)  Local streets. Local streets shall be so designated to provide access to each lot or parcel of land and in a manner that will discourage use by through or nonlocal traffic. 
(c)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall normally be no longer than five hundred (500) feet, and shall terminate in circular paved space having a minimum radius of thirty-seven and one-half (371/2) feet to outside of pavement or curb. 
(d)  Right angle intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be sixty (60) degrees. 
(e)  Frontage roads. Whenever a plat abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, railroad or nonresidential land use, the planning and zoning commission may require frontage roads, screen plantings, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(f)  Half-streets. Dedication of half-streets will not be approved, except where it is in conformity with the approved major street plan and is essential to the reasonable development of the plat. 
(g)  Minimum dimensions. All streets included in any plat, hereafter dedicated and accepted, shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows:

(h)  Street grades. The grades of streets included in any plat shall not be greater than eight (8) percent. 
(i)  Street alignment. Minimum horizontal and vertical alignment on all streets, except in unusual cases, shall be as follows: 
(1)  Horizontal alignment-Radii at the centerline: 
Major streets-300 feet. 
Local streets-100 feet. 
A tangent shall be provided between all reversed curves to provide for a smooth flow of traffic. 
(2)  Vertical alignment. All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of such length as to provide for desirable sight distance. 
(j)  Street jogs. Streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be avoided. 
(k)  Street names. Street names shall not duplicate or be similar so as to be confused for the names of existing streets. Streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the same names. 
(l)  Adjoining street system. If, where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the developer, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for unplatted portion shall be prepared and submitted by the developer. Where it is obvious a street from another development should continue across the planned development the plan shall provide for continuation of this street through the development.

Sec. 21-29. - Alleys. 
    Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that the requirements may be waived where other definite and assured provisions are made for service access to off-street loading and unloading areas and to off-street parking areas, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Dead end alleys shall be avoided wherever possible. Alleys may be required in certain residential areas. Alleys shall have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet.

Cross reference- One-way streets and alleys, § 23-226 et seq. 
Sec. 21-30. - Easements. 
(a)  On every plat, permanent utility easements dedicated to the city shall be provided, other than along streets, through each block to logically serve every future lot, tract or parcel. When utility easements cross streets they shall align for at least fifty (50) feet on either side of the street right-of-way. All utility easements shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide or of greater width if necessary for proper installation of services. Utility easement requirements may be waived by the planning and zoning commission when alleys are provided for the placement of utility services. 
(b)  Any person, firm or entity causing property to be platted such that existing public utility facilities are not located within the newly platted public right-of-way or utility easements shall be responsible for all costs associated with relocating those facilities into newly platted utility easements or public right-of-way. 
(c)  Any public utility providing service within the city may file with the city facilities plans or other documents that demonstrate a need for public utility corridors other than those required by subsection (a) above, and the city may require the developer to dedicate to the city such other utility easements as may be necessary to the orderly operation of public utility systems. 
(d)  All utility installations shall be made in compliance with the provisions of section 20-201 et seq. No public utility shall be forced to bear the cost of relocating its facilities from a corridor designated as a public utility easement in connection with public improvements so long as the facilities as originally installed were in compliance with the provisions of section 20-201 et seq. at the time of installation. It shall be the sole responsibility of the utility to verify location within a public right-of-way or public utility easement. Nothing herein shall relieve a public utility of its duty to relocate facilities from public right-of-way when public improvements require such relocation.

Sec. 21-31. - Drainage ways. 
(a)  Drainage easements shall be required in addition to other easements, where a plat is crossed by a water course, drainage channel or stream. When the natural drainage area in and above the plat is eighty (80) acres or larger, drainage ways shall be provided by the developer. The drainage easement shall include all land within the plat that has an elevation below the one hundred (100) year maximum flood elevation. The run-off shall be calculated at a rate equal to the total urban development of the drainage area. 
(b)  Where surface drainage on residential lots is necessary, easements shall be provided and the city may require installation of pipe, masonry or rip-rap flumes, or such other protective devices in order that adjacent or surrounding property or the welfare of the public shall not be endangered and maintenance will be kept at a minimum. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(3.6), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-32. - Parks. 
    All developers are urged to consider the dedication of land for park, recreation and public use. When the city plan indicates a park, playground or school in a proposed plat, the developer shall duly consider the public needs and reserve such sites until the appropriate public boards have had an opportunity to negotiate terms of purchase, trade, dedication or any combination thereof with the developer.

Sec. 21-33. - Lots. 
(a)  Every lot shall be designed to provide a satisfactory and desirable building site and shall abut on a street and a utility easement. In a planned unit development, each lot shall be granted access to a public street through the common property. Utility easements shall be provided as necessary for each lot in the development. 
(b)  The minimum lot width shall be fifty (50) feet; except where additional width is required either by the zoning regulations, or the lack of public utilities (water or sewer), or a corner lot where a front yard is required on both streets. 
(c)  The minimum lot depth shall be one hundred (100) feet, except where additional depth is required either by the zoning regulations or the lack of public utilities, water or sewer. 
(d)  Minimum area shall be subject to the zoning regulations of the district in which the subdivision is located, and by the following utility service requirements: 
(1)  In subdivisions where septic tank or other individual sewerage disposal devices are to be installed, the size of all lots shall be determined by soil percolation tests, but in no cases shall lots be less than one-half acre in size. The percolation tests shall be made by a registered professional engineer and in conformance with standards of the state department of natural resources. The lots shall be so proportioned as to permit future replatting consistent with good subdivision design. 
(2)  In subdivisions where water supply is by private wells, the size of all lots included in the subdivision shall be a minimum of one-half acre said lots shall be so proportioned that future replatting will be consistent with good subdivision design. 
(3)  If the proposed subdivision is not served with a public water system or a public sanitary sewer system, and the subdivider proposes to use individual septic tanks and wells for the lots in the subdivision, the size of each lot shall be determined by soil percolation tests. The percolation tests shall be made by a registered professional engineer and in conformance with the state department of natural resources. In no case shall lots be less than two and one-half (21/2) acres in size. The lots shall be so proportioned as to permit future replatting consistent with good subdivision design. 
(e)  All side lot lines shall bear sixty (60) to ninety (90) degrees from the street right-of-way line on a straight street or from a perpendicular of the tangent of a curved street. 
(f)  Corner lots, in residential subdivisions, shall have additional width or depth in order that the same setback on both streets may be observed. 
(g)  Double frontage lots shall be avoided unless, in the opinion of the planning commission, a variation to this rule will give better street alignment and lot arrangement. 
(h)  Residential lots shall front upon local streets or frontage roads rather than major streets whenever possible. 
(i)  Building or setback lines shall be shown on the preliminary and final maps for all lots in the subdivision and shall not be less than the setback required by the zoning ordinance. 
(j)  The subdivision or resubdivision of a tract, bloc or lot shall not be permitted where it would create a lot or parcel, or place an existing structure in violation of the requirements of the zoning ordinance.

ARTICLE III. - PLAT PREPARATION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 21-51. - Purpose. 
    This article is intended to avoid confusion or undue hardships for either the developer or the planning and zoning commission during the platting process. A step-by-step procedure for platting and subdividing land is outlined for the developer and the planning and zoning commission. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(7.1), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-52. - Land division. 
(a)  A landowner with a parcel of land, platted or unplatted, who desires to split the parcel into two (2) or more tracts, any one (1) of which is less than five (5) acres, must plat and obtain plat approval. 
(b)  All plats which have not received approval in the preliminary stage, as set forth herein, or previously recorded, at the time of passage of this chapter shall be subject to all of its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(1.5), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-53. - Pre-application procedure. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the pre-application procedure is to provide for an informal review of a proposed subdivision with the developer and appropriate city officials. This informal review will give the developer an opportunity to become familiar with plat and subdivision regulations and to secure guidance as to what will be required before incurring substantial expense in making detailed plans. 
(b)  Pre-application conference. A developer contemplating the development of a new subdivision will request a pre-application review conference with the city subdivision review team. The subdivision review team shall consist of the city manager, the director of public works, the building official, the fire chief and the city's planning adviser. 
(c)  Proposed plat. The developer should prepare and bring to the conference a rough sketch of the proposed subdivision together with notations as to the following principal features of the location: 
(1)  General reference to boundaries of proposed subdivision; 
(2)  General topographic conditions, including highest and lowest points, natural drainage ways, streams and water bodies; 
(3)  Forest or wooded areas; 
(4)  Existing buildings; 
(5)  Proposed street layout; 
(6)  General location and types of land uses to be developed. 
(Ord. No. 1814, § 2(7.2), 9-12-77) 
Sec. 21-54. - Plat and subdivision procedure. 
    The steps contained in this section shall be followed for all subdividing, resubdividing, platting and replatting of land in the city. 
    Step 1. The developer shall file the following with the City of Warrensburg: 
(1)  Fourteen (14) copies of the preliminary plat as described by these regulations; 
(2)  A filing fee as set by resolution of the city council; 
(3)  A formal irrevocable offer of the owner for dedication to public use of all streets, alleys, parks, public lands, shown thereon, and the granting of all easements required; 
(4)  A statement on the plat which states that when the city accepts the street right-of-way shown on the plat as property, the city is under no obligation to improve the streets or to accept the streets for public maintenance. 
    Step 2. The city planner will advise other concerned city departments and entities, of the proposed subdivision, requesting their review and comments. The developer shall submit copies of the preliminary plat to each public utility including gas, electric, water, cable, and telephone. Proof of such delivery shall be submitted to the city. Each public utility shall have thirty (30) days from the date of delivery in which to provide written comment to the city on the preliminary plat, together with any proposed alterations to public utility easements and right-of-way. 
    Step 3. The planning and zoning commission, at the next regular meeting occurring forty (40) days or more after the preliminary plat, and all accompanying documents are filed shall consider the plat. The commission shall arrive at a decision on the preliminary plat within sixty (60) days of the first meeting, except the commission with the consent of the developer may extend the sixty-day period. 
(1)  If approved by the commission or approved with conditions, the plat shall be sent to the city council together with any comments or conditions in writing for tentative approval and acceptance by the city; or 
(2)  If the commission cannot reach a decision within the time period, the developer may proceed to Step 4; or 
(3)  If disapproved, the commission shall provide a written statement to the developer stating the grounds for disapproval addressing: 
a.  Plat subdivision requirements; 
b.  Current zoning requirements; 
c.  The major street plan, as adopted; 
d.  The intent of the adopted city plan; 
e.  Other pertinent considerations. 
    Step 4. The city council shall review all preliminary plats completing Step 3(1) or stalled at Step 3(2) or Step 3(3). The city council shall consider the preliminary plat and the comments and conditions of the commission and may tentatively approve the preliminary plat, tentatively approve the plat with conditions, or may disapprove the plat. Any vote of the city council to remove a recommended condition or approve a plat disapproved by the commission shall require four-fifths approval for passage. The tentatively approved plat constitutes an acceptance of the plat including rights-of-way for streets, alleys, easements, drainage ways and land dedicated for public use, but does not include improvements such as utilities, street paving or the proposed subdividing of blocks into lots. Within ninety (90) days, prior to recording of a final plat the developer shall submit a revised preliminary plat incorporating all conditions required by the city council. 
    Step 5. The developer shall proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
    Step 6. The developer shall file the following with the City of Warrensburg: 
(1)  Fourteen (14) copies of the final subdivision plat and two (2) complete sets of construction drawings and specifications of the public improvements at the one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet scale; 
(2)  A filing fee as set by resolution of the city council. 
    Step 7. At least forty (40) days prior to consideration by the commission, the developer shall cause copies of the final plat to be submitted to each public utility, including gas, electric, water, cable and telephone. Proof of such delivery shall be submitted to the city. Each public utility shall have thirty (30) days from the date of delivery in which to provide written comment to the city on the final plat. 
    Step 8. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the final subdivision plat or proposed development within forty (40) days after the filing of the final plat with the city and arrive at a decision within forty (40) days of the first meeting. If disapproved, the commission shall state in writing the reasons for its disapproval and refer specifically to those parts of the city plan, the zoning ordinance or this chapter to which the plat or subdivision does not comply. After its decision, the commission shall forward the matter in writing to the city council for final consideration. If disapproved by the commission, a final plat may still be approved by city council upon approval by four-fifths of its members. 
    Step 9. Prior to approval of the final plat by the city council, the developer shall agree in writing, in a form provided by the City of Warrensburg, that he will: 
(1)  Install the required improvements in accordance with city standards prior to being issued a building permit. The construction and installation of required improvements may be to each lot for which a building permit is requested; however, no building permit shall be issued for construction on any lot within any subdivision until construction and installation of required improvements have been completed within the subdivision for and to the lot for which the building permit is to be issued; or 
(2)  Provide a performance bond or escrow account, set up according to terms of the city, in an amount sufficient to ensure satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the required improvements. If an escrow account is chosen by the developer, estimates of completed improvements may be presented to the city council together with a request for release of funds in the amount of completed improvements. Upon certification by the City of Warrensburg that such improvements have been completed to city standards and specifications, the city council may release that portion of funds in the escrow account. Before final withdrawal of funds from the escrow account, the developer shall certify to the city that all bills have been paid for materials and work on the required improvements. 
Building permits will be issued to any lot or area for which improvements have been completed and once a performance bond or escrow account has been established in accordance with Step 9(2). In those cases where a performance bond or escrow account has been posted and the required improvements have not been installed within two (2) years, the city may thereupon declare the developer to be in default and require that all improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time of default. 
    Step 10. The city council shall review the plat or subdivision and report of the planning and zoning commission and may give its final approval of the subdivision and acceptance of streets and improvements. 
    Step 11. Upon approval, the developer shall submit upon acceptable mylar stock two (2) original drawings of the approved plat, bearing original signatures by all persons claiming an interest in the property by all applicable taxing authorities certifying that no taxes are owed on the property, and by the licensed surveyor preparing the plat. The approval of the final subdivision plat shall be shown over the signature of the mayor and attested to by the city clerk on the original drawing. After approval, the city clerk shall file the plat with the county recorder's office. The recording fee shall be paid by the city and the city shall provide as many copies of the filing certification as requested by the developer.

a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection of, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown. 
b.  The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the state highway commission with reference to an intersection involving a state highway, and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require, and this prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this article, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

(c)  Immediate notification required if any permanently prohibited discharge is accidentally discharged to a sewer. Any person causing or being aware of the release of a permanently prohibited discharge to a city sewer (sanitary sewer or storm sewer) must immediately notify the City of Warrensburg Water Pollution Control Division (Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., or after hours; weekend and holidays sewer emergency number at 660-747-9131, and follow the instructions for the sewer department, this action will automatically page the water pollution control department emergency standby crew. The notification shall include the name of caller, location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, best possible estimates of concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken. Upon verification of concentration and volume, the permittee shall inform the City of Warrensburg of actual values. 
(d)  Control authority to determine need for prevention plan; elements of plan. When the control authority determines that a user is contributing to the POTW, any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the control authority shall (a) advise the user of the impact of the contribution of the POTW, and (b) develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference with the POTW, and (c) evaluate need for hazardous waste notification to determine whether such users need a plan to handle and prevent accidental spills or nonroutine batch discharges. If the control authority decides that such a plan is warranted, it must contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for promptly notifying the POTW of slug discharges as defined under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days; 
(4)  Any necessary procedures to prevent accidental spills, including maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, and control of plant site run-off; 
(5)  Any necessary measures for building any containment structures or equipment; 
(6)  Any necessary measures for controlling toxic organics (including solvents); 
(7)  Any necessary procedures and equipment for emergency response; 
(8)  Any necessary follow-up practices to limit the damage suffered by the treatment plant or the environment. 
(e)  Options of the control authority. If substances enumerated above are introduced to the wastewater treatment system which in the judgment of the control authority may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the control authority may: 
(1)  Reject the waste; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over quantities and rates of discharges; 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of subsection (i). 
[If] the control authority permits the pretreatment or equalization of wastes flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall also be subject to the review and approval of the control authority, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(f)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the control authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the control authority and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(g)  Preliminary treatment. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(h)  Control structure. When required by the control authority, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the control authority. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(i)  Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in the article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by EPA. 
(k)  Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The control authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The control authority may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the control authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; and 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any accidental or slug. 
Discharge, as required in sections 24-21(c) and 24-54(g), (h), (j), and (k) of this chapter. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

(c)  The winter month average volume shall be calculated each year and the new average used on the monthly bills with the first month following the March billing cycles. The same charge shall remain in effect for twelve (12) months after which the average is calculated again. 
(d)  If a residential user has not established a winter month's average, the volume charge until the winter month's average is established shall be based upon the lessor of the actual monthly water usage rate for that billing cycle for that residential unit, or eight hundred (800) cubic feet. For any new sewer customer that does not receive water service from Missouri American water or its successor, the sewer customer shall notify the city of the new service within ten (10) days of establishing residency at the service address. Failing such notification and receipt of usage information as called for herein, the bills shall be issued in the name "occupant," and the owner of the property held responsible for any delinquency pursuant to RSMo 250.140, and as the same may be amended. 
(e)  If a customer uses sufficient amount of water which is not discharged into the sewer system, such user may obtain a separate water meter for the water used for non-sewer purposes and exempt such meter from sewer charges. 
(f)  Any customer that experiences a water leak, improper plumbing or other situation that may provide proof of a water usage not capable of being monitored by a separate water meter as provided in subsection (e) above may, within fifteen (15) days of the billing date, seek a credit adjustment to their bill on a form provided by the city. Documentation must be submitted with the request. Only one (1) such adjustment per life of an account will be considered.

Sec. 24-54. - Regulations. 
(a)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this ordinance [division] for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this ordinance [division]. The control authority shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. These requirements are in the industrial pretreatment plan, that the city will maintain, and shall be presented to the categorical user in the wastewater discharge permit issued by the control authority. 
(b)  Food service establishments. FSE shall follow the Sewer Use Ordinance Pretreatment Program to include the City of Warrensburg approved Fats, Oil and Grease Policy and Training Handbook. 
(c)  Specific pollutant limitations. Based on the loading capabilities of the POTW's, local limits are specific to each categorical industry. These limits are presented in the industries wastewater discharge permit. 
    No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of: 
1.0 mg/l arsenic 
1.5 mg/l cadmium 
4.0 mg/l copper 
1.0 mg/l cyanide 
1.0 mg/l lead 
0.1 mg/l mercury 
4.0 mg/l nickel 
1.0 mg/l silver 
6.0 mg/l total chromium 
4.0 mg/l zinc 
(d)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this ordinance [division]. 
(e)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 24-21 of this article. 
(f)  Excessive discharge.

b.  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(10)  Periodic compliance reports. 
a.  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the control authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. Sampling for all periodic compliance reports must be performed during the period covered by the report. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceed the average daily flow reported in section 24-56(d)(2)(e). If any pollutant required to be tested for in the wastewater discharge permit is monitored more frequently than required by said permit, the results of such monitoring shall be submitted to the City of Warrensburg. All users are required to submit documentation annually to determine compliance with best management practices [40 CFR 403.12 (b), (e), (h)]. At the discretion of the control authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the control authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. 
b.  The city may impose mass limitations on users in cases where such imposition is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by section 24-56(e)(2) shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the control authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard and set forth in the wastewater discharge permit issued to the categorical industrial user. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Additionally, sampling techniques for categorical industries shall adhere to revisions set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(5). Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. 
(11)  Violations. Users shall report all violations of their wastewater discharge permits to the city within twenty-four (24) hours. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. In addition, the sampling and analysis must be repeated and the results submitted to the city within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the violation. If the violation of their discharge permit involves a slug load, immediate notification to the city must be carried out. During normal business hours Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. the City of Warrensburg should be notified by telephone (660-747-6923). At all other times the City of Warrensburg should be notified by telephone via the city's sewer emergency line (660-747-9131) and follow the instructions for the sewer department, this action will automatically page the water pollution control department emergency standby crew. The notification shall include the name of caller, location of discharge, date, and time thereof, type of waste, best possible estimates of concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken. Upon verification of concentration and volume the permittee shall inform the City of Warrensburg of actual values. 
(12)  Record-keeping requirements. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of Warrensburg, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the control authority. 
(13)  Monitoring facilities. The city shall require, to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities and equipment to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and properly operating condition at the expense of the user. 
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city.

(14)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being complied with. 
The director of public works and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority and/or his duly authorized employee's ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
a.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director of public works and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities; 
b.  The city, approval authority and EPA bearing proper credentials and identification shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations; 
c.  The control authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated using manufacturers recommendations to ensure their accuracy; 
d.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user; 
e.  Unreasonable delays in allowing control authority and/or his duly authorized employees access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division; 
f.  If the monitoring facility is constructed in the public right-of way or easement, it shall be in an unobstructed location. The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the control authority requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the control authority to perform independent monitoring activities. 
(15)  Control of slug discharges. The city shall evaluate SIU's once within one (1) year of becoming an SIU to determine if a need exists for a plan to control slug discharges.

If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling, and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(16)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this ordinance [division] and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this ordinance [division]. Any subsequent change in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(17)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information divulges information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this ordinance [division], the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(18)  Publication of violations. The City of Warrensburg shall publish, at least annually, in the newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW of industrial users which, at any time during the past twelve (12) months, were in significant non-compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. A significant industrial user (or industrial user) is in significant non-compliance if its violations meet one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(a)  Violations of wastewater discharge limits. 
1.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1); 
2.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease (FOG), and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
3.  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average, instan- 
taneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
4.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(B) [of 40 CFR Section 403.8] to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
5.  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

Sec. 24-57. - Enforcement. 
    Any person who violates any requirement of this ordinance shall be subject to civil and criminal penalties as described herein. 
    Enforcement of violations is in accordance with the enforcement response plan of the City of Warrensburg's industrial pretreatment program as the same may be amended from time to time. This document lists possible violations and a hierarchy of enforcement options for such violations. 
(1)  Control authority inspection and sampling of significant industrial users. The control authority will randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing non-compliance with pretreatment standards, and inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. 
The control authority will also evaluate, at least once every two (2) years, whether each such significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. The results of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. If the control authority decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the elements required in section 24-56(e)(2)(g). 
(2)  Harmful contribution. The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference with the POTW, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including but not limited to immediate severance of water service and if deemed necessary the sewer connection, services will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactory demonstrated its ability to comply. This is to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system and/or endangerment to the health and welfare of the community, employees and the environment. The city shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. 
(3)  Revocation of permit. Any user who violates this division, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of section 24-57 of this ordinance [division] for: 
a.  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
b.  Failure of a user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
d.  Violation of conditions of the permit. 
(4)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this ordinance [division], wastewater contribution permit, conditions or any prohibition or limitation of requirements contained herein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. A plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation shall be submitted to the city by the user within ten (10) days from the date of the notice of violation. Until final compliance has been achieved the user will be considered in violation of the ordinance. 
(5)  Show cause hearing. 
a.  Service of notice. The control authority, as stipulated in the enforcement response plan, may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city administrator, the director of public works and other involved members of the control authority why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of the hearing to be held regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the city administrator, director of public works and involved members of the control authority why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
b.  Conduct of hearing. The director of public works, or his designee, shall conduct the hearing, take evidence, and make findings of fact, and may issue in the name of the city notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings. 
c.  Record of hearing. At any hearing held pursuant to this ordinance [division], testimony taken must be under oath and recorded steno-graphically. The transcript will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the costs of transcription and copying. 
d.  Order to abate. After the director of public works has reviewed the evidence and findings of fact, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer usage be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities and such are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(6)  Legal action. The control authority shall have legal authority and procedures to enforce all requirements in 40 CFR 403 National Pretreatment Program, the City of Warrensburg Code of Ordinances, and the city's pretreatment program enforcement response plan. 
If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this ordinance [division], or any orders issued under the authority contained in this ordinance [division], the city counselor may commence an action for appropriate legal and equitable relief.

    The city council of the City of Warrensburg hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  New growth results in new connections to the city's sewer system, placing an increased demand upon sewer service facilities, in excess of the sewer system's current capabilities in certain service areas throughout the city. 
(2)  The city continues to examine the additional sewer improvements that are needed to serve particular service areas in the city and has segregated projects and costs attributable to existing development and development in each service area. 
(3)  To the extent that development will place additional demand upon sewer system facilities, that demand should be met by shifting the responsibility for financing such facilities from the general public to the developments creating the demand. 
(4)  The imposition of sewer improvement fees will help ensure that developments bear a proportionate share of the cost of sewer facilities necessary to accommodate developments in each service area. 
(5)  The sewer improvements necessary to accommodate development in a particular service area have a rational nexus to and provide benefit to development because the sewer improvements increase the supply and transmission capacity of the sewer system, making service to development possible. 
(6)  In a public election regarding the issuance of sewer bonds, the public expressed support for payments made by developments to pay for their proportionate share of sewer improvements. 
(7)  The council has considered the matter of financing sewer improvements, the need for which is necessitated by development. The council hereby finds and declares that a sewer improvement fee imposed upon development to finance sewer improvements in particular service areas, the need for which is reasonably related to development, furthers the public health, safety and welfare of Warrensburg. Therefore, the council deems it advisable to adopt sewer improvement fees. 
(8)  The city assumes responsibility for and is committed to providing sewer service facilities necessary to serve existing connections through finding mechanisms other than sewer improvement fees. 
(Ord. No. 4249, § 1, 5-14-07; Ord. No. 5380, § 1(Att.), 10-23-17) 
Sec. 24-60.2. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is the intent of this division to impose a sewer improvement fee, payable prior to the approval of a final plat in a particular service area, in an amount based upon the land area of the proposed development. 
(b)  It is the intent of this division that, by establishment of this system of calculating and imposing sewer improvement fees, development in a particular service area will pay its pro rata share of reasonably anticipated costs of sewer service facilities required to serve the property where development is proposed and that the fees paid with respect to each development are roughly proportionate to the proposed development and the property being developed. 
(c)  It is the intent of this division to establish an appeal procedure to allow for an individualized determination that the sewer improvement fee imposed on each new connection is roughly proportionate to the demand that the new connection will place on sewer service facilities. 
(d)  It is the intent of this division that the sewer service facilities financed through the sewer improvement fees established hereby be based, when applicable, upon the city's comprehensive plan and capital improvement program. 
(e)  This division shall not be construed to authorize imposition of a sewer improvement fee for sewer service improvements attributable to existing development. 
(f)  It is the intent of this division to establish a sewer system user's fee, imposed upon development in a particular service area, and not to levy a "tax" or "fee" as such term is used in Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution. 
(g)  It is the intent of this division to establish a system of user's fees, as "user's fees" are interpreted in Missouri case law, that will be used to pay for the cost of providing sewer service facilities, the demand for which is generated by development. The amount of the user's fee to be paid by development is calculated to be proportionate to the land area occupied by such development in each service area. This section is specifically designed so as not to establish a "tax" or "fee" as such terms are used in Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, but rather as a mechanism to equitably shift the burden of the cost of such facilities from the existing general public (which has already paid its fair share of the cost of the existing sewer system improvements and which will continue to pay for the cost of improvements to serve existing connections, maintenance, and repair, through funds other than those derived from this system of user's fees) to development that will generate the need for sewer service facilities that will be constructed with monies derived from this system of user's fees. The monies collected from imposition of this system of user's fees are to be used to offset the cost of providing sewer service to development in the form of sewer service facilities. The monies may not be paid into the city's general fund to defray customary governmental expenditures. In addition, the system is designed so that the user's fee: 
(1)  Is paid upon the approval of designated development applications, and not periodically; 
(2)  Is required to be expended for the provision of sewer facilities that directly benefit the land on which development is proposed within a reasonable period of time from the date such fee is paid; 
(3)  Is directly proportional in amount to the sewer facilities provided; and 
(4)  Is for a service that has not been historically provided exclusively by monies derived from taxes.

Sec. 24-60.7. - Sewer improvement fees for the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area. 
(a)  Additional findings. 
(1)  The council finds that the construction of a sewer interceptor line to serve the Northeast Service Area, including the eastern portion of that service area which contains approximately four hundred twenty-one (421) acres of developable area (the "East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area"), is the most cost efficient manner to provide sewerage service to that service area. 
(2)  In calculating the cost per acre of land in the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area, staff has accounted for and credited to each property other fees to be paid by all development in the service area. 
(3)  Improvements in the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area are needed to serve future development in that area that will result in increased demand upon sewer service facilities, in excess of the sewer system's current capabilities. 
(4)  Data, estimates and calculations supporting the sewer improvement fee for the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area are as follows: 
a.  The total engineering and construction costs of the sewer improvements that have been built to serve the Northeast Service Area in its entirety are six hundred forty-five thousand one hundred eighty-six dollars ($645,186.00). The total cost of that portion of the built sewer improvements that provide capacity to serve only the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area has been calculated by engineers for the city to be three hundred ninety-three thousand dollars ($393,000.00). 
b.  The total gross developable land area in the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area is approximately four hundred twenty-one (421) acres. This area measurement includes an estimate of the undevelopable areas in the East Subdrainage Basin of the service area. 
(5)  For the purposes set forth in section 24-60.1 and this section, the council finds that it is necessary to impose a sewer improvement fee in the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area. 
(b)  Service area. The fee imposed pursuant to this section shall apply to the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area as specified on a map prepared by the public works department, a copy of which shall be maintained on file in the city clerk's office with the ordinance adopting this division. 
(c)  Fee rates. 
(1)  The sewer improvement fee for the East Subdrainage Basin of the Northeast Service Area shall be imposed at the following fee rates per gross acre of the development: 
Type of Land Use Applicable Zoning Districts Fee Rate per Gross Acre Residential R-1, R-1 PUD, R-2, R-2 PUD, R-3, R-3 PUD, R-4, R-4 PUD, R-MH, R-MH PUD $513.00 Commercial NB, NB PUD, BO, BO POD, CB, CB PUD, GB, GB PUD $513.00 Industrial LI, LI PUD, HI, HI PUD $513.00  
(2)  The type of land use in each development shall be determined by zoning classifications, as set forth in the table above. All area within a development that is devoted to common improvements such as streets, alleys, private parks, bodies of water that are created for the development, stormwater drainage areas and tracts that are devoted to open space, shall be included in the calculation of gross acres for the applicable land use based on the zoning classification of such areas.

Sec. 27-28. - Nonconforming situations. 
(a)  Definitions. 
    Dimensional nonconformity. A nonconforming situation that occurs when the height, size, or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. 
    Nonconforming lot. A lot existing at the effective date of this chapter that does not meet the minimum area requirements or dimensional requirements of the district in which the lot is located. 
    Nonconforming situation. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of this chapter, an existing lot or structure does not conform to one (1) or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum area requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as setback requirements) is not in conformity with this chapter. 
    Nonconforming use. A nonconforming use occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. A lawful use of a residential structure which is in existence at the time of passage of this chapter shall not be considered a nonconforming use so long as the existing use is not abandoned or discontinued. If the existing use is thereafter abandoned or discontinued as provided under subsections (f) or (g), the structure shall be deemed to be nonconforming for all purposes. 
(b)  Continuation of nonconforming situations, nonconforming uses, completion of nonconforming projects, and exceptions to nonconformity. 
(1)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this section, nonconforming situations and nonconforming uses that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued. 
(2)  Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or designated use of a building, structure, or other project for which a building permit has been issued and the construction of which shall have begun and been diligently pursued within one hundred eighty (180) days of June 22, 1992 so long as the project shall be completed according to the terms of the permit. 
(c)  Use of nonconforming lots. 
(1)  A nonconforming lot which can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum area set forth in the district regulations, may be used for uses permitted in the regulations for the applicable zoning district in which the lot is located, as though the lot contained the minimum area required for use within that district. 
(2)  A nonconforming lot which can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum dimensions set forth in the district regulations, may be used for uses permitted in the regulations for the applicable zoning district in which the lot is located, as though the lot contained the minimum dimensions required for use within that district. 
(3)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot be reasonably complied with, then the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that: 
a.  The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations; and 
b.  These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and 
c.  The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(4)  For purposes of subsection (3)b. above, compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(d)  Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations and nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Except as specifically provided for in this subsection, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land in all uses, is unlawful if such activity results in: 
a.  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or nonconforming situation; or 
b.  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions (i.e., setback requirements, height limitations or off-street parking). 
(2)  A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(3)  A nonconforming use of open land shall not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming. 
(4)  The intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in the kinds of activities involved and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur. 
(e)  Repair, maintenance and reconstruction. 
(1)  No building which has been damaged by any means, including, but not limited to, neglect, deliberate demolition, fire, explosion, windstorm or other casualty or act of God, to the extent that the cost of repairs equals or exceeds seventy-five (75) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, shall be restored except in conformity with the regulations of this chapter, and all rights to continue the nonconforming situation or nonconforming use are terminated. 
(2)  If a building sustains such damage to the extent that the cost of repairs is less than seventy-five (75) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, it may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repairs or reconstruction are substantially completed within twelve (12) months of the date of such damage. 
(3)  For purposes of this section, "cost of repairs" means the total estimated cost of all labor and materials required to restore the structure to its condition immediately prior to the damage or neglect. 
(4)  Routine and incidental repairs and maintenance, or replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, fixtures, electrical wiring or plumbing, may be made to any nonconforming situation or nonconforming use. 
(f)  Change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists. 
(1)  A change in use shall be permitted only if the intended change is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located. 
(2)  A change in use of property, where a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use exists, that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning authorization or conditional use permit may not be made except in accordance with subsections (c) through (e). 
(3)  If all requirements of this chapter applicable to the proposed use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make initial use of a vacant lot. 
(4)  If all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to the proposed use cannot be reasonably complied with, then the change is permissible if the permit-issuing authority for that particular use issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that: 
a.  The intended change will not result in a violation of subsection (c) of this section; and 
b.  All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can be reasonably complied with, will be complied with. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting the requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. In no event may an applicant be given permission to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would be created. 
(5)  Once conformity with this chapter is achieved, the property shall not revert to its nonconforming status. 
(g)  Abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(1)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, whether or not any existing personal property or fixtures are removed, the property thereafter shall be used only for uses permitted in the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(2)  If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation (other than a nonconforming use) is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with a new zoning authorization or conditional use permit. The conditional use permit may allow the property to be used for a conforming purpose, without correcting the nonconforming situations, and may only be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible. The permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected in order for the use to occur. The permit-issuing authority shall find that the proposed use will not be in violation of subsection (d) of this section before the permit is issued. 
(3)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation or nonconforming use is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one (1) apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for twelve (12) months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(4)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the twelve-month period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this chapter. 
(h)  Existence of a nonconforming use. Whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the board of adjustment after public notice and hearing and in accordance with the rules of the board.

(3)  The commission shall make written findings of fact, and shall submit its findings together with its recommendations to the city council.

(e)  Public hearing and city council consideration. 
(1)  The city council shall not conduct a public hearing with regard to, nor act upon a proposed amendment to this chapter until it shall have received written findings of fact and a recommendation from the planning commission on the proposed amendment.

The zoning official shall determine the number of additional signs to be placed that may be necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter. The sign(s) shall bear there on the following: "PUBLIC HEARING" and "APPLICATION FOR ZONING CHANGE AND/OR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FILED WITH THE CITY OF WARRENSBURG CITY COUNCIL. PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE HELD ON (insert date and time) AT (insert location description and address), WARRENSBURG, MISSOURI." The zoning official may provide for such additional information to be placed on any such sign which would serve to fully inform the public as to the nature of such a zoning change or conditional use permit pending before the city council.

(4)  The city council may hold a public hearing on an application for change of zoning and an application for a conditional use permit at the same public hearing and for the same parcel of land. 
(5)  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure. If the city council does not take final action on a proposed amendment within one hundred twenty (120) days after the public hearing, the proposed amendment shall be deemed denied.

Other issues may be irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the mayor and excluded. 
(1)  In particular, when considering amendments to the zoning map: 
a.  The city council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the city council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification. 
b.  The city council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public. 
(2)  When considering a conditional use permit application, the city council shall consider the criteria outlined in section 27-300(c)(2) (a-g) for consideration by the planning and zoning commission.

Sec. 27-150. - PUD planned unit development overlay district. 
(a)  Statement of intent. The planned unit development (PUD) is designed to meet the needs of developments which are planned and developed as a unit. Such development may consist of individual lots or common building sites. It is the intent of this section to provide for planned communities having harmony of design and variety of function. PUDs are given density bonuses, and flexibility in the design of buildings, yards and circulation patterns in order to produce: 
(1)  A pattern of development which conserves the natural amenities and environmental assets of the land. Such a development must be environmentally and ecologically sound. It must take into account the limitations of the land under development and work within the framework of those limitations to prevent soil erosion, (by either wind or water), control stormwater run-off, and preserve trees. 
(2)  A creative and innovative approach to site planning which utilizes the land efficiently, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, and thereby lower development costs. 
(3)  A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of other sections of this chapter, and a wider range in the type of environment and structures available to the public. Areas must be well-designed, and may contain various building arrangements, such as clustered development, zero-lot-line, or attached structures. 
(4)  An environmentally sensitive design, which preserves existing natural or unique features, such as trees, watercourses, rock outcrops, and historical and similar irreplaceable assets. 
(5)  Open space and recreational amenities developed according to the needs of the residents and/or businesses, and the capacity of the land for such development. 
(6)  Lower overall development costs through more efficient use of the land. 
(b)  Designation of PUD; approval process. 
(1)  Planned unit development is an overlay district that modifies the regulations of the affected zoning district and requires a planned unit development conditional use permit.

4.  If the proposed planned unit development conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located; 
5.  If the location and size of the planned unit development conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to: 
(i)  The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls, and fences on the site; and 
(ii)  The nature and extent of proposed landscaping and buffering on the site. 
(iii)  If adequate utility, drainage, and other such necessary facilities have been or will be provided; and 
(iv)  If adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and alleys. 
b.  The planning and zoning commission shall arrive at a decision on the preliminary plan within sixty (60) days of the first meeting, except the planning and zoning with the consent of the developer may extend the sixty-day period. If the planning and zoning approves or approves with conditions, the application and the plan shall be sent to the city council. The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council in writing; or 
c.  If disapproved, the planning and zoning commission shall state in writing the reasons for its disapproval and refer specifically to those parts of the city plan or the intent of the city plan, the subdivision regulations, the major street plan, or chapter 27 of this Code, or other pertinent considerations including those specified in subsection 27-150(a) with which the development does not comply. After its decision, the planning and zoning commission shall forward its findings and recommendations in writing to the city council for final consideration; or 
d.  If the planning and zoning commission cannot reach a decision within the time period, the developer may proceed to subsection 27-150(b)(5).

a.  The city council shall not conduct a public hearing with regard to, nor act upon a planned unit development conditional use permit request until the planning and zoning commission shall have acted on the matter. 
b.  After the findings and recommendations of the planning and zoning commission have been filed with the city council or the requisite time period has passed, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the matter. The city council may not grant a planned unit development conditional use permit until a public hearing has been held on such ordinance. 
c.  Public notice. The zoning official shall cause public notice of the hearing to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Warrensburg. Publication shall commence not less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing date.

The sign(s) shall be posted at a point(s) nearest to the right-of-way of any street or roadway abutting such land, and so as to be clearly visible to the traveled portion of such street or roadway. The zoning official shall determine the number of additional signs to be placed that may be necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter. The sign(s) shall bear there on the following: "PUBLIC HEARING" and "APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FILED WITH THE CITY OF WARRENSBURG CITY COUNCIL. PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE HELD ON (insert date and time) AT (insert location description and address), WARRENSBURG, MISSOURI." The zoning official may provide for such additional information to be placed on any such sign which would serve to fully inform the public as to the nature of the conditional use permit pending before the city council. It is unlawful for any person to tamper with any sign required for public notice. 
d.  At the hearing, staff shall make a recommendation to the city council, the applicant shall be heard, and those both in favor of and opposed to the planned unit development conditional use permit will be given reasonable opportunity to be heard.

b.  Provide a performance bond or escrow account, set up according to terms of the city, in an amount sufficient to ensure satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the required improvements. If an escrow account is chosen by the developer, estimates of completed improvements may be presented to the city council together with a request for release of funds in the amount of completed improvements. Upon certification by the City of Warrensburg that such improvements have been completed to city standards and specifications, the city council may release that portion of funds in the escrow account. Before final withdrawal of funds from the escrow account, the developer shall certify to the city that all bills have been paid for materials and work on the required improvements.

(Ord. No. 2748, § 2, 6-22-92; Ord. No. 2928, § 3, 5-23-94; Ord. No. 3295, § 3, 1-12-98; Ord. No. 3296, §§ 1, 2, 1-12-98; Ord. No. 3514, § 1, 3-20-00; Ord. No. 3537, § 2, 6-12-00; Ord.

Sec. 27-201. - Permissible uses. 
(a)  Use of the designation Z, C, and AC in the table of permissible uses. When used in conjunction with section 27-200 (table of permissible uses) the following letter designations indicate the procedure required: 
"Z" means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the zoning official. 
"C" means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the city council. 
"AC" means an adult use conditional use permit must be obtained from the city council pursuant to section 27-119 of this Code. 
(b)  Permissible uses and specific exclusions. 
(1)  The presumption established by this chapter is that the uses of land permissible within the City of Warrensburg are listed in the table of permissible uses. Furthermore, land uses which are permissible within each zoning district have similar impacts. 
(2)  Uses of land that are not listed in the table of permissible uses are prohibited. Nor shall the table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one (1) zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts. 
(3)  Churches, synagogues, temples and similar places of worship (including associated residential structures for religious personnel and associated buildings) may be located in any zoning district. 
(4)  Municipal properties, including land, buildings, or premises owned, rented or leased by the City of Warrensburg are exempt from provisions of this ordinance while occupied or employed for public purposes in municipal rights, obligations, or pursuits, but such city property which is rented or leased to private persons must comply with all applicable provisions of this title [chapter]. 
(c)  Permissible uses not requiring permits. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no zoning or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses: 
(1)  Streets. 
(2)  Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way. 
(3)  Neighborhood utility facilities located within a preexisting public right-of-way. 
(d)  Change in use. 
(1)  A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on the property changes. This occurs whenever: 
a.  The change involves a change from one principal use category to another. 
b.  If there is only one (1) business or enterprise conducted on the lot, that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use category as the previous type of business). 
i.  For example, if there is only one (1) building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification 2.11. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed. 
ii.  If the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one (1) business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination use) has not changed. 
(2)  A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a substantial change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two (2) active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days or has been abandoned. 
(3)  A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use. 
(e)  The most specific use classification controls. Whenever a use could fall within more than one (1) use classification in the table of permissible uses, the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the use controls. For example, a small doctor's office or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130 "office or clinics of physicians or dentists with not more than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling. 
(Ord. No. 2748, § 2, 6-22-92; Ord. No. 3837, § 4, 10-14-03) 
Sec. 27-202. - Accessory uses. 
(a)  The table of permissible uses classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. A property, lot, or tract may have only one (1) principal use at a time. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (i) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on the property, or (ii) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a restaurant is customarily associated with and integrally related to a hotel or motel, and would be regarded as accessory to a hotel/motel use, and thus allowed with a zoning permit in the BO district. However, if developed apart from a hotel/motel development, public restaurant facilities would only be allowed in the BO business office district with a conditional use permit. In no event shall two (2) primary, unrelated uses occur upon any lot, tract or property in any zoning district. 
(b)  For purposes of interpreting subsection (a): 
(1)  A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is secondary to the principal, or primary, use; is subordinate to the primary use; or is insubstantial in and of itself. 
(2)  To be "commonly associated" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of the relationship of the two (2) uses. 
(c)  Examples of uses and activities regarded as accessory to principal uses are specified in the district regulations. 
(d)  Home occupations. Regulations governing home occupations in residential districts are presented in section 27-203. 
(Ord. No. 2748, § 2, 6-22-92; Ord. No. 4441, § 1, 3-9-09) 
Sec. 27-203. - Home occupations in residential districts. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. The conduct of certain businesses (home occupations, as defined in section 27-6) in residential neighborhoods may be permitted under the provisions of this section. It is the intent of this regulation to: 
(1)  Insure the compatibility of home occupations with the residential neighborhood in which they are located; 
(2)  Maintain and preserve the residential character of residential neighborhoods; and 
(3)  Guarantee to all residents freedom from excessive noise, excessive traffic, nuisance, fire hazard, and other possible effects of commercial uses being conducted in residential areas. 
(b)  Moratorium from enforcement. There shall be a moratorium from enforcement of the regulations pertaining to home occupations for a period of six (6) months from the effective date of this chapter, in order to permit residents to register, inform themselves, and conform to the new regulations. 
(c)  Registration of home occupations. 
(1)  Persons operating home occupations shall register their business with the zoning official. Failure to register a home occupation is a violation of this chapter. 
(2)  Registration of home occupations shall commence upon the effective date of this chapter. Home occupations shall be registered by means of a questionnaire. 
(d)  Prohibited home occupation. The following shall not be permitted as home occupations: 
(1)  Automobile mechanics. 
(2)  Funeral chapel or funeral home. 
(3)  Gift shop. 
(4)  Kennel or stable. 
(5)  Private schools with organized classes. 
(6)  Rental businesses. 
(7)  Restaurant. 
(8)  Veterinarian. 
(9)  Vehicle body work, including painting of vehicles, trailers or boats. 
(e)  Permitted home occupations. The following is a nonexhaustive list of examples of enterprises that may be home occupations if they meet the performance standards in paragraph (h), below: 
(1)  Administrative or professional office. 
(2)  Artists, musicians, authors. 
(3)  Catering. 
(4)  Day care home where care is given by a person licensed by the State of Missouri as a family day care home provider for no more than ten (10) persons not related to the caregiver. State regulations regarding overlap care and care of additional school-age children due to emergency school closings shall apply to day care homes located in the City of Warrensburg. 
(5)  Dressmaking, sewing, tailoring. 
(6)  Home crafts. 
(7)  Mail order. 
(8)  Typing, stenographic or word processing services. 
(9)  The keeping of up to three (3) roomers or boarders. 
(f)  Permits required for certain home occupations. Certain home occupations have the potential to create a negative impact on residential areas due to client traffic, parking, noise, storage requirements, and the use and disposal of chemical agents. The planning and zoning commission finds that if regulated, these home occupations can be good neighbors. In addition to registration, the following home occupations shall be required to obtain a permit in order to operate in residential districts: 
(1)  Catering. 
(2)  Antiques, second hand shop. 
(3)  Beauty, barber shops. 
(4)  Cabinet building, carpentry shops. 
(5)  Offices of medical or health professionals. 
(6)  Photo studios. 
(7)  Repair services. 
(8)  Cleaning services. 
(g)  Permit requirements. 
(1)  Persons desiring to operate home occupations which require permits shall complete an application.

Sec. 27-401. - Reserved. 
Sec. 27-402. - Parking facilities provided by others; joint use of parking facilities. 
(a)  Not more than fifty (50) percent of the off-street parking facilities required for theaters, churches, bowling alleys, dance halls and establishments for the sale of food or refreshments, may be supplied by off-street parking facilities provided for other kinds of buildings or uses not normally open, used or operated during the principal operating hours of these uses.

(Ord. No. 2748, § 2, 6-22-92) 
Sec. 27-404. - Rules for computing parking spaces. 
(a)  All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of off-street parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question. Except as provided herein, developments shall comply with the minimum number of parking spaces as set forth in section 27-406, Table of parking requirements. 
(b)  How parking requirements are applied. 
(1)  The parking requirements of land use classification 1.000 to 1.900 (residential uses) shall apply to every use district, except as further set out below. 
Exception: In the central business district where no setback building line is required, and where an existing space is being converted to three (3) or fewer dwelling units in an existing commercial building in the basement or on the second or higher floor, there shall be no off-street parking required. 
(2)  The parking requirements of land use classifications 2.000 to 25.000 shall apply in full to buildings, structures and uses within such use district, with the exception that, in the central business district where no setback building line is required, there shall be no off-street parking required. 
(c)  The planning commission and city council recognize that the table of parking requirements set forth in section 27-406 cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit-issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide. 
(d)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it received in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by the table of parking standards (section 27-406) for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 27-29, Amendments and rezonings. 
(e)  Uses in the table of parking requirements (section 27-406) are indicated by a numerical reference keyed to the table of permissible uses, section 27-200. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one (1) parking space. 
(f)  Where buildings contain mixed occupancies, the parking and loading requirements shall be provided for each occupancy in accordance with the percentage of area in the building occupied by such occupancy. 
(g)  Each garage or carport and driveway combination shall be counted as off-street parking spaces per the following: 
(1)  A one-lane driveway shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width. A multi-lane driveway shall require ten (10) feet in width for each lane of the driveway. 
(2)  Each twenty-three (23) linear feet of a lane of a driveway between a garage or carport and the property line may count as one parking space, up to a maximum of two (2) spaces per lane. 
(3)  Each garage or carport bay shall count as one additional parking space. 
(4)  Each driveway shall be allowed one (1) wing-out parking space per the minimum length and width requirements as stated above. A second wing-out parking space shall be allowed when the single-lane approach is in excess of fifty (50) linear feet. Each driveway that terminates in a garage or carport is allowed, in addition to the lanes terminating in a garage or carport, a maximum of one (1) lane width or wing-out which does not terminate in a garage or carport bay. 

(5)  When the single-lane approach of a driveway is in excess of fifty (50) feet, a turnaround pad is allowed along the driveway. The pad shall be no more than 60 square feet in size and shall begin a minimum of 40 feet from the property line adjacent to the street. The turnaround pad is allowed in addition to the wing-out(s) allowed in subsection (4) above.
