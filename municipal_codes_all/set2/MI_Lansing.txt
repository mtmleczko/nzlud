FOREWARD 
    Most communities, when recodifying their ordinances simply hand over the old Code and several boxes of paper to a codifier and wait for the end result. While less burdensome, this method can leave people with less knowledge than they had before about the laws that govern the city. 
    Lansing did it the hard way. Every chapter of the "old" Code was reviewed, and many were simply thrown out. Each department provided input into the ordinances with which they worked every day. Chapter revisions were introduced as individual ordinances, and the Council conducted at least one public hearing on each. The Mayor and Council discussed all of the ordinances that were rewritten and adopted. The result was a molding of a single document that was tailored to the expressed needs and desires of the people of Lansing. 
    It has been twenty-nine years since the Code was last rewritten. Obviously in that time laws became antiquated, out-moded, cumbersome and unenforceable. Like snowflakes, no two communities' Code books are alike. 
    Doing it the hard way, however, has taken more than two years of solid work. Each chapter, each page, and virtually each word has been reviewed and rewritten. For this immense amount of work some extraordinary people put in tremendous hours and deserve special thanks. These were the people who worked on every ordinance and kept the project organized and moving. 
RON ONUFER - Who coordinated the project and kept the paperwork flowing. 
HERB DAVIDSON - Who went over each of the drafts to make sure we had everything included. 
KAREN TURY - Who kept the minutes of the General Services Committee meetings, sometimes six pages of amendments in one meeting. 
MARY PIERCE and EMILY SALMONS - Who entered the 1250 page Code into the computer and typed redraft after redraft. 
AL KNOT - City Attorney who did the drafting and research of the documents for the Council's view. 
VICKIE BELL - Who represented the City Clerk's office and researched license and permit procedures. 
    This is not an all inclusive list and the others who put in the hours to make this possible are listed separately. 
    My special thanks to the Councilmembers who served on the General Services Committee during the past two years: Alfreda Schmidt, Charles Creamer, Patrick Lindemann, Lou Adado, and James Blair. They all contributed a great deal during some very long meetings. 
    Finally my thanks to Mayor Terry McKane who made this project a priority and gave unhesitatingly of City staff's time to make this document possible. 
    The laws of a community reflect that community's priorities and commitments. As the priorities change so too must the law. Failing to do so can leave a community frustrated and unable to respond effectively to the needs of the citizenry. This recodification is not an end, but only a continuing step, and we are proud to present it to the People of the City of Lansing.

    EDITOR'S NOTE: The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01. 
    With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are, for the most part, initially even-numbered, thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043 follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to be placed in their logical position. 
    Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time, or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without histories or with the word "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these Codified Ordinances. 
    The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

.1  Any person owning property specially assessed shall have sixty (60) days from the mailing of a notice of confirmation of the special assessment roll to notify the City Clerk in writing of any claimed illegality in the special assessment process.

.2  If the City Attorney submits a written opinion finding the special assessment roll illegal, in whole or in part, the City Council may revoke its confirmation, correct the illegality, if possible, and reconfirm it.

.1  Upon the confirmation of each special assessment roll, the special assessments thereon shall become a debt to the City from the persons to whom they are assessed and until paid shall be a lien upon the property assessed, for the amount of such assessments and all interest and charges thereon.

.2  The Council may provide by ordinance for fees, penalties, and interest for the late payment or nonpayment of special assessments, which fees, penalties, and interest shall be a lien and shall be collectable as are similar charges upon City taxes. The Council may provide that delinquent special assessments be placed upon the tax roll, together with any accrued fees, penalties and interest thereon, to be collected in all respects as are City taxes on such roll, or may make other provisions for the lien created by such special assessments. 
7-406 - Postponement of payments. 
    The Council may provide that persons who, in the opinion of the Assessor and Council, by reason of poverty, are unable to contribute toward the cost of the making of a public improvement, may execute to the City an instrument creating a lien for the benefit of the City on all or any part of the real property owned by them and benefited by any public improvement, which lien will mature and be effective from and after the execution of such instrument and shall be enforceable in the event that title to such property is thereafter transferred in any manner whatsoever.

7-408 - All property liable for special assessment. 
    All real property, including such as is exempt from taxation by law or exempted by the Board of Review, and with or without valuation placed thereon, shall be liable for the cost of public improvements benefiting such property, unless exempted therefrom by law, the same as other property, as provided in Section 7-402, and such special assessments shall be levied, collected, and returned, and the said premises may be sold or forfeited in the same manner as for nonpayment of City taxes.

C.  Sealed bids shall also be solicited from all persons who are on the most current bidder's list by mailing them a copy of such newspaper notice or another notice that will acquaint them with the proposed purchase or sale. Invitations for bids sent to prospective bidders on the bidder's list shall be limited to commodities that are similar in character and ordinarily handled by the trade group to which the bid invitations are sent. Failure to respond to three consecutive bid invitations shall result in removal from the bidder's list for one year. After one year, the potential bidder may reapply to be placed upon the bidder's list. 
D.

(5)  If compensation, contract requirements and contract documents can be agreed upon with the most qualified offeror, the using agency and the Director shall recommend to the Mayor that the contract be awarded by the Mayor to such person. If the Director and the using agency are unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the person considered to be most qualified, then negotiations with such person shall be formally terminated.

The list of qualified persons shall remain on file in the Finance Department, and if the person being requested to submit a bid fails to submit a response to three consecutive projects, the person shall be removed from the list of qualified persons.

(Ord. No. 539, 6-12-79) 
208.02. - Acquisition policy. 
    In order to encourage and expedite the acquisition of real property by agreements with owners, to avoid litigation and relieve congestion in the courts, to assure consistent treatment for owners in many City programs, and to promote public confidence in City land acquisition practices, the Mayor and heads of City departments, divisions and agencies shall, to the greatest extent practical, be guided by the following policies: 
(a)  The Mayor or designated head of a City department, division or agency shall make every reasonable effort to acquire real property expeditiously by negotiation. 
(b)  Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations to purchase. The owner or his or her designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his or her inspection of the property. 
(c)  Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, the Mayor or designated head of a City department, division or agency concerned shall establish an amount which he or she believes to be just compensation therefor and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the department's, division's or agency's approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, except as is provided in Section 208.06. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement, use or purpose for which such property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, use or purpose, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The Mayor or designated head of a City department, division or agency concerned shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. 
(d)  No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the City pays the agreed purchase price in the prescribed manner, or deposits with the court for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property. 
(e)  The construction or development of a public improvement, purpose or use shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practical, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling or to move a business or other operation without written notice from the City at least 90 days before the date by which such move is required. 
(f)  If the City permits an owner or tenant to occupy real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupant. 
(g)  In no event shall the City either advance the time of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner, or take any other action coercive in nature in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property. 
(h)  If any interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, the City shall institute formal condemnation proceedings, through the Department of Law and with the approval of Council. Neither the Mayor nor a designated City department, division or agency head shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his or her real property. 
(i)  If the acquisition of only part of a property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, the City shall offer to acquire the entire property. 
(Ord. No. 539, 6-12-79) 
208.03. - Acquisition of buildings, structures and improvements. 
(a)  Acquisition of Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the City acquires on its behalf any interest in real property, it will acquire at least an equal interest in all buildings, structures or other improvements located upon the real property so acquired, and which it requires to be removed from such real property, or which it determines will be adversely affected by the use to which such real property will be put. 
(b)  Compensation. 
(1)  For the purpose of determining the just compensation to be paid for any building, structure or other improvement acquired pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, such building, structure or other improvement shall be deemed to be a part of the real property to be acquired, notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant, as against the owner of any other interest in real property, to remove such building, structure or improvement at the expiration of his or her term, and the fair market value which such building, structure or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the real property to be acquired, or the fair market value of removing such building, structure or improvement from the real property, whichever is the greater, shall be paid to the tenant therefor. 
(2)  Payment under this section shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by law. No such payment shall be made, unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer and release to the City all his or her right, title and interest in and to such improvements. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to deprive the tenant of any rights to reject payment under this section and to obtain payment for such property interests in accordance with applicable law, other than this section. 
(Ord. No. 539, 6-12-79) 
208.04. - Reimbursement of expenses incident to transfer of title. 
    The Mayor or designated head of a City department, division or agency, as soon as practical after the date of payment of the purchase price or the date of deposit in court of funds to satisfy the award of compensation in a condemnation proceeding to acquire real property, whichever is earlier, shall reimburse the owner, to whatever extent is fair and reasonable, for expenses he or she incurred necessarily for:

(Ord. No. 539, 6-12-79) 
208.06. - Exchanges, donations, gifts and dealings with publicly held properties. 
(a)  In cases where real property is acquired in exchange, or with no or a reduced monetary consideration for other real property owned by the City, the Mayor or designated head of any City department, division or agency concerned shall obtain an appraisal of the property to be acquired and an appraisal of the property to be disposed of. The monetary consideration to be paid by either the owner of real property or the City shall be the difference between the appraisals, unless the owner of real property elects, after being provided a full and complete written statement as to the value differential, to release the City from making a payment of such value differential. In cases where the real property being disposed of by the City is greater in value than the real property it is acquiring, the owner of the real property to be acquired shall remit to the City the value differential. All exchanges shall also be subject to other requirements relating to the disposal of City-owned real property found in Sections 208.08 through 208.10. 
(b)  In cases where owners of real property desire to donate or give real property to the City for private philanthropic reasons or tax considerations, the Mayor or designated head of any City department, division or agency concerned shall request the City Assessor to establish a value for such donated real property, and shall provide a written report estimating closing and incidental expenses, anticipated development costs, if any, and anticipated annual maintenance costs. Such information will be submitted to the Mayor for his or her review and recommendation to Council as to the acceptance or rejection of the real property proposed to be donated to the City. Council shall determine whether or not to accept the proposed donation, by resolution. A failure to act shall be deemed rejection of the offer. 
(c)  In cases where real property is to be acquired from public entities, the Mayor or designated City department, division or agency shall obtain an appraisal of the real property, to establish its fair market value. Acquisition, in such cases, may be accomplished at a purchase price less than the established fair market value, provided that mutual agreement is reached by the public entity and the City department, division or agency concerned. Real property under the jurisdictional control of the Board of Water and Light, which is no longer required for purposes of its operation, may be transferred to another City department, division or agency upon written consent of the Board and acceptance by the Mayor. In such event, if the real property was purchased by the Board, then the actual purchase price, plus costs incident to transfer of the title, shall be the compensation paid to the Board, unless otherwise agreed. The Mayor shall initiate a resolution for Council's approval, transferring jurisdiction to the user department, division or agency. If such real property is not necessary for City use by any City department, division or agency, it may be returned to the tax rolls under a method prescribed by the Mayor. 
(d)  In cases where real property is to be acquired from entities exempt from the City's use of the power of eminent domain, the Mayor or designated head of any City department, division or agency concerned shall obtain an appraisal to establish the fair market value of the real property to be acquired. The fair market value so established shall be utilized as the basis of negotiation with the noncondemnable entity. After negotiations, and upon reaching a purchase price that is tentatively acceptable to the noncondemnable entity and the City, the head of the City department, division or agency concerned shall obtain approval from the Mayor and Council of such purchase price prior to the issuance of a formal offer to purchase such real property. 
(Ord. No. 539, 6-12-79)

The area of land shall be a strip of land, on both banks of the water body, bounded by the normal water's edge and a line 25 feet, horizontal measure, from and paralleling such edge. The area of water shall be the width of the river or creek itself, i.e., the area across the body of water from normal water's edge to normal water's edge. The normal water's edge shall be determined from the most recent topographic maps of the City that are on file in the Department of Planning and Municipal Development and in the Public Service Department. 
(b)  The Mayor shall cause to be prepared a written inventory of all real property provided for in subsection (a) hereof. Such inventory shall be prepared and filed with the City Clerk and Council within one year of the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 539, passed June 12, 1979).

A.  To cover a general fund deficit, should the City's annual audit reveal such a deficit; 
B.  To prevent a reduction in the level of public services or in the number of employees at any time in the fiscal year when the City's budgeted revenue is not being collected in an amount sufficient to cover budgeted expenses;

    The City of Lansing, through its City Council, finds that there exists and will continue to exist a need among its citizens to have assistance in meeting everyday challenges. In the interest of the "public health," in its broadest sense, the City is committed to providing a locally funded revenue base which supports the needs of citizens by funding basic human services. In addition, it is recognized that the City's commitment in establishing a revenue base for basic human services provides an avenue through which federal, state and/or private resources can be accessed to enhance the funding of local service providers.

(b)  These funds will be used to provide a locally funded revenue base that supports basic human services. These funds may be used for the direct provision of basic human services by local community-based, non-profit, charitable organizations and/or they may be used as match or leverage by these agencies to secure additional funds from federal, state and/or private sources to support human service delivery initiatives.

In determining the member's final average compensation, the member's compensations paid by the County Health Department shall be treated as if they were paid by the City. The retirement allowance shall begin the first day of the calendar month next following the month in which the member's application for the same is filed with the Board on or after the member's attainment of the age of 60 years, or the member's retirement from County employment, whichever is later. If the member withdraws all or part of his or her accumulated contributions from the employees' savings fund, he or she shall thereupon cease to be a member and shall forfeit all rights in and to a deferred retirement allowance as provided for in this section. 
(e)  For a member separating from City service pursuant to the early retirement incentives, approved by the Council on April 18, 1988, the commencement age of 58 years provided in Subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall be replaced by a commencement age that is the earlier of the age of 58 years, or the age in years and full months which, when added to the member's years and full months of credited service, equals or exceeds 65 years.

(a)  Upon the application of a member, or the member's department head, the Chief District Judge or the Housing Commission Director on the member's behalf, a member who is in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, has ten or more years of credited service and becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission by reason of a personal injury or disease, may be retired by the Board of Trustees, provided that: 
(1)  After a medical examination of the member made by or under the direction of the Medical Director, the Medical Director certifies to the Board that the member is mentally or physically totally incapacitated for duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission and that such incapacity will probably be permanent; and 
(2)  The report of the Medical Director is concurred in by the Board. 
(b)  The ten-year service requirement provided for in Subsection (a) hereof shall be waived for a member if: 
(1)  The Board finds that the member is totally and permanently incapacitated for duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury or disease arising out of and in the course of the actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission; and 
(2)  The member is in receipt of workers' compensation on account of his or her total and permanent incapacity occurring as the result of employment with the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission.

292.24. - Computation of benefits for nonduty disability. 
    If a member retires on account of total and permanent disability, as provided in Section 292.23, and the Board of Trustees finds that such member's disability did not occur as the result of causes arising out of and in the course of the member's actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance computed according to Section 292.21, exclusive of Subsection (b) thereof. In no case shall the member's disability retirement allowance be less than 14 percent of his or her final average compensation. The member's disability retirement allowance shall be subject to Sections 292.32, 292.33 and 292.34. Upon the member's retirement, he or she shall have the right to elect to receive a retirement allowance under an option provided in Section 292.27 in lieu of a straight life retirement allowance. 
(Ord. No. 707, 9-30-85) 
292.25. - Computation of benefits for duty disability. 
    If a member retires before attainment of the age of 60 years on account of total and permanent disability, as provided in Section 292.23, and the Board of Trustees finds that the member's disability is the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of the member's actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, the member shall receive a disability retirement allowance computed according to Section 292.21, exclusive of Subsection (b) thereof. In computing the member's disability retirement allowance, the credited service to be used shall be the sum of the member's credited service in force at the date of retirement and the number of years, and fraction of a year in the period from the date of the member's retirement to the date the member would attain the age of 60 years. During the workers' compensation period, the member's disability retirement allowance shall not exceed the difference between the member's final compensation and workers' compensation converted to an annual basis. The member's disability retirement allowance shall be subject to Sections 292.32, 292.33 and 292.34. Upon retirement, the member shall have the right to elect to receive a retirement allowance under an option provided in Section 292.27 in lieu of a straight life retirement allowance. Upon the attainment of the age of 60 years, the retirant shall be removed from disability retirement and transferred to age and service retirement, as provided in Section 292.21. 
(Ord. No. 707, 9-30-85) 
292.26. - Increase in benefits. 
(a)  The benefits calculated in Sections 292.21, 292.24 and 292.25 shall be increased as per this subsection. Effective February 1, 1984, benefits for retirant and beneficiaries whose effective date of retirement is before November 4, 1979, shall receive an increase. Such increase shall be calculated by this formula: One percent of the retirant's or beneficiary's benefit on February 1, 1984, times the number of full calendar years between the effective date of retirement and January 1, 1984. 
(b)  Except as provided in Subsection 292.26(c), the benefits calculated in Sections 292.21, 292.24 and 292.25 shall be increased as per this subsection. Effective February 1, 1987, benefits for retirants and beneficiaries whose effective date of retirement is before November 4, 1982, shall receive an increase. This increase shall be calculated by this formula: three percent times the retirant's or beneficiary's benefit on February 1, 1987. 
    Effective January 1, 1998 each retirant and beneficiary whose effective date of retirement is before January 1, 1998 and whose retirement allowance is smaller than the minimum retirement allowance provided in this subsection, shall have his or her retirement allowance increased to the minimum retirement allowance. A person affected by Section 292.20(f) shall not be eligible for the minimum retirement allowance. A person whose retirement allowance is based on fewer than eight years of credited service, other than persons receiving retirement allowances under Section 292.25 or Section 292.28, shall not be eligible for the minimum retirement allowance. The minimum annual retirement allowance is the product of the point value, described in this subsection, times the sum of: 
    The number of full years between the retirant's or beneficiary's effective date of retirement and January 1, 1998, plus one and one-half times the number of full years of credited service upon which the retirant's or beneficiary's retirement allowance is based. For a person receiving a retirement allowance provided in Section 292.25 or Section 292.28 a minimum of 20 years of credited service shall be used for purposes of this paragraph. 
The point value is one of the following: 
For a retirant who elected Option A provided in Section 292.27, or a beneficiary of such a retirant, the point value is $100.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option A retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For a retirant who elected Option B provided in Section 292.27, the point value is $100.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option B retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For the beneficiary of a retirant who elected Option B provided in Section 292.27, the point value is $50.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option B retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For all other retirant's and beneficiaries the point value is $100.00. The cost of this minimum retirement allowance provision shall be borne by the December 31, 1997 contingency reserve in the retirement reserve fund. Effective January 1, 1999 and each January 1 thereafter, the retirement allowance will be increased for each retirant and beneficiary who meets both of the following conditions: 
The retirant's or beneficiary's effective date of retirement is at least six months prior to the January 1 increase date, and 
The retirant has attained the age of 60 years as of the January 1 increase date, or, in the case of a beneficiary the deceased retirant or deceased member would have attained the age of 60 years as of the January 1 increase date. 
The retirement allowance increases are cumulative but not compounded. A person affected by Section 292.20(f) shall have his or her cumulative retirement allowance increase under this subsection reduced by the retirement allowance increase attributable to the 2.75 percent benefit formula and the five additional years of credited service provided in Section 292.20(f). A person affected by any early retirement window incentive benefit provision other than the provision in Section 292.20(f) shall have his or her cumulative retirement allowance increase under this subsection reduced by the retirement allowance increase attributable to the early retirement window incentive provision. A person whose retirement allowance is based on fewer than eight years of credited service, other than persons receiving retirement allowances under Section 292.25 or Section 292.28, shall not be eligible for the retirement allowance increases under this subsection. The amount of the annual increase in retirement allowance shall be three percent of the annual retirement allowance that would be payable in the absence of this subsection. However, the maximum annual increase will be one of the following: 
For a retirant who elected Option A provided in Section 292.27, or a beneficiary of such a retirant, the maximum annual retirement allowance increase is $200.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option A retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For a retirant who elected Option B provided in Section 292.27, the maximum annual retirement allowance increase is $200.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option B retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For the beneficiary of a retirant who elected Option B provided in Section 292.27, the maximum annual retirement allowance increase is $100.00 times the ratio of the retirant's original Option B retirement allowance divided by the retirant's original straight life retirement allowance; or 
For all other retirants and beneficiaries the maximum annual retirement allowance increase is $200.00. 
In no event shall the cumulative retirement allowance increase provided in this subsection exceed, on a percentage basis, the cumulative increase in the consumers price index from the effective date of retirement to the January 1 increase date. The cost of the benefits provided in this subsection shall be borne by a portion of the investment income credited to the members benefit fund. Three-eighths of the first eight percent investment income that is credited to the members' benefit fund is earmarked for this purpose. 
The actuary shall report annually on the sufficiency of the members' benefit fund, based on that report. 
The Board of Trustees may from time to time increase, but not decrease. The maximum annual retirement allowance increase amount in this subsection. 
(c)  Section 292.26(b) shall not apply to a retirant who becomes a member pursuant to Section 292.14(d), Section 292.14(e), or Section 292.14(f).

292.27. - Retirement allowance options. 
    Any member may, prior to the effective date of his or her retirement, but not thereafter, elect to receive his or her retirement allowance as a straight life retirement allowance payable throughout his or her life and terminating at death, or he or she may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her straight life retirement allowance, at that time, in a reduced retirement allowance payable throughout his or her life, and nominate a beneficiary, in accordance with Option 1, A or B as follows:

If a retirant, who elected Option 1, dies before he or she has received in payment of the annuity portions of his or her reduced retirement allowance an aggregate amount equal to, but not exceeding, accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund at the time of retirement, then the difference between his or her accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of annuity payments received by him or her shall be paid to such person or persons as he or she nominates by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board of Trustees. If there is no such designated person surviving the retirant, then such difference, if any, shall be paid to his or her estate. 
Joint and Survivor Allowance - Option A. Upon the death of a retirant who elected Option A, his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person, having an insurable interest in his or her life, as he or she had nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board prior to the effective date of his or her retirement. 
Modified Joint and Survivor Allowance - Option B. Upon the death of a retirant who elected Option B, one-half of his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person, having an insurable interest in his or her life, as he or she had nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board prior to the effective date of his or her retirement.

292.28. - Benefits for death incurred in line of duty. 
(a)  Conditions for Benefits. If a member dies as the result of a personal injury or disease arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of employment by the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, or if a disability retirant dies prior to attaining the age of 60 years and within a period of three years from and after the disability retirement as the result of the same injury or disease for which the member retired, and in either case the death, injury or disease resulting in death is found by the Board of Trustees to have occurred as the natural and proximate result of causes arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of the actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, then the applicable benefits provided in Subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) hereof shall be paid, subject to the condition that workers' compensation is paid on account of the death of the member or retirant. 
(b)  Accumulated Contributions. In the case of a deceased member, the accumulated contributions standing to such member's credit in the employees' savings fund at the time of death shall be paid in accordance with Section 292.31.

Such pension shall begin upon termination of the surviving spouse's workers' compensation period and shall terminate upon death. As used in this section, "surviving spouse" means the person to whom the deceased member or retirant was married at the time such member's employment with the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission last terminated. 
(d)  Children's Benefits. Unmarried children under the age of 21 years shall each receive a child's pension equal to the child's weekly workers' compensation converted to an annual basis.

If the surviving spouse's pension is terminated, as provided in Subsection (c) hereof, and if an unmarried child or children, under the age of 21 years, of the deceased member or retirant, outlive the surviving spouse, each such child's pension shall be increased by an equal share of the surviving spouse's pension.

    Any member who continues in the employ of the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission on or after the date such member acquires eight years of credited service may, at any time prior to the member's retirement, elect Option A as provided for in Section 292.27, in the same manner as if the member were then retiring from employment with the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission, and nominate a beneficiary whom the Board of Trustees finds to be dependent upon the member for at least 50 percent of the beneficiary's support due to lack of financial means. Prior to the effective date of retirement, a member may revoke the election of Option A and nomination of beneficiary, and may again elect Option A and nominate a beneficiary, as provided in this section. Upon the death or marriage or remarriage of such beneficiary prior to the effective date of the member's retirement, the election of Option A and nomination of beneficiary shall be automatically revoked. Upon the death of a member who has an Option A election in force, the member's beneficiary shall immediately receive a retirement allowance computed according to Section 292.21, exclusive of Subsection (b) thereof, in the same manner in all respects as if the member had retired under an Option A election the day preceding the date of the member's death, notwithstanding that the member might not have attained the age of 58 years.

If any such disability retirant refuses to submit to such medical examination in any such period, the retirant's disability retirement allowance may be discontinued by the Board until the retirant withdraws such refusal. If such refusal continues for one year, all the retirant's rights in and to a disability retirement allowance may be revoked by the Board. If, upon such medical examination of a retirant, the Medical Director reports to the Board, and such report is concurred in by the Board, that the retirant is physically able and capable of resuming employment with the City, the retirant shall be re-employed by the City, the District Court or the Housing Commission and the disability retirement allowance shall terminate.

(a)  If a disability retirant becomes engaged in a gainful occupation, business or employment, and the sum of pay or other remuneration from such occupation, business or employment and the retirant's disability retirement allowance exceeds the retirant's final compensation, then the amount of the retirant's disability retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount which, together with the amount so earned by the disability retirant, shall equal, but not exceed, the final compensation. For the purpose of this section only, a retirant's final compensation shall be increased two percent for each completed calendar year such retirant is in receipt of a disability retirement allowance. If the retirant's earnings are later changed, the disability retirement allowance shall be adjusted accordingly. 
(b)  Each disability retirant shall file with the Board of Trustees, at least annually, on forms furnished by the Board, a statement of his or her earnings, together with such supporting data as may be requested by the Board to establish a basis for determining earnings for operation of this section.

Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein.

292.36. - Retirement reserve fund. 
    There is hereby established a retirement reserve fund. From it shall be paid all annuities and pensions payable, as provided in this chapter. If a disability reliant [retirant] returns to the employ of the City, the District court or the Housing Commission, the disability reliant's [retirant's] annuity reserve computed as of the date of his or her return shall be transferred from the retirement reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and shall be credited to the member's individual account therein and the member's pension reserve at the time shall be transferred to the pension accumulation fund. Effective December 31, 1997, an amount shall be transferred from the retirement reserve fund to the members benefit fund so that after the transfer the December 31, 1997, balance in the retirement reserve fund is equal to the actuarial present value of retirement allowances to be paid after December 31, 1997, to all retardants [retirants] and beneficiaries in receipt of retirement allowances at December 31, 1997, including the actuarial present value of benefits provided in Subsection 292.26(c), but excluding the actuarial present value of benefits provided in Subsection 292.26(d). Effective December 31, 1998, and each December 31 thereafter, after receipt of the annual actuarial valuation, the balance in the retirement reserve fund shall be brought into balance with the actuarial present value of retirement allowances to be paid after December 31 to all retardants [retirants] and beneficiaries in receipt of retirement allowances at December 31, excluding the actuarial present value of all benefits provided in Subsection 292.26(d). Effective that same December 31, after the transfer provided in the previous sentence, an amount shall be transferred from the members benefit fund to the retirement reserve fund, such amount being equal to the estimated amount of benefits to be paid during the following calendar year pursuant to Subsection 292.26(d).

Upon the basis of such mortality and other tables of experience, and regular interest, as the Board of Trustees from time to time adopts, the actuary shall annually compute the annuity and pension reserves for annuities and pensions being paid retardants [retirants] and beneficiaries, and covering service rendered and to be rendered by members. The portion of the annuity and pension reserves not financed by members' contributions shall be financed by annual appropriations, to be made by council, determined according to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereof. 
(1)  The appropriations for members current service shall be a percentage of their annual compensations that will produce an amount which, if paid annually by the City during their future service, will be sufficient to provide the reserves, at the time of the members retirements, for the pension portions of the retirement allowances to be paid them based upon their future service. 
(2)  The appropriations for members accrued service shall be a percentage of their annual compensations that will produce an amount to be determined by the board which, if paid annually by the City over a period of years, will amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded annuity and pension reserves, if any, for the accrued service portions of the retirement allowances to which the members might be entitled. 
(3)  The appropriations for pensions and retirement allowances being paid retardants [retirants] and beneficiaries shall be a percentage of the annual compensation of members that will produce an amount, to be determined by the Board, which, if paid annually by the City over a period of years, will amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded annuity and pension reserves, if any, for pensions and retirement allowances being paid retardants [retirants] and beneficiaries. 
(Ord. No. 707, 9-30-85; Ord. No. 995,  1, 9-8-98) 
292.37A. - Members benefit fund. 
    The members benefit fund is hereby created as of December 31, 1997, for the purpose of funding the benefits provided in Subsection 292.26(d) and funding the post-retirement health insurance benefits provided in Section 292.37B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 292.43, the members benefit fund shall be credited investment income at a rate consistent with the method used to determine the actuarial value of assets in the annual actuarial report. Effective December 31, 1998, and each December 31 thereafter, an amount shall be transferred from the members' benefit fund to the retirement reserve fund, as specified in Section 292.36, for purposes of funding the benefits provided in Subsection 292.26(d). Each July 1, beginning July 1, 1999, an amount equal to three-eighths of the first eight percent investment income that is credited to the members' benefit fund the previous calendar year shall be transferred from the members benefit fund to the health insurance fund, for purposes of funding the retiree health insurance benefits provided in Section 292.37B. 
(Ord. No. 995,  1, 9-8-98) 
292.37B. - Health insurance fund. 
    The health insurance fund is hereby created as of January 1, 1998, and shall be the fund for receiving contributions for post-retirement health insurance benefits. The initial balance as of January 1, 1998, shall be $x,xxx,xxx.xx, which amount is equal to the December 31, 1997, asset receivable allocated to health insurance advance funding from the City's general fund. City contributions, as specified in this section, for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, shall be credited to the health insurance fund. Transfers from the members benefit fund, as specified in Section 292.37A, shall be credited to the health insurance fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 292.43, the health insurance fund shall be credited investment income at a rate consistent with the method used to determine the actuarial value of assets in the annual actuarial report. Premiums or charges, as specified in this section, for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, shall be paid from the health insurance fund. 
(1)  Beginning July 1, 1998, the City's annual contribution to the health insurance fund equal the sum of the actuarially computed normal cost for the year plus an amortization of the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses arising from the experience of active members on or after January 1, 1998, using an amortization period adopted by the Board of Trustees for this purpose. However, in no case shall the City's annual contribution to the health insurance fund exceed the limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(h) and the regulations thereunder. The amount, if any, by which the contribution must be reduced, in order to comply with the limitation imposed by Section 401(h), shall instead be contributed to a voluntary employees' beneficiary association established by the City for this purpose. 
(2)  Beginning July 1, 1998, and each year thereafter, a portion of the premiums or charges for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, may be paid from the health insurance fund on behalf of eligible retirees and beneficiaries of the retirement system in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreements and personnel rules of the City. Except for retirees who become eligible pursuant to Section 292.14(d), Section 292.14(e), or Section 292.14(f) the portion of the premiums or charges that will be paid from the health insurance fund is a percentage of such premiums or charges paid on behalf of persons with retirement effective dates on or after January 1, 1998. The percentage shall be four percent in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998, increasing four percent each year thereafter until it reaches 100 percent for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2022. The amount of premiums or charges paid from the health insurance fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, paid from a voluntary employees beneficiary association established by the City for this purpose. Notwithstanding the method specified in this subsection to compute the portion of the premiums or charges that are paid from the health insurance fund, the fund balance of the health insurance fund at any point in time is reserved to support the post retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and medicare reimbursement benefits, of all eligible retirees and beneficiaries of the retirement system regardless of retirement effective date. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the creation or maintenance within the retirement system of the health insurance fund, this section is not to be construed or deemed to have established or removed any benefits, financial or otherwise, subject to Article IX, Section 24 of the 1963 Constitution of the State of Michigan. Nor shall the creation and maintenance of the health insurance fund preclude the City from giving consideration to and implementing cost containment measures as provided by law. Instead, the purpose of this section is to put in place a mechanism for the advance funding of post-retirement health insurance benefits for eligible retirees, and not, apart from the advance funding obligation, to grant additional rights or to take away any rights which eligible retirees may already have.

The crediting of moneys to the various funds of the system shall be interpreted to refer to accounting procedures and not to the actual segregation of moneys in the various funds of the system. 
    The funds shall be held and administered for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the members and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of the retirement system. The entire amount of all moneys paid into the fund shall constitute an irrevocable contribution by the City, and the City shall have no further rights or claims to said funds other than such amounts as remain in the funds upon the retirement system's termination because of erroneous actuarial computations after the satisfaction of all fixed and contingent obligations to the members and their beneficiaries. A balance due to an erroneous actuarial computation shall mean any surplus arising because actual requirement differed from expected requirements based on previous actuarial valuations of liabilities or determination of costs of providing pension benefits under the retirement system in accordance with reasonable assumptions as to mortality, interest, and the like, and correct procedures relating to the method of funding, all as made by the city upon and with the advice of an actuary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any contributions made by the City by a mistake of fact shall be returned to the City, upon its request, within one year after such contribution was made.

    The right of a person to a pension, annuity or retirement allowance, to the return of accumulated contributions, to the pension, annuity or retirement allowance itself, to any optional benefits, and to any other right accruing to any person under this chapter, and the moneys of the retirement system, shall be unassignable and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except as is specifically provided in this chapter. 
(1958 Code,  26-45) 
292.46. - Correction of errors.

If a retiree who retired under subsection (i)(1) hereof dies prior to the earlier of his or her attainment of age 55 or the date upon which he or she would have achieved 25 years of credited service but for the disability, his or her widow or widower, who was his or her legally married spouse at the time of his or her retirement, shall receive a retirement allowance computed according to subsection (k)(1) hereof. In computing the retirement allowance, the retiree's credited service shall be increased to include the period he or she was in receipt of a disability retirement allowance provided in subsection (i)(3) hereof, and his or her final average compensation shall be recomputed using the monthly rates of compensation as of the date of his or her death for the rank or ranks held by him or her during the period used in computing his or her final average compensation at the time of his or her retirement. For Fire Department employees, if the employee incurred the disability while "acting" at a higher rank, the final average compensation of the employee shall be based upon the pay he or she would have received in the "acting" rank for the applicable service period. The widow or widower retirement allowance shall not be less than 20 percent of the retiree's recomputed final average compensation and shall be subject to subsection (k)(3)C. hereof. 
D.  No retirement allowance shall be paid thereunder on account of the death of a retiree if any retirement allowance is paid or payable under subsection (n) hereof on account of his or her death. Any retirement allowance payable under this section shall be subject to subsection (o) hereof. 
(4)  Allowance for spouse of deceased member. If a member, who has ten or more years of credited service, dies on or after the effective date of this revised chapter (September 1, 1966) while in the employ of the City, and leaves a widow or widower, the widow or widower shall receive a retirement allowance equal to one-half of the members accrued retirement allowance computed according to subsection (k)(1) hereof in the same manner in all respects as if the member had retired the day preceding the date or his or her death, notwithstanding that he or she might not have satisfied the applicable provisions of subsection (1) hereof. However, the widow or widowers retirement allowance shall not be less than 20 percent of the member's final average compensation and shall be subject to subsection (o) hereof. No retirement allowance shall be paid or payable under this section on account of the death of a member if any retirement allowance is paid or payable under subsection (n) hereof on account of his or her death. 
(l)  Duty Disability. 
(1)  Generally. Upon the application of a member, or his or her Department head. A member who becomes totally incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of his or her actual performance of duty as a police officer or firefighter in the employ of the City, without willful negligence on his or her part, shall be retired, provided that the Medical Director, after a medical examination of the member, certifies to the Board of Trustees that such member is mentally or physically totally incapacitated for the performance of duty to the City as a police officer or firefighter and that such incapacity will probably be permanent, and provided, further, that the Board concurs with the report of the Medical Director.

Such allowance shall terminate upon his or her attainment of age 55 or, if elected, the date upon which he or she would have achieved 25 years of credited service but for the disability. 
B.  He or she shall receive a retirement allowance computed according to subsection (k)(1) hereof, upon his or her attainment of age 55 or, if elected, the date upon which he or she would have achieved 25 years of credited service but for the disability. In computing such retirement allowance, the member's credited service shall be increased to include the period he or she was in receipt of a disability retirement allowance, and his or her final average compensation shall be recomputed using the monthly rates of compensation as of the date he or she attains age 55 or an earlier date as provided herein, for the rank or ranks held by him or her during the period used in computing his or her final average compensation at the time of his or her retirement.

Any retirement allowance payable under this paragraph shall be subject to subsection (o) hereof. 
C.

(2)  Benefits incurred after meeting voluntary retirement eligibility conditions. Upon a member's retirement after meeting voluntary retirement eligibility conditions as described in subsection (i) hereof, on account of disability as provided in subsection (m)(1) hereof, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance as provided in subsection (k)(1) hereof, subject to subsection (o) hereof.

Such disability retirement allowance shall not exceed two-thirds of the annual rate of compensation of either a full paid police patrol officer or a full paid firefighter as of the effective date of such member's retirement, whichever rate is higher, and shall be subject to subsections (o) and (p) hereof. 
(n)  Death in Line of Duty. 
(1)  Generally. If a member dies as the result of a personal injury or disease arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of his or her employment by the City, or a disability retiree who retired under subsection (l)(1) hereof dies prior to meeting voluntary retirement eligibility conditions as described in subsection (i) hereof, and within five years from and after the date of his or her retirement, and in either case his or her death, or injury or disease resulting in death, is found by the Board of Trustees to have occurred solely and exclusively as the natural and proximate result of his or her actual performance of duty in the employ of the City, the applicable benefits provided in subsections (n)(2) through (n)(10) hereof shall be paid, subject to subsection (n)(7) hereof and subsection (o) hereof. 
(2)  Accumulated contributions. Upon the death of a member, his or her accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund shall be paid in accordance with subsection (q) hereof. 
(3)  Firefighter widow or widower's retirement allowance. A retirement allowance equal to one-third of the final compensation of the deceased firefighter shall be paid to his or her widow or widower, provided that his or her widow or widower was his or her legally married spouse at the time of his or her retirement if his or her retirement as provided in subsection (l)(1) hereof preceded his or her death. Any retirement allowance payable under this subsection shall be subject to subsection (n)(7) hereof and subsection (o) hereof. 
(4)  Firefighter children's benefits while widow or widower is living. If, in addition to a widow or widower, the deceased firefighter leaves an unmarried child or children under age 21, each such child shall receive a retirement allowance of an equal share of one-quarter of the deceased person's final compensation. Upon a child's adoption, attainment of age 21, marriage or death, whichever occurs first, the child's retirement allowance shall terminate and the Board shall redistribute the shares of one-fourth of the deceased firefighter's final compensation to his or her remaining eligible children under age 21, if any. The retirement allowances payable under this paragraph shall be subject to subsection (n)(7) hereof and subsection (o) hereof. 
(5)  Firefighter children's benefits if widow or widower dies or remarries. If there is no widow or widower surviving the deceased firefighter, or if the widow or widower dies, and there is a surviving unmarried child or children under age 21, each such child shall receive a retirement allowance of one-fourth of the deceased firefighter's final compensation, provided that if there are more than two such surviving children, each such child shall receive a retirement allowance of an equal share of one-half of the deceased firefighter's final compensation. Upon a child's adoption, attainment of age 21, marriage or death, whichever occurs first, the child's retirement allowance shall terminate and the Board shall redistribute the shares of one-half of the deceased firefighter's final compensation to his or her remaining eligible children under age 21. In no case shall any such child's retirement allowance be more than one-fourth of the deceased firefighter's final compensation. The retirement allowance payable under this subsection shall be subject to subsection (n)(7) hereof and subsection (o) hereof. A widow's or widower's benefit shall cease upon remarriage for any period of time during which a child's benefit equal to one-half of the deceased firefighter's final compensation is being paid. 
(6)  Firefighter's dependent parents' benefits. If the deceased firefighter does not leave a widow or widower or children eligible to receive a retirement allowance provided in this subsection, there shall be paid to each his or her dependent father and dependent mother, whom the Board, after investigation, finds to have been dependent upon him or her at the time of the firefighter's, a retirement allowance of one-sixth of the deceased firefighter's final compensation. In no case shall the retirement allowance payable to either parent exceed one-sixth of the monthly rate of compensation of either a full paid police patrol officer or full paid firefighter whichever is higher, as of the date of the firefighter's death. Upon the remarriage or death of a parent, his or her retirement allowance shall terminate. Any retirement allowances payable under this paragraph shall be subject to subsection (o) hereof. 
(7)  Firefighter limitations. The total of the monthly retirement allowances provided in subsections (n)(3) through (n)(5) hereof, payable on account of the deceased firefighter, shall not exceed 60 percent of the monthly rate of compensation of either a full paid police patrol officer or a full paid firefighter whichever is higher, as of the date of the firefighter's death. 
(8)  Police officer's surviving spouse retirement allowance. The surviving spouse of a police officer will receive a retirement allowance equal to the greater of 80 percent of the police officer's final average compensation, or 80 percent of the top paid base salary for the rank the police officer held at the time of his or her death. The surviving spouse's benefit will not decrease and is subject to all applicable pension calculation increases with no reductions for surviving spousal benefits. There will be no reduction in benefit if the surviving spouse remarries. 
(9)  Police officer's benefit to surviving children if no surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse and the deceased police officer leaves an unmarried dependent child or children under the age of 21, such child, or each of such children, while he or she remains eligible, will divide and receive an equal share of a retirement allowance equal to the greater of 80 percent of the police officer's final average compensation, or 80 percent of the top paid base salary for the rank the police officer held at the time of his or her death. Such benefit will continue until each child's 21st birthday or marriage, whichever should first occur, at which time that child's benefit will terminate. Any remaining eligible children will equally divide the remaining retirement allowance until the final eligible child reaches the age of 21. 
(10)  Police officer's dependent parents' benefits. If the deceased police officer does not leave a surviving spouse, a child or children eligible to receive a retirement allowance under subsection (n)(1), his or her dependent father and/or dependent mother will receive a retirement allowance equal to the greater of 80 percent of the police officer's final average compensation, or 80 percent of the top paid base salary for the rank the police officer held at the time of his or her death. Upon the death of the dependent parent(s), the retirement allowance will terminate. 
(o)  Workers' Compensation Offset. Any workers' compensation paid or payable on account of the disability or death of a member or retiree shall be offset against any retirement allowance paid or payable by the retirement system on account of the same disability or death. 
(p)  Re-Examination of Disability Retirees. 
(1)  At least once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member with a disability retirement allowance, and at least once in every three-year period thereafter, the Board may require any disability retiree, who has not attained age 55 years or elected the voluntary retirement eligibility conditions as described in subsection (i) hereof, to undergo a medical examination by or under the direction of the Medical Director. Should the disability retiree refuse to submit to such medical examination in any such period, his or her disability retirement allowance may be discontinued by the Board. Should such refusal continue for one year, all his or her rights in and to a disability retirement allowance may be revoked by the Board. 
(2)  If, after a medical examination of a disability retiree, the Medical Director reports to the Board that the disability retiree is physically able and capable of resuming employment with the City as a police officer or firefighter, such disability retiree shall be returned to the employ of the City in the rank he or she held at the time of his or her retirement, or higher rank, and his or her disability retirement allowance shall terminate. A disability retiree who returns to City employment shall again become a member of the retirement system and his or her credited service in force at the time of his or her disability retirement shall be restored to his or her credit. He or she shall be given service credit for the period he or she was receiving a disability retirement allowance under subsection (l)(3) hereof. He or she shall not be given service credit for the period he or she was receiving a disability retirement allowance under subsection (m)(3) hereof. 
(3)  If a disability retiree, who has not met the retirement conditions described in subsection (l)(3)B. hereof, becomes engaged in a gainful occupation, business or employment, and the sum of his or her pay or other remuneration from such occupation, business or employment and his or her disability retirement allowance exceeds the current rate of compensation for the last rank held by him or her, his or her disability retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount which, together with the amount so earned by him or her, shall equal, but not exceed, the current compensation for such rank. Should his or her earnings be later changed, his or her disability retirement allowance shall be adjusted in like manner. 
Each disability retiree shall file, at least annually, a statement of earnings on forms furnished by the Board, together with such supporting schedules as may be requested by the Board to establish a basis for determining earnings for operations of this section. The Board may from time to time adopt rules and regulations for defining remuneration for purposes of application of this section. Refusal by a disability retiree to submit required information upon written request of the Board may, at the discretion of the Board, subject the disability retiree to suspension of allowance payments. 
(q)  Refund of Accumulated Contributions. 
(1)  Should a member leave the employ of the City before he or she has satisfied the age and service requirements for retirement, as provided in subsection (i) hereof, and is not entitled to a retirement allowance or a deferred retirement allowance under subsection (k)(2), he or she shall be paid his or her accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund upon his or her demand in writing to the Board of Trustees. 
(2)  If a former member, who is eligible for a deferred retirement allowance, dies before his or her retirement becomes effective and no retirement allowance becomes payable on account of his or her death to a beneficiary or a beneficiary declines to accept a retirement allowance, except as provided in subsection (n) hereof, his or her accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund, at the time of his or her death, shall be paid to such person as he or she shall have nominated by written designation on the form approved by the Board of Trustees and duly executed and filed with the Board. If there is no such person surviving the deceased member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be paid to his or her legal representative. 
(3)  Payment of refunds of accumulated contributions may be made in installments according to such rules and regulations as the Board may from time to time adopt. 
(4)  If a member who terminates employment elects a refund of contributions and some or all of the refund is eligible for rollover treatment as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, and the member elects to have such eligible distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan or IRA and specifies the eligible retirement plan or IRA to which such distribution is to be paid (in such form and at such time as the distributing plan administration may prescribe), the distribution will be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. 
(r)  Retirement System Funds. 
(1)  Generally. The employees' savings fund, the pension accumulation fund and the retirement reserve fund are hereby established. Effective January 1, 1999, the health insurance fund is additionally established. The Board of Trustees may from time to time establish such other funds as shall be required for the proper operation of the retirement system. The funds shall be held and administered for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the members and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of the retirement system. The entire amount of all moneys paid into the fund shall constitute an irrevocable contribution by the City, and the City shall have no further rights or claims to said funds other than such amounts as remain in the funds upon the retirement system's termination because of erroneous actuarial computations after the satisfaction of all fixed and contingent obligations to the members and their beneficiaries. A balance due to an erroneous actuarial computation shall mean any surplus arising because actual requirements differed from expected requirements based on previous actuarial valuations of liabilities or determinations of costs of providing pension benefits under the retirement system in accordance with reasonable assumptions as to mortality, interest, etc., and correct procedures relating to the method of funding, all as made by the City upon and with the advice of an actuary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any contributions made by the City by a mistake of fact shall be returned to the City, upon its request, within one year after such contribution was made. 
(2)  Employees' savings fund. 
A.  The employees' savings fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated, at regular interest the contributions deducted from the compensations of members, and from which shall be made transfers and paid refunds of accumulated contributions as provided in this section. 
B.  The contributions of a member shall be calculated as a percentage of the member's compensation and paid into the system in the following percentages as provided in this subsection (r)(2)B: police nonsupervisory division members, whose membership commenced before august 1, 2014, shall each contribute nine percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. Police nonsupervisory division members, whose membership commenced on or after August 1, 2014, shall each contribute seven percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. Police supervisory division members, whose membership commenced before August 1, 2014, shall each contribute nine and fifty-two hundredths percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. Police supervisory division members, whose membership commenced on or after August 1, 2014, shall each contribute seven percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. Firefighters, whose membership commenced before May 20, 2014, shall each contribute ten percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. Firefighters, whose membership commenced on or after May 19, 2014, shall each contribute seven percent of the member's compensation paid by the City. The Director of Finance or other officer responsible for making up the payroll shall cause the contributions to be deducted from the compensation of each member on each and every payroll, for each and every payroll period, from the date of his or her entrance in the system to the date his or her membership terminates. 
C.  The contributions provided in this subsection shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be changed thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for in this subsection, and payment of his or her compensations less such deductions shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person, except as to benefits provided under this chapter. When deducted, the contributions of each member shall be paid into the retirement system and shall be credited to his or her individual account in the employees' savings fund. 
D.  In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensations of a member, as hereinbefore provided, he or she shall deposit in the fund, by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution as determined by the Board of Trustees, an amount equal to the amount he or she might have withdrawn therefrom, together with regular interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. In no case shall any member be given credit for service rendered prior to the date he or she withdrew his or her accumulated contributions until he or she repays to the fund all amounts due such fund by him or her. 
E.  Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the retirement reserve fund. At the expiration of a period of five years from and after the date an employee ceases to be a member, any balance standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund that is unclaimed by the member or his or her legal representative shall remain a part of the moneys of the retirement system and shall be transferred to the pension accumulation fund, if no retirement allowance will become payable by the retirement system on account of his or her City employment. 
F.  The employer shall, for tax purposes, pick up the Fire members, Police Supervisory and Police Nonsupervisory Department member contributions required by this section for all compensation earned after the later of the execution or effective date of this subsection (January 1, 1996). The contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code. The employer shall pick up the member contributions from funds established and available in the salaries account, which funds would otherwise have been designated as member contributions and paid to the retirement system. Member contributions picked up by the employer pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other purposes of this and other laws of the employer in the same manner and to the same extent as member contributions made prior to the effective date of this subsection. The member does not have the option of receiving the picked up member contributions in cash instead of having it paid into the retirement system. 
(3)  Pension accumulation fund. The pension accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated reserves resulting from contributions provided by the City. Upon the basis of mortality tables and other tables of experience, and regular interest, as the Board of Trustees shall from time to time adopt, the actuary shall annually compute the retirement allowance reserve liabilities for retirement allowances being paid retirements and beneficiaries and covering service rendered and to be rendered by members. The liabilities so computed shall be financed by appropriations, to be made by Council determined according to this section. The board shall annually report to council the amount of contributions to be paid by the City to the retirement system during the ensuing fiscal year. When paid, the City's contributions shall be credited to the pension accumulation fund. 
A.  The City's appropriations for members' current service shall be a percentage of their annual compensation which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City during the members' periods of future service would be sufficient, together with the future service portions of their accumulated contributions, to provide the retirement allowance reserves for the future service portions of the retirement allowances to be paid them. 
B.  The City's appropriations for members' accrued service shall be a percentage of their annual compensation which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City for a number of years, to be determined by the Board, would amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded retirement allowance reserves, if any, for the accrued service portions of the retirement allowances to be paid them. 
C.  The City's appropriations for retirement allowances being paid retiree and beneficiaries shall be a percentage of the annual compensations of members which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City for a number of years, to be determined by the Board, would amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded retirement allowance reserves, if any, for the retirement allowances being paid retirees and beneficiaries. 
(4)  General fund. The administrative expenses of the retirement system shall be paid by the City from its General Fund. 
(5)  Retirement reserve fund. The retirement reserve fund shall be the fund from which shall be paid all retirement allowances payable as provided in this chapter. Should a disability retiree return to the employ of the City, his or her retirement allowance reserve, computed as of the date of his or her return, shall be transferred from the retirement reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and the pension accumulation fund in the same proportions as the retirement allowance reserve was originally transferred. The portion transferred to the employees' savings fund shall be credited to the member's individual account therein. Each December 31, after receipt of the annual actuarial valuation, the balance in the retirement reserve fund shall be brought into balance with the actuarial present value of retirement allowances to be paid after December 31 to all retiree and beneficiaries in receipt of retirement allowances at December 31, by a transfer between the retirement reserve fund and the pension accumulation fund. 
(6)  Health Insurance Fund. The health insurance fund shall be the fund for receiving contributions for post-retirement health insurance benefits. The initial balance as of January 1, 1998, shall be $3,584,840.14, which amount is equal to the December 31, 1997, asset receivable allocated to health insurance advance funding from the City's general fund. City contributions, as specified in this paragraph, for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, shall be credited to the health insurance fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 294.02(r)(8), the health insurance fund shall be credited investment income at a rate consistent with the method used to determine the actuarial value of assets in the annual actuarial report. Premiums or charges, as specified in this subsection, for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, shall be paid from the health insurance fund. 
A.  Beginning July, 1 1999, the City's annual contribution to the health insurance fund may equal the sum of the actuarially computed normal cost for the year plus an amortization of the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses arising from the experience of active members on or after January 1, 1998. Using an amortization period adopted by the board of trustees for this purpose. However, in no case shall the city's annual contribution to the health insurance fund be less than 2.48 percent of active member payroll, and in no case shall the City's annual contribution to the health insurance fund exceed the limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 401(h) and the regulations thereunder. The amount, if any, by which the contribution must be reduced, in order to comply with the limitation imposed by section 401(h), shall instead be contributed to a voluntary employee's beneficiary association established by the City for this purpose. 
B.  Beginning July 1, 1999, and each year thereafter, a portion of the premiums or charges for post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, shall be paid from the health insurance fund on behalf of eligible retiree and beneficiaries of the retirement system in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreements and personnel rules of the City. The portion of the premiums or charges that will be paid from the health insurance fund is a percentage of such premiums or charges paid on behalf of persons with retirement effective dates on or after January 1, 1999. The percentage shall be four percent in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998, increasing four percent each year thereafter until it reaches 100 percent. The amount of premiums or charges paid from the health insurance fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, paid from a voluntary employee's beneficiary association established by the City for this purpose. Notwithstanding the method specified in this subparagraph to compute the portion of the premiums of charges that are paid from the health insurance fund, the fund balance of the health insurance fund at any point in time is reserved to support the post-retirement health insurance benefits, including dental insurance and Medicare reimbursement benefits, of all eligible retiree and beneficiaries of the retirement system regardless of retirement effective date. 
C.  Notwithstanding the creation or maintenance within the retirement system of the health insurance fund, this section is not to be construed or deemed to have established or removed any benefits, financial or otherwise, subject to Article IX, Section 24 of the 1963 Constitution of the State of Michigan. Nor shall the creation and maintenance of the health insurance fund preclude the City from giving consideration to and implementing cost containment measures as provided by law. Instead, the purpose of this section is to put in place a mechanism for the advance funding of post-retirement health insurance benefits for eligible retiree, and not, apart from the advance funding obligation, to grant additional rights or to take away any rights which eligible retiree may already have. 
(7)  Investment of funds. 
A.  The Board of Trustees shall be the trustees of the funds of the retirement system and may invest and reinvest such funds as now or hereafter permitted by law. The Board may hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer and dispose of any securities and investments in which any of the moneys of the retirement system have been invested, as well as the proceeds of such investments. 
B.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no trustee or officer or employees of the retirement system shall have any direct or indirect interest in the gains or profits of any investments made by the Board. No such person, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or as an agent or partner of others, shall borrow any of the moneys or deposits of the system or in any manner use such moneys or deposits, except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the Board. No such person shall become an endorser or surety or become in any manner an obligor for any moneys loaned by or borrowed from the system. 
(8)  Allowance of regular interest. The Board annually shall allow and credit regular interest on the mean balances in each of the funds of the retirement system for the preceding year; provided, however, that interest to be credited members' individual balances in the employees' savings fund shall be computed on the balances standing to their credit at the beginning of the calendar year and shall be credited at the end of the calendar year, the amounts so allowed and credited shall be paid from interest and other earnings on investments of the system. Any additional amount necessary to allow regular interest, as provided in this system, shall be paid from the pension accumulation fund. AU interest, dividends and other income derived from the deposit and investment of moneys of the system not required for the allowance of regular interest, shall be credited to the pension accumulation fund. 
(9)  Method of making payments. All payments from the funds of the retirement system shall be made according to provisions of the City Charter only upon regular City vouchers signed by two persons designated by the Board of Trustees. A duly attested copy of a resolution of the Board designating such persons, and bearing upon its face specimen signatures of such persons, shall be filed with the City Treasurer as his or her authority to make payments upon such vouchers. No voucher shall be drawn unless it has been previously authorized by a specific or continuing resolution adopted by the Board. 
(s)  Assignments Prohibited. 
(1)  The right of a person to a retirement allowance, to the return of accumulated contributions and to any other benefit provided by the retirement system, and any other right accrued or accruing to any person under this chapter shall be unassignable, except as specifically provided in this chapter. Further, the moneys belonging to the system shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever, and shall be unassignable, except as is specifically provided in this chapter. The City shall have the right of setoff for any claim arising from fraud of or embezzlement by a member, retiree or beneficiary.

(a)  Findings and Recommendations. The City hereby adopts the findings of the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which have respectively found that involuntary smoking (i.e. the exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers, and that environmental tobacco smoke is potentially carcinogenic to occupationally exposed workers. The City further adopts and concurs in the recommendations of the U.S. Surgeon General, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which indicate, respectively, that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within shared air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke, that employers should minimize occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke by using all available preventative means, and that one of the most effective ways to eliminate involuntary exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke is to eliminate smoking in buildings entirely.

(a)  No cable television company shall make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in rates, charges, classifications, promotions, practices, regulations, facilities or services for or in connection with like services, nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever. However, this provision shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graded scale of charges and classification of rates to which any subscriber coming within such classification may be entitled. 
(b)  No rate or charge for cable television service provided in the City shall be effective, and no cable television company shall advertise, collect or receive any rate or charge for its service, until such company has filed a complete schedule of rates and charges with the City Clerk.

The cable television company and the City recognize that the community cablevision service may provide information vital to the community and therefore the monthly and installation rates charged for such service must be approved by Council. 
(d)  No cable television company shall increase any rate or charge for cable television service contained in its filed schedule, or alter any classification, contract, rule, regulation or practice so as to result in any increase in its schedule of rates or charges for such service, without first filing such newly increased rate or charge or alteration in its classification, contract, rule, regulation or practice with the City Clerk at least 30 days before such proposed increase in rates or charges is proposed to become effective, accompanied by a notice and proof of publication thereof for at least one insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, which notice shall state the increase proposed. If the cable television company determines that the increase in the monthly rate for community cablevision is necessary, it shall file an application for a hearing before Council, which shall, within 30 days, hold a hearing on the reasonableness of the rate for the community cablevision service only, and, within 30 days thereafter, approve or disapprove such request. If, after the hearing, Council finds the proposed, increased or changed monthly rate for community cablevision to be unjust or unreasonable, such rate shall be set aside and Council may fix such rates or charges as may be just, reasonable and lawful for the service furnished the public and shall file its conclusions and findings of fact supporting such decision. A copy of the decision shall be served upon the cable television company and the rates and charges so fixed by Council shall be the legal rates and charges until changed as herein provided.

(a)  Every cable television company shall, within 30 days of the grant of a franchise to it pursuant to this chapter, file with the City Clerk, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise, at its expense, a corporate surety bond or such other surety arrangement as Council may approve, in the amount of $100,000.00, conditioned upon the faithful performance by such cable television company of its obligations under its franchise as herein set forth, and upon the further condition that if such cable television company fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any property of such cable television company, as provided in this chapter, plus attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. Such condition shall be a continuing obligation for the duration of any franchise granted under this chapter and any renewal thereof and thereafter until such cable television company has liquidated all of its obligations with the City which may have arisen under the franchise or from the exercise of any privilege or right granted thereby. Any bond provided for under this section shall provide that at least 30 days prior notice of any intention not to renew, to cancel or to make a material change therein shall be filed with the City Clerk. Nothing herein shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by any cable television company or in any way to limit its liability for damages or otherwise. 
(b)  Every cable television company, within 30 days of the grant of a franchise pursuant to this chapter, shall file with the City Clerk, in addition to the bond as set forth in subsection (a) hereof:

Failure to file with the City Clerk, within 30 days after grant of a franchise, the bond, indemnity agreement, proof of a general comprehensive liability insurance policy and proof of adequate workers' compensation insurance, or any of them, as required by subsections (a) and (b) hereof, shall render the franchise null and void without notice or further proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 265, 5-5-71; Ord. No. 307, 9-11-72) 
810.12. - Franchise termination, revocation or surrender. 
(a)  Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall expire, without further proceedings, one year after its effective date if the person granted such franchise has not commenced construction of a cable television system within such period. 
(b)  If any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter fails to provide cable television service within and throughout the franchise area as required under Section 810.13, then such franchise shall, on the anniversary of the effective date of such franchise next following the 12-month period during which cable television service has not been extended as required by Section 810.13, be deemed revoked without the necessity of Council action, unless prior to such date, such person applies to Council and Council, for good cause shown, grants an extension of the construction or service periods set forth in Section 810.13. 
(c)  Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter will be terminated and cancelled, without further proceedings, 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a cable television company, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceedings, unless such receivership or trusteeship has been vacated prior to the expiration of such period. However, such receiver or trustee may apply for a transfer or assignment of such franchise, as provided in Section 810.04(f), within 60 days of the appointment of such receiver or trustee, if duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises. In case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property or facilities of a cable television company, with or without the appointment of a receiver or trustee, including or excluding the franchise granted under this chapter, such franchise as granted will be terminated and cancelled, without further proceedings, upon 30 days written notice of termination served upon the cable television company and the purchaser thereof, unless, within such 30-day period, the purchaser applies to the City for a transfer or assignment to it of the same, as provided in Section 810.04(f). 
(d)  Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter is revocable at will by Council prior to its expiration, where the cable television company has failed substantially to comply with any provision of this chapter. Council may give a written notice containing full particulars as to the provision with which compliance is claimed to be deficient and allow such cable television company 60 days to comply. At the expiration of such 60 days, such franchise will be deemed terminated and revoked, unless such cable television company requests a hearing before Council upon its alleged failure to substantially comply with any provision of this chapter. Such hearing shall be public, with the cable television company being permitted to fully participate therein, including the right to introduce testimony and exhibits and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The hearing shall be stenographically taken and, at the conclusion thereof, Council, if it finds that the cable television company has not substantially complied with any provision or requirement of this chapter, may terminate and revoke the franchise. Such cable television company shall have the same rights of appeal from an adverse decision as are granted by the statutes of the State for appeals from actions of administrative agencies. 
(e)  Any person granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter may surrender it by written notice of intent to surrender such franchise filed with the City Clerk not less than 60 days prior to the surrender date. On the surrender date specified in such notice, all rights, privileges and authority under such franchise shall terminate. However, such person shall have a period of six months thereafter to remove towers, poles, wires, cables, fixtures or other facilities from streets, alleys, public right-of-ways or public places, subject to the rights of the City as set forth in Section 810.07(d).

1022.99. - Penalty. 
Editor's note- See Section 202.99 for general Code penalty if no specific penalty is provided. 
Chapter 1023. - VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDERS 

1023.01. - Purpose. 
(a)  Under the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act, video service providers may obtain a franchise to provide video services in the City using a standardized, Uniform Form of Franchise Agreement established by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). This form includes the right to use the public right-of-way to provide such service but does not contain right-of-way management and related provisions. 
(b)  Telecommunications providers who obtain such a standardized, Uniform Form of Franchise Agreement will usually have a City permit issued pursuant to the Metro Act allowing them to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way. Such Metro Act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such right-of-way usage. Standard forms for such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the MPSC, and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the MPSC. 
(c)  Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities, Metro Act permits generally provide adequate public right-of-way protections for the City and the public when such providers are providing video services. 
(d)  Other video service providers, in particular new providers or existing cable companies, may not have a Metro Act permit issued by the City. 
(e)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, Uniform Franchise Agreement require video service providers to comply with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of public rights-of-way in the delivery of video services. This includes the police powers of the franchising entity, and makes such right-of-way usage subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and the police powers of the franchising entity. 
(f)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, Uniform Franchise Agreement state that franchising entities shall provide video service providers with open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way, and may not discriminate against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in public rights-of-way. 
(g)  The Michigan Constitution reserves reasonable control of their highways, streets, alleys and public places to local units of government. 
(h)  The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public rights-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of such rights-of-way by video service providers who have a standardized, uniform franchise but who lack a Metro Act Permit from the City. This chapter does so by setting forth terms and conditions for the use and occupation of the public's rights of way from the forms of Metro Act Permits as approved by the MPSC and the legislature in Section 6(1) of the Metro Act, thus providing open, comparable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way and not discriminating against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in public rights-of-way.

(c)  Where a developed portion of property lies subjacent to or under any sidewalk, the construction, reconstruction or repair of which is necessary, the responsibility to repair, construct or maintain the sidewalk will remain that of the property owner, unless the property owner executes a release of liability in favor of the City and its contractors or subcontractors, in a form satisfactory to the City, for any property damage occurring as a result of such construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance. 
1024.02. - Sidewalks adjacent to parking lots; barriers required. 
    Where a sidewalk and a parking lot are adjacent to or in close proximity to each other, a barrier and other safety markings approved by the Director of Public Service shall be erected. The barrier shall be such that vehicles are prevented from driving across the sidewalk or from overhanging it when parked. Where such barriers are deemed appropriate, the Director may, after notifying the property owner to erect such barriers, and if such barriers are not erected within ten days of such notice, cause such barriers to be erected and assess the cost to the property owner and, if not paid, against the land upon which the parking lot is situated. 
1024.03. - Resolution for construction or repair. 
    Whenever Council deems that the construction of a new sidewalk or the repair or reconstruction of an existing sidewalk is a necessary public improvement, it shall so declare by resolution. Such resolution shall describe the property in front of or adjacent to which such construction or reconstruction is ordered, by lots, blocks or parcels of land, and shall state that such sidewalk is to be constructed or reconstructed. 
1024.04. - Notice of construction or repair. 
    Whenever Council adopts a resolution deeming it necessary that a new sidewalk be constructed or an existing sidewalk be repaired, the City Clerk shall cause a notice thereof to be published in a newspaper published in the City and directed to the owner of the parcel of land (without naming such owner) in front of or adjacent to which the new sidewalk is to be constructed or the existing sidewalk is to be repaired, requiring such owner to commence construction or repair of the sidewalk within 20 days from the date of publication. Alternatively, the Director of Public Service may mail such notice to the last known address of the property owner, requiring the owner to commence repair or construction of the sidewalk within twenty days from the date of the letter. 
1024.05. - Performance by City. 
    If the sidewalk has not been satisfactorily repaired or constructed at the expiration of twenty days from the last publication of the notice to construct or repair a sidewalk, in the manner provided in Section 1024.04, the Director of Public Service shall cause such sidewalk to be constructed or repaired in accordance with the resolution of Council relating thereto and in the manner required by this chapter and the specifications for such sidewalks as prepared by the City Engineer. 
1024.06. - Responsibilities of contractors; bonds. 
    Every contractor constructing sidewalks and approaches by contract with the City shall construct such sidewalks and approaches in accordance with specifications approved by the City Engineer and shall guarantee such construction against defective workmanship, material or construction for three years from the time such sidewalk is constructed. Every such contractor shall enter into and provide a bond to the City, conditioned on the faithful performance of his or her contract and compliance with this chapter. 
1024.07. - Construction and repair expenses. 
    If the City shall cause a sidewalk to be constructed or repaired by resolution of Council, the expense of such construction or repair, including the cost and expense of departmental administration, attributable to the sidewalk improvement project of which a particular parcel is a part, shall be assessed and levied upon those parcels of land abutting or adjoining the right-of-way or public property wherein the sidewalk is constructed or reconstructed and upon the owner thereof in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 1026, provided, however, that such sidewalk improvement and administrative cost and expense shall also be assessed in accordance with the following: 
(a)  The assessment shall be made on the pro rata share basis that the square footage of the sidewalk constructed or repaired in front of or adjacent to each parcel bears to the square footage of the whole project. 
(b)  The assessment shall be for 50 percent of the pro rata share for new construction of a sidewalk, or 100 percent for repair or replacement of a sidewalk determined by the Director of Public Service, or his or her designee, to have been willfully or negligently damaged by the abutting or adjoining parcel owner or his or her tenants, guests or agents. 
(c)  The assessment shall be for fifty percent of the pro rata share for the repair of an existing sidewalk determined by the Director, or his or her designee, to have been defective due to natural deterioration or aging. 
(d)  No assessment shall be made against the property owner for the repair of any sidewalk damage made by a tree located within the right-of-way or by such tree's roots or for damage made by any direct action of the City. 
(Ord. No. 850, 3-23-92; Ord. No. 1108,  1, 4-24-06) 
1024.08. - Grading of streets prior to sidewalk construction; permit required. 
    No person shall construct or repair a sidewalk on any right-of-way unless it is properly graded. The grade, lines and specifications shall be obtained from the City Engineer upon written application therefor and a permit shall be required before the start of work on any sidewalk. The City Engineer shall grant the permit, in writing, stating in such permit the grade, width, lines and specifications. 
1024.09. - Compliance with City engineer's requirements and specifications. 
    Each person who obtains a permit to construct a sidewalk shall comply with the requirements and specifications given by the City Engineer. 
1024.10. - Construction specifications. 
(a)  Authority of City Engineer. The City Engineer shall prepare specifications prescribing specifically the kind and quality of materials to be used in the construction of any sidewalk under this chapter and the manner and season of constructing such sidewalks. 
(b)  Location; Width; Thickness. Unless the City Engineer determines that the narrowness of the street, shade trees, obstructions or other reasons prevent it, sidewalks shall be laid a distance of one foot from the property line of the adjoining lot or parcel of land. Except as determined by the City Engineer, all sidewalks ordered constructed shall be five feet in width and constructed of Portland cement concrete to a minimum thickness of four inches. 
(c)  Subdrainage. Whenever, in the judgment of the City Engineer, the condition of the soil and the adjoining property is such as to require subdrainage for the proper maintenance of a permanent sidewalk, the Director of Public Service may require such subdrainage as is necessary. Upon failure to do such work by the property owners adjacent to whose property it is decided that such subdrainage is necessary, the Director may cause such subdrainage to be constructed. In the case of new sidewalk construction, the cost may be assessed against such property in the manner provided for the assessment of the cost and expense of constructing sidewalks. Such subdrainage shall be considered a part of the sidewalk and its foundation. 
(d)  Marking. Any person constructing sidewalks or approaches in any right-of-way shall mark each walk or approach with his or her name and with the year in which such walk or approach is built. Letters and figures used in marking shall be not less than one and one-half inches in height and shall be placed in such position on such walk or approach as the Director of Public Service may specify.

1026.03. - Assessment of expense. 
    Whenever Council orders the construction of a mall, promenade or any other public improvement according to this chapter and does not determine by resolution that the whole or some portion of the expense of any such public improvement shall be defrayed by the City or ward, then such expense shall be assessed and levied upon the lots, premises and subdivisions thereof which are in front of, adjacent to or within the district described as especially benefiting from the mall, promenade or other public improvement that may be ordered by Council. 
(Ord. No. 850, 3-23-92)

1026.05. - Reference to improvements or buildings unnecessary. 
    Assessments according to benefits may be made without reference to any improvements or buildings upon the land within a special assessment district. 
(Ord. No. 295, 3-6-72) 
1026.06. - Assessment procedure. 
    The assessment procedure for public improvements assessed according to this chapter shall be as follows: 
(a)  Estimating and Apportioning Cost; Petition for Grading Street. Whenever Council determines that the whole or any part of the expense of public improvements shall be defrayed by an assessment on the lands to be benefited thereby, and to the owners of or the parties in interest thereof, it shall declare the same by an entry in its minutes. After ascertaining, as it may think proper, the estimated or final expense of such improvement, Council shall declare by any entry in its minutes whether the whole, or what portion thereof, shall be assessed to such owners or parties in interest, specifying the sum to be assessed and the portion of the City which it deems to be benefited by such improvements. 
The cost and expenses of making estimates, plans and assessments incidental thereto shall be included in the estimated expense of such improvement. 
(b)  Assessing Costs; Assessment Roll. Pursuant to the order of Council, the City Assessor shall make an assessment roll for the lands within the portion of the City so designated showing the amount of expense, in case of construction of sewers and drains, of the opening of streets or alleys, or of any other improvement, except as hereinafter provided in this subsection, in proportion as nearly as possible to the benefits which each person is deemed to acquire by the making of such improvement, and in case of grading, graveling, paving and all other street improvements, according to foot frontage. The Assessor shall make out an assessment roll which shall include the names of the owners or parties in interest of such lands, as shown from the Assessor's records, the description of the property assessed, and the amount assessed to each person respectively. 
In case any lot or parcel of real estate belongs to a nonresident owner or party of interest, or the owner or party of interest is unknown, the same shall be entered accordingly, with a description of such lot or premises, as is required by law in assessment rolls made by the City Assessor, with the amount assessed thereon. The assessment roll shall be subscribed by the City Assessor and returned within two weeks to Council, unless such time is extended by resolution of Council. 
(c)  Hearings on Assessment Roll. 
(1)  Upon the making and filing of the assessment roll, as required in subsection (b) hereof, Council shall hold a public hearing before the roll is confirmed. 
(2)  The City Clerk shall give notice of hearings in special assessment proceedings to each owner of, or party in interest in, property to be assessed, whose name appears upon the last local tax assessment records, by first class mail addressed to such owner or party at the address shown on the tax records, at least ten days before the date of such hearing. As used in this section, "last local tax assessment records" means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes that has been reviewed by the local board of review, as supplemented by any subsequent changes in the names and addresses of owners or parties listed thereon. Notice given under this subsection shall comply with any mandatory statutory provision governing the same. 
(3)  Where any person claims an interest in real property whose name and correct address do not appear upon the last local tax assessment records, he or she shall be obligated to file immediately his or her name and address with the City Assessor and to provide evidence acceptable to the City Assessor that he or she is entitled to be the taxpayer of record. The Assessor shall immediately enter on the local tax assessment records any changes in the names and addresses of owners or parties in interest filed with him or her and shall at all times keep such tax assessment records current, complete and available for public inspection. 
(4)  On the day appointed for the hearing and on such other days as the hearing may be adjourned to, Council shall receive all written protests and hear the allegations and proofs of all persons who appear and protest the assessment. Council may rectify and amend such assessment roll in whole or in part, or may set such roll aside and direct a new assessment, either by the same person or by such other person as Council appoints for that purpose. In such case, the same proceedings as are herein provided for the first order of assessment shall be conducted for the new assessment, or Council may ratify and confirm such assessment roll without any corrections or with such corrections therein as it may deem proper. 
(d)  Correction of Deficient or Excessive Assessment. If the estimated expense of the improvement was used to establish the special assessment and the special assessment proves insufficient to pay for the improvement or work for which it was levied, and for the expenses incident thereto, Council may, within the limitations prescribed for such assessments, make an additional pro rata assessment to supply the deficiency. If a larger amount is collected than is necessary, the excess shall be refunded ratably to those by whom it was paid. 
(e)  Liens on Property for Assessments. When any special assessment for public, local or other improvements, or for any other purpose authorized by ordinance, has been made, as provided in this chapter, and the tax roll for such assessment is delivered to the City Treasurer for collection, the assessment shall be a lien upon the premises upon which it was assessed from and after the date of the warrant for the collection thereof. The Treasurer may levy on and collect such tax from any personal property in the possession of the person charged with such tax, or in any other manner permitted by law. 
If the assessment is not paid, the Treasurer shall, within five days after the time prescribed by the warrant for the collection thereof has expired, make a report to the City Clerk of the sum and interest, as the case may be, due and so remaining unpaid, which has not been collected, together with a description of the premises assessed for such unpaid taxes. The Clerk, within five days thereafter, shall, in like manner, notify the City Assessor of the amount of such taxes, and the description of the premises assessed and charged with such tax, who shall assess such unpaid taxes on such premises, in the tax roll of the proper ward next thereafter to be made. 
Real property exempt from taxation by law shall nevertheless, with or without valuation, be subject to taxation for special improvements, the same as other property. Such tax or taxes shall then be levied, collected and returned, and the premises may be sold or forfeited for nonpayment of the ordinary City taxes. 
(f)  Interest-Bearing Notes for Street Paving Taxes. Council may direct and authorize the Mayor and the City Clerk to issue and negotiate for and on behalf of the City, not exceeding five percent per annum, interest-bearing notes, with interest at market rates and as shall be permitted by law, free of taxation, for the aggregate amount of any paving taxes, the time for the payment of which has been extended beyond the year of the date of the original warrant for their collection. Such notes shall be made payable at the office of the City Treasurer and fall due at such times as Council shall determine such taxes can be collected, and the proceeds of such notes shall be deposited with the Treasurer, and disbursed thereby on the order of Council, in payment of the cost and expenses of any pavement on account of which such notes have been issued, and for no other purpose whatsoever. The proceeds of such extended taxes, when collected, shall be used for the payment of such notes and for no other purpose whatsoever. 
(g)  Invalid Assessments; Reassessments. Whenever any special assessment to defray the expense of any improvement is invalid, in the opinion of Council, Council may vacate and set the same aside. When any such special assessment is so vacated, or is held invalid by the judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, Council may, from time to time until a valid assessment is made, cause a new assessment to be made for the purpose for which the original assessment was made and in the manner provided for making the original assessment. 
Whenever the tax or any part thereof assessed upon any lot or parcel of real estate by the original assessment set aside or held invalid as aforesaid has been paid, and is not refunded, the City Treasurer shall apply such payment upon the reassessment on the lot or parcel of real estate and make a notation thereof upon the new assessment roll. Such reassessment shall, to the extent of such payment, be deemed paid and satisfied, after which no part of the amount paid on the original assessment shall be refunded, unless the amount paid as aforesaid exceeds the amount of the reassessment, in which case the excess shall be refunded, and the person or his or her legal representative who paid such amount shall be entitled to the amount to be refunded. 
All the provisions of this chapter making special assessments a lien upon the lots and parcels of real estate enforced therein, and also those relating to the collection of special assessments, shall apply to such reassessments. 
This section shall apply to assessments made before, as well as after, the effective date of this section. 
(h)  New Warrants of Collection. Whenever any special assessment has not been collected within the life of the Mayor's warrant affixed to the assessment roll, and is not vacated or held invalid, the Mayor may affix a new warrant to such assessment roll, extending the time for the collection of the assessment so long as Council directs. The Mayor may continue to affix new warrants to any assessment roll, from time to time, under the direction of Council, until the assessment is collected or returned. 
Whenever any special assessment roll is hereafter ratified and confirmed, the time of payment of such special assessment is not extended over a term of years, and such special assessment is not collected within the life of the Mayor's first warrant affixed to such special assessment roll and is not vacated or held invalid, there shall be added to, paid and collected with such tax or assessment on each particular parcel or description of land, or any undivided share thereof, a penalty of four percent at the time of the expiration of the Mayor's first warrant affixed to such roll, together with interest at one-half percent per month, computed from the date of confirmation thereof, until paid or required by law to be returned as delinquent to the County Treasurer. 
(i)  Assessment of Nonresidents' or Unoccupied Lands. The lands of nonresidents and unoccupied lands of the City may be assessed their just proportion of the expenses of all improvements in the City, in the same manner and in the same amounts as assessments for improvements of other lands. 
(j)  Assessment of State Land. The Board of State Auditors shall allow the City moneys in proportion to the assessment upon adjoining property for any improvements made under this chapter upon any street upon which any block or parts of a block of land belonging to the State abut. The Auditor General, on the presentation to him or her of any such account duly allowed, shall draw his or her warrant on the State Treasurer therefor. 
(k)  Application of Section. The provisions of this section are applicable to all public improvements permitted by law, including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, drains, sewers, malls and promenades. 
(Ord. No. 850, 3-23-92; Ord. No. 1208,  1, 4-24-17) 
1026.07. - Installment payments. 
(a)  Warrant for collection of assessments; payments; interest; bond funds. 
(1)  Every assessment ratified and confirmed by Council shall be final and conclusive. Within ten days after such assessment is ratified, the Mayor shall affix to the assessment and the tax roll his or her warrant for collection thereof. The Mayor's warrant shall direct the City Treasurer to collect the assessment on or before the due date, which date shall be 90 days from the date of confirmation by Council. The warrant shall further direct the Treasurer to initiate special assessment collections on the basis of the estimated figure provided by the City Assessor, and such assessment and tax roll, with the warrant of the Mayor so annexed, shall be delivered to the Treasurer within five days after such warrant is annexed to the roll. 
If the Treasurer is unable to collect assessments as directed, he or she may levy and collect any such assessment by distress and sale of any personal property in the possession of the person charged with the assessment or in any other manner permitted by law. 
(2)  For any special assessment ordered pursuant to this chapter , the taxpayer shall have the option of extending the time for payment of the special assessment for a number of years as determined by the Director of Finance for each special assessment roll, not exceeding 20 years or the term of any bond issued, whichever is longer. In determining the number of years, the Director of Finance shall take into consideration the following criteria: 
A.  The term of the bond issued, if any; 
B.  The total amount of the special assessment roll; 
C.  The amount of the largest single assessment within the special assessment roll; and 
D.  Any other factor the director of finance believes is reasonable in determining the duration of installment payments. 
(3)  Both the estimated maximum interest rate, as determined in subsection (a)(6) of this section, and the duration of installment payments shall be published in the notice of public hearing on each assessment roll. 
(4)  Following confirmation of a special assessment roll, a billing of the estimated assessment (original estimated billing) shall be rendered to the taxpayer of record. The words "estimated billing" shall be denoted on the original estimated billing and the total assessment shall be due within 90 days from the date of confirmation. There shall be no interest or penalty charged on any payment or on the entire assessment if paid in full within 90 days from the date of confirmation. 
(5)  The taxpayer may select the installment option by paying the first installment within 90 days of confirmation. 
(6)  For assessments paid in installments under this section, interest will be charged at a rate calculated by the Director of Finance as follows: 
A.  If bonds are issued, assessments shall bear interest at a rate sufficient to permit the city to pay interest on the bonds, but in any event not to exceed one percent above the average bond interest rate. 
B.  On July 1 of each year, or the following business day if July 1 is a not a business day, the Finance Director will establish the interest rate to accrue on assessments for assessment rolls confirmed during that fiscal year if no bonds are issued. The interest rate shall be equal to the ten year federal treasury note rate published on July 1 (or the following business day, if July 1 is a not a business day) in the Wall Street Journal, or, if the Wall Street Journal is not publishing the ten-year federal treasury note rate, such other authoritative source selected by the Director of Finance. 
The interest will be collected on the unpaid principal balance from the original due date to the billing date of the second and subsequent installments. 
To delinquent payments made after 90 days, interest shall be added (adjusted for the number of months between the 91st day and the billing payment date). Interest shall be prorated based on the number of months that have elapsed between the 91st day and any cash or future installment payment made prior to the installment billing date. The second and subsequent installments shall include interest on the unpaid principal balance computed from the prior payment. No interest rate adjustments shall be made once spread, unless such interest has been erroneously computed or bonds are sold after the initial interest computation. 
It shall be the sole responsibility of the Assessor to make all interest computations using the special assessment interest rate calculated by the Director of Finance as provided above. The Assessor shall also determine the final amount to be paid on settlement of a special assessment liability. 
If neither the total assessment nor the first installment is paid within 90 days of confirmation, the taxpayer eligible for installment payments is automatically obligated to pay on the installment basis and is delinquent as to the first installment. A penalty equal to the penalty and interest charged on a delinquent summer tax shall be charged on the first delinquent installment. 
Subsequent installment payments shall be billed July 1, with the due date coinciding with the City's due date for summer taxes, provided that the first two installments shall not become due within a period of less than 120 days of each other. Where the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll occurs less than 120 days preceding July 1 of any year, the second installment shall be due and billed on July 1 one year hence, and succeeding installments annually thereafter on July 1. Succeeding installments in either case shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance at the rate determined in the manner provided in this section. If any installment, other than the first, becomes delinquent, such installment shall be processed in the same manner as a delinquent tax and shall accrue the same penalties and interest as does a delinquent tax. Annual installments will be calculated to and billed on July 1 of each year, regardless of prepayments. 
Payments made in addition to the annual installments shall not be considered as installment prepayment nor relieve the taxpayer of the responsibility of paying any annual installment billed July 1. Scheduled payments shall include principal, determined in the manner provided in this section, and all accrued interest and penalty. 
Prior to any change of ownership of such properties on the installment payment special assessment program, certification must be presented to the Assessor proving that all special assessment taxes have been paid. Alternatively, a notarized agreement signed by the purchaser may be filed with the Assessor, which agreement clearly indicates that the purchaser is assuming the remaining lien. 
(7)  The City Engineer shall begin work or cause work to begin on a special assessment project on or before the first designated due date of a special assessment roll. If for some unavoidable circumstances, the Engineer cannot commence such work within the designated 90 days, he or she shall make a special report to Council stating the circumstances in detail. 
(8)  Once the installment option has been selected, the Assessor shall provide for the accounting function, which function shall allow the special assessment to be paid in approximately equal payments, subject to the installment provisions stated in this section. 
(9)  The City shall have a lien for the total amount of special assessment taxes, interest and penalties, which lien shall attach to the property liable for the same, from and after the date of the warrant for the collection of the whole or any installment thereof, and shall remain until all installments are fully paid. 
(10)  If Council borrows money and issues its bonds to pay for any paving or sewer, for which extension of time of payment of taxes therefor is granted by Council, such taxes annually paid by the property owner benefited, together with such sum raised and collected by the City for such purpose, shall be received and kept by the Treasurer in a special fund to be known as "___________ Street Paving Fund," or "___________ Sewer Fund," and the taxes so collected and placed to the credit of such fund shall be used for the purpose of paying the bonds issued for such paving or sewer, and for no other purpose, and shall be applied as Council directs. 
(b)  Authority of council; interest on unpaid installments. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, Council may grant an extension of time for payment of special assessments by any taxpayer upon the showing of special need or economic hardship, without regard to the use, whether commercial, professional, industrial or otherwise, of the property within a special assessment district. 
Where bonds are issued in anticipation of unpaid installments of such special assessments, the rate of interest on such unpaid installments shall be established at such level as may be permitted by law. 
(c)  Savings clause. All proceedings pending and all rights and liabilities existing, acquired, or incurred under this chapter before passage of Ordinance _____, passed ________, 2007, are saved and may be continued and consummated according to the law in force when they were commenced.

1026.08. - Principal shopping district special assessments. 
(a)  Authority to Make Improvements and Levy Assessments. Council may, in accordance with the City Charter and pursuant to Public Act 120 of 1961, as amended (M.C.L.A. 125.981 et seq), provide for a Principal Shopping District project as a public improvement to develop, to redevelop, to promote economic activity and/or to provide for the maintenance, security and operation of the Principal Shopping District in connection therewith and where such public improvement especially benefits any property within a district, Council may determine, by resolution, that the whole or any part of the expense of such public improvement shall be defrayed by special assessment upon the real property in districts especially benefitted, in proportion to benefits derived. 
(b)  Initiation; determination of Districts. Initiation of special assessments to finance the cost of the whole or any part of the public improvement under this section may be by resolution of Council. Such resolution shall set forth the extent, location and character of any desired public improvement to be provided and shall designate a district that shall contain all real property which Council determines will be especially benefitted by such public improvement. The district may be formed of territory not included on the immediately fronting streets or malls. In such case, diagrams of the plats of such special assessment districts shall be recorded in the office of the City Assessor. 
(c)  Apportionment of Expenses. Whenever Council determines that the whole or any part of the expense of any public improvement is to be defrayed by special assessment upon the property especially benefitted thereby, it shall, after determining the estimated expense of such public improvement, declare by resolution that all, or a specified portion, of such expense shall be assessed upon the properties contained in the assessment district. The cost and expenses of making estimates, plans and assessment incidental thereto may be included in the estimated expense of the assessment. 
(d)  Assessments on Real Property; Making of Assessment Roll. Pursuant to a resolution of Council establishing an assessment district, an estimated amount to be assessed and the proportion of the amount to be assessed, the City Assessor shall make an assessment on all real property within such special assessment district. Such assessment shall be in proportion to the special benefit of the public improvement, to the real property assessed and may be made without reference to any improvement or building upon the land within the special assessment district. The Assessor shall make out an assessment roll in which shall be entered names of persons and the description of the property to be assessed to each person and parcel of property respectively. If any parcel of real property belongs to a nonresident or the owner is unknown, the same shall be entered accordingly with the description of the parcel of property. The assessment roll shall be subscribed by the Assessor and returned to Council within two weeks or by such other time as Council may designate by resolution. 
(e)  Confirmation of Assessment Roll. Upon the return of the assessment roll, the Clerk shall cause notice of a confirmation hearing on such roll to be given, in accordance with Section 1026.06(c). A confirmation hearing shall then be held in accordance with the provisions of Section 1026.06(c). Confirmation of the special assessment roll shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of Council, unless written objection to the proposed special assessment has been filed by owners of property within the special assessment district which, according to estimates, will bear more than fifty percent of the amount of the special assessment, in which case the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of Council is required. Special assessments, once confirmed by Council, shall be final and conclusive. 
(f)  Collection of Assessments. Following the confirmation of a special assessment and the roll thereof the Mayor shall immediately affix his or her warrant for the collection of the assessment to the roll. The warrant shall direct the City Treasurer to collect the assessment forthwith on the basis of the information provided by the City Assessor.

1042.02. - Rates and charges generally. 
    Rates and charges for the use of the sewage disposal system of the City are hereby established. Such charges and rates shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or premises which may have any sewer connection with the sewerage system of the City or which may otherwise discharge sewage or industrial waste, directly or indirectly, into such system or any part thereof. Such charges shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or therein. 
    Except for the infiltration/inflow commodity charge, sewer rates and charges shall not be determined by the amount of water used outside of any structure or building, provided: 
(a)  Such water usage is measured by a meter; and 
(b)  Such water used does not flow directly into the sewage disposal system. 
    All users of the system shall be charged for services. There shall be no free service for any class of user.

1042.04. - User charge system. 
(a)  Method of Charging. The rates and charges for services furnished by the City sewage disposal system shall be levied upon each lot or parcel of land, building or premises having any sewer connection with the system. The rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water used therein, as the same is measured by meters therein used, quality or strength of water discharged, fixed and/or established variable charges per customer, or, in the absence thereof, by such equitable method as shall be determined by the Director of Public Service with the approval of Council, or any combination thereof. 
(b)  Method for Establishing Rates. Council, after holding a public hearing, shall, by resolution, set rates and charges pursuant to the following method and categories of charges: 
(1)  Commodity charge: A pro rata 100 ccf charge as established by meter measurements, for the City to recover the cost of transporting and treating sewage, replacing equipment, making capital improvements and servicing debt of the system. The unit charge shall be the same for all customers. 
(2)  Infiltration/inflow commodity charge: A pro rata 100 ccf charge as established by meter measurement, for the City to recover fifty percent of the total cost for operation, maintenance, replacement, capital improvement and debt service associated with transporting flow volumes generated by infiltration/inflow sources. The unit charge shall be the same to all customers. 
(3)  Infiltration/inflow fixed charge: A charge per customer per month for the City to recover fifty percent of the total cost for operation, maintenance, replacement, capital improvement and debt service associated with transporting flow volumes generated by infiltration/inflow sources. 
(4)  Billing and collection charge: A charge per customer per month to recover the cost associated with meter reading and billing expenses. A charge per customer per month or per quarter to recover the cost associated with meter reading and billing expenses shall be charged by West Side Water for customers it serves. 
(5)  Delayed payment charge: A delayed payment charge equal to a percentage of the unpaid balance of any bill not paid on or before the due date shown thereon, but excluding any other delayed payment charges. 
(6)  Extra-strength waste surcharge for BOD: A charge per pound on all contributed volume in excess of 1.0 million gallons per day and a concentration in excess of 300 mg/l, or a contributed loading in excess of 2,500 pounds per day with a discharge volume less than 1.0 million gallons per day, for City expenses associated with treatment of the extra strength waste. 
(7)  Extra-strength waste surcharge for suspended solids: A charge per pound on all contributed volume in excess of 1.0 million gallons per day and a concentration in excess of 350 mg/l, or a contributed loading in excess of 2,900 pounds per day with a discharge volume less than 1.0 million gallons per day, for City expenses associated with treatment of the extra-strength waste. 
(8)  Industrial pretreatment service charge: A charge per commercial and industrial classified users per month to recover the remaining allocated customer cost associated with the City's industrial pretreatment program (IPP) not recovered by the monitoring charges. 
(9)  Industrial and commercial monitoring charges. 
A.  Composite sample: A charge to recover the City expenses associated with collection of samples over an extended time period by proportion to time or flow rate. 
B.  Grab sample: A charge to recover the City expenses associated with collection of a one-time grab sample. 
C.  Laboratory analysis: A charge per analysis to recover the City expenses associated with conducting the analysis in the laboratory. 
    Such charges shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as provided for the payment of charges for water used, except in cases where the character of the sewage from a commercial, manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that unreasonable additional burden is placed upon the system greater than that imposed by the average sewage delivered to the system plant. In such case, the additional cost of treatment created thereby shall be an additional charge over the regular rates set forth in subsection (b) hereof, or the City may, if it deems it advisable, compel such commercial, manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to treat such sewage in such manner as specified by the City before discharging such sewage into the sewage disposal system. 
    Rates for all users obtaining all or part of their water supply from sources other than the City's water system may be determined by gauging or metering the actual sewage entering the system or by metering the water used, in a manner acceptable to Council. The commodity charge for resident users shall be computed on the basis of 700 cubic feet per month per customer, where gauging or metering is not practical. 
    Council may classify the users of the system according to the quantity and use of the water used, and the quality of the discharge, and charge such rates to users in each class as it may deem reasonable. 
(c)  Effective Date. The rates set forth in this section shall be effective on July 1, 1994, except as otherwise provided. A billing covering use of the system before and after the effective date of a rate change shall be prorated, based upon the average use per day and the number of days within such billing period, at the rate then in effect. 
(Ord. No. 886, 6-27-94) 
1042.05. - Security deposits. 
    The Board of Water and Light may require a cash deposit as security for the payment of sewage disposal service. Such deposit shall be collected pursuant to the same criteria, at the same time and treated in the same manner, as deposits required as security for the payment of water service. The amount of such cash deposit shall be established by written criteria, which criteria shall include the credit worthiness of a customer, delinquency in any past account and other criteria which the board deems relevant. The deposit amount shall be a multiple of the average monthly billing value as determined by the Board. 
(Ord. No. 701, 5-20-85) 
1042.06. - Rules, regulations and bylaws. 
    Council may make such rules and regulations governing the operation of the City sewage disposal system and the collection of service charges as it deems necessary. The Director of Public Service may make such further bylaws, not inconsistent with rules and regulations of Council, as he or she may deem necessary for the management and protection of the system. Such rules, regulations and bylaws shall have the same force and effect as ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75)

Such rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce the needed amounts. An annual audit shall be prepared, and on the basis of such audit, rates for sewer services shall be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to meet system expenses. 
(Ord. No. 800, 6-19-89) 
1042.09. - Notification to users. 
    All users shall be notified annually, in connection with a regular bill, of the current sewer service charge, changes in the sewer service charge and the distribution of the sewer service charge into its subparts (i.e. user charge, debt service charge and service charge). 
(Ord. No. 836, 6-24-91) 
1042.10. - Use of gross revenues. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and in Chapters 1040, 1044 and 1046, gross revenues received by virtue of this chapter shall be set aside and used for the operation, maintenance and extension of the City sewage disposal system and for the payment of bonds and interest thereon issued for the purpose of enlarging and improving such system. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1042.11. - Charges on sewers constructed through letters of intent. 
(a)  Where a sewer, sanitary sewer or storm sewer is constructed by a landowner through a letter of intent wherein such landowner pays the cost of construction and where, upon completion, the sewer so constructed becomes the property of the City and a part of the City's sewerage system, and where a landowner whose land abuts such sewer who did not bear any of the cost of the construction thereof subsequently connects a new or existing structure thereto, such abutting landowner shall be charged for each abutting foot of such sewer in an amount equal to the average per-foot cost of the three public contracts of the City bid during the fiscal year of the letter of intent for the construction of storm sewers of similar diameter and depth. 
(b)  Such charge shall be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for connection and is in addition to any other charge or rate specified in this chapter. The charge provided for in subsection (a) hereof shall be equally divided among the parcels of land specified in the letter of intent, which were to be initially benefited by the sewer. The charges so divided shall be used to reduce, for not more than ten years, any special assessments on such land, or if there are none, to reduce the property taxes on the land. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1042.99. - Penalty.

1044.13. - Payment for repairs. 
    The expense of repairing public sewers, drains, ditches and watercourses may be paid from the General Fund or sewage disposal system funds or in such other manner as Council may prescribe. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.14. - Enactment of ordinances as necessary. 
    Council may enact such ordinances as may be necessary for the protection and control of public drains, watercourses, ditches and sewers, and to carry into effect its powers conferred in this chapter in respect to drainage within the City. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.15. - Furnishing sewerage and drainage to state. 
    Council may afford sewerage and drainage to property owned by the State and shall pay such portion of the expense thereof as may be agreed upon between Council and the Board of State Auditors. Council may enter into any agreement or contract with the Board for paying such proper proportions of the expense of connecting with the sewers and drains of the City as the two parties may mutually deem proper. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.16. - Private construction permits. 
(a)  Required; Issuance. No person within the City shall lay a sewer in any street, alley or other public place or disturb, alter or repair any such sewer or make any hole in or connect with any public sewer, or attempt to do so or cause such work to be done, without first obtaining a written permit therefor. The Department of Public Service is hereby authorized to issue such permits when in its judgment such permits are proper and necessary. Each such permit shall be issued only upon the application of the person having a contract to lay such sewer or make such repairs, alterations or connections, and shall specify the particular parcel of land for which such permit is granted. 
(b)  Payment of Taxes; Fee; Deposit. Such permit shall not be granted without the payment of all special sewer taxes then due and assessed against the property for the benefit of which such connection is to be made. Also, a permit fee determined by resolution of Council shall be deposited with the Department of Public Service. If the sewer installation must cross a public street or alley or other public property, a deposit of sufficient amount, as determined by the Department, to cover the actual cost of repairing such property shall be required before such permit is granted. After making such deposit, and receiving such permit, the trench or excavation may be made as specified in the permit. 
1044.17. - Supervision and specifications of connections. 
    After excavation is made, but before any connection is made with a public sewer or any hole made therein, or before such public sewer is disturbed other than being uncovered, notice shall be given to the Department of Public Service, which shall immediately cause an inspector or assistant thereof to supervise the making of such connection or the laying of such sewer from the public sewer to within three feet of the building concerned. The Department may require or permit local sewers larger than four-inch pipe, but such local sewer shall be of the same size as the connection with the public sewer. All detached buildings, dwellings and duplexes shall have a distinct and separate connection to the public sewer in the street, except that all apartment houses, townhouses, condominiums, school buildings and factory and industrial buildings may have one or more connections to public sewers. Such connections, however, shall be of a size and at points determined and designated by the Department. 
(Ord. No. 654, 8-8-83) 
1044.18. - Refilling excavations; costs. 
    After the making of connections and the laying of a sewer to within three feet of a building, the refilling of the trench or excavation shall be done under the supervision of the Department of Public Service, and such refilling shall not proceed unless an inspector from the Department or his or her assistant is present. 
    Any person laying a sewer in any public space shall, as speedily as possible, refill the excavation and put the same in as good condition as before. In order to do so, the filling is to be replaced carefully in layers and each layer, before the next is put on, shall be thoroughly flushed so as to make such filling, when complete, sufficiently firm, compact and solid to prevent settling. However, in case of a street, alley or other paved space, such trench or excavation shall be refilled and repaved by the Director of Public Service or his or her assistant, or under his or her immediate supervision. 
    The Department or its inspector (and the Director of Public Service in case of a paved space) shall keep or cause to be kept an accurate account of the cost of inspection, labor and material expended and used in such work, which cost shall be borne by the person having obtained the permit for the work, and such cost shall be deducted from the amount of the deposit made for such purpose. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.19. - Additional deposit. 
    If, in the judgment of the Department of Public Service, the sum required to be deposited under Section 1044.16(b) (in case of a paved street, alley or space) is not sufficient to cover the probable cost of such work, the Director of Public Service may require such deposit as will, in his or her judgment, be sufficient to cover such cost. On the completion of such work, any balance shall be returned to the person entitled thereto, and in case of a deficiency, such person shall pay the balance due to the Department. However, no person shall be required to make such deposit with the Department if he or she secures permission to make connection with any public sewer, as provided in Section 1044.16, and executes a bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in the State in such penal sum to be approved by Council, conditioned on the faithful observance of the City Charter and of ordinances and such other conditions not inconsistent with this chapter, as Council may from time to time prescribe. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.20. - Compliance with rules and regulations. 
    All rules and regulations approved by Council for the construction and care of main and local sewers, connecting sewers and private sewers shall form a part of this chapter and shall be as binding and lawful as any part thereof. No person shall fail to comply with any such rule or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 408, 12-1-75) 
1044.99. - Penalty.

1046.01. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate industrial waste pretreatment facilities and the discharge of industrial waste into the City's publicly operated treatment works and to provide for pollutant limitations, data collection, monitoring and sampling and for penalties for the violation thereof for the following purposes: 
(a)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City's wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or contaminate the resulting Municipal sludge; 
(b)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City's wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the publicly owned treatment works and which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(c)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system; and 
(d)  To provide for the recovery of costs from users of the publicly owned treatment works for the implementation of the program established in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.02. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise: 
    The Act means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.

    Approval authority means the Director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), or his/her duly authorized representative. 
    Authorized representative of industrial user means: 
A.  A principal executive officer of at least the level of vice-president, if the industrial user is a corporation; 
B.  A general partner or proprietor, if the individual user is a partnership or proprietorship, respectively; or 
C.  A duly authorized representative of an individual designated in paragraphs (4)A. and B. hereof, if such representative is responsible for the overall operation of the facilities from which the indirect discharge originates or for environmental matters of the company. Authorization for this representative must be submitted in writing to the City by the individual designated in [subsection] A. or B. above. 
    Average limit means the maximum allowable average daily discharge of a pollutant during a given time period and calculated as the sum of all daily discharge measurements during the period divided by the number of daily measurements. 
    Best Management Practices or BMPS mean schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management actions. Best management practices also include treatment requirements; operating procedures; and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. 
    Biochemical oxygen demand or BOD means the quantity of oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedure in five days at twenty degrees Centigrade expressed in terms of weights and concentration (milligrams per liter). 
    Building sewer means a sewer conveying wastewater from the premises of a user to the POTW. 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
    Categorical standards means national categorical pretreatment standards. 
    Chemical oxygen demand or COD means a measure of the oxygen-consuming capacity of inorganic and organic matter present in water or wastewater. It is expressed as the amount of oxygen consumed from a chemical oxidant in a specific test. It does not differentiate between stable and unstable organic matter and thus does not necessarily correlate with biochemical oxygen demand. "Chemical oxygen demand" is also known as OC and DOC, oxygen consumed and dichromate oxygen consumed, respectively. 
    Combined waste stream means the waste stream at industrial facilities where regulated process effluent is mixed with other wastewater, either regulated or unregulated, prior to or at the point of treatment. 
    Compatible pollutant means a substance amenable to treatment in the wastewater treatment plant, such as biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, pH and fecal coliform bacteria, plus additional pollutants identified in the NPDES permit if the publicly owned pretreatment works was designed to treat such pollutants and in fact does remove such pollutants to a substantial degree. 
    Composite sample means a series of sample aliquots collected separately using a flow-proportional sampling technique, an alternate time-based sampling technique, or a grab-based sampling technique, and combined into one sample prior to analysis. A flow-proportional composite sample is one in which numerous sample aliquots are collected at a rate directly proportional to the wastestream flow. An alternate time-based sampling technique is one in which numerous sample aliquots are collected at regular time intervals regardless of the wastestream flow. An alternate grab-based sampling technique is one in which a limited number of sample aliquots are collected at specific times. 
    Cooling water means the water discharged from any use such as air conditioning, cooling or refrigeration, to which the only pollutant added is heat.

    Integrated facilities means industrial facilities with a combined waste stream. 
    Interference means the inhibition or disruption of the POTW treatment processes or operations which contributes to a violation of any requirement of the City's NPDES permit or reduces the efficiency of the POTW. "Interference" includes the prevention of sewage sludge use or disposal by the POTW. 
    Laboratory determination means the measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and waste in accordance with the methods contained in the latest edition (at the time) of any such measurements, tests or analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes in accordance with the methods contained in 40 C.F.R. 136, as amended, or in accordance with any other method prescribed by the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter.

(c)  Detectable mercury may be discharged only where specifically approved and permitted by the Director pursuant to the following conditions: 
(1)  Each user discharging detectable mercury shall have a city-accessible point for monitoring the net non-domestic effluent. All costs for installation of this monitoring point shall be the user's responsibility. 
(2)  Each user discharging detectable mercury shall self-monitor its effluent for mercury using representative samples collected over the period of normal discharge and tests conducted in accordance with the city-required method, at a frequency to be established by the Director. While the user may contract with the City or an outside consultant/laboratory to conduct this sampling and analytical testing, all associated costs shall be the user's responsibility. 
(3)  At its discretion, the City may collect additional samples from each user discharging detectable mercury. If the user contracts with an outside consultant/laboratory to perform the self monitoring, the City will perform surveillance sampling at least annually. If the user contracts with the City to perform the self monitoring, this annual surveillance requirement may be waived. 
(4)  Each user discharging detectable mercury shall develop and implement a mercury minimization program to establish actions and schedule commitments for reducing mercury entering the collection system. A program plan, which shall be submitted to the City for review and concurrence, shall address the following at a minimum:

(iv)  Review, and elimination where feasible, of purchased materials containing mercury; and 
(v)  Other activities as deemed appropriate by the user or required by the Director. 
(5)  The mercury minimization plan shall be considered an enforceable condition of the associated permit or order. Failure to comply with these conditions may result in escalated enforcement response including fines, legal action, and termination of sewer services. 
If the Director determines that all reasonable cost-effective actions based on economic, technical, and treatability considerations have been implemented, a discharge containing detectable mercury may be approved contingent on continuation of the self-monitoring program and the mercury minimization program. This approval shall be considered temporary, and the Director has the right to reject this approval and prohibit detectable mercury from any discharger at any time and for any reason deemed appropriate. 
(d)  Special allocation limits. For any discharge that would otherwise be prohibited by subsection (a) or (b) hereof, a special allocation limit (SAL) may be granted by user permit or administrative order for any pollutant other than mercury. 
(1)  The following general conditions shall apply to all SALS: 
(i)  Shall be made at the sole discretion and prior approval of the Director. 
(ii)  May be implemented as daily maximum limits for a composite sample (or a grab sample for cyanides, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes, and total phenols) or instantaneous limits for any sample. 
(iii)  May be terminated or modified at any time by the Director. 
(iv)  Shall create no rights which the user would not otherwise have. 
(v)  Shall require the user to sign an acceptance of the provisions of this subsection and any special arrangement provisions as a condition precedent to the granting of a SAL. 
(vi)  May be established by calculations based on current user discharge data or by arbitrary assignment using best available technology, professional judgment, and/or local economic policy decisions. 
(vii)  Shall apply appropriate maximum daily flows established using water meter, batch discharge, and/or effluent flow meter records. Any user permit or order containing a SAL shall contain a flow limit corresponding to the specific value on which the SAL was established, and also shall contain a requirement to accurately collect and report actual discharge flows. 
(viii)  May take into account reasonable cost of treatment to avoid undue hardship for the affected user. 
(ix)  Shall not be less restrictive than any applicable categorical standards, but may be more restrictive.

At the request of the City, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide such protection shall be submitted to the City for review. All required users shall complete such a plan within ninety days after notification by the City. If required by the City, a user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 698, passed April 8, 1985), shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. The City will evaluate, at least once every two years, whether an industrial user without such protection will be subjected to these requirements. In the case of an accidental discharge or other discharge that could cause problems at the POTW, including slug load discharges, the user shall telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. Such notification shall occur as soon as possible, but in no case more than 24 hours after the user becomes aware of the accidental or other discharge that could cause problems at the POTW. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and correction actions. 
(b)  Within five days following such accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Director of Public Service a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any fine, civil penalty or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable laws. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of the user who to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(d)  A bypass violating applicable pretreatment standards and requirements is prohibited, and the City may take enforcement action against a user for such bypass, unless: the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime (except where adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to operate during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance); and the user submitted required notices. For accidental bypass, notice requirements are specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) hereof. If the user knows in advance of the need for bypass, a prior notice shall be submitted to the City at least ten days before the date of the bypass. The City may approve or disapprove this anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects. 
(e)  An upset may constitute an affirmative defense by the user in unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, provided it can be proved that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause; 
(2)  The facility was, at the time of the upset, being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operational and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The user submitted the required notifications in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) hereof. 
    In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

Any user subject to BMP-based pretreatment standards and requirements shall report necessary BMP compliance information. In addition, such report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported under Section 1046.12(c). At the discretion of the Director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc, the Director may agree to require different months during which such reports are to be submitted. 
    The Director may also impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases in which the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by this subsection shall also indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. 
    If a user subject to these reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the City, using approved procedures, the results of this additional monitoring shall also be included in the reports. 
(d)  Notice of changed conditions. Each user shall notify the POTW in advance of any significant changes planned for the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater, including the potential for a slug load discharge. The Director may require the user to submit information considered necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including submission of a new wastewater discharge permit application. The Director may also issue the user a new wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing permit in response to the changed conditions. 
(e)  Notice of potential problems. For accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine or episodic nature, non-customary batch discharges, emergency bypasses, upsets, and/or slug load discharges, user notification requirements are as specified in Section 1046.08. 
(f)  Notice of violation and repeat sampling. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and submit the results of re-analysis to the City within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except when the City will be performing scheduled surveillance sampling/analysis within this 30-day period. If sampling is performed by the City on behalf of the user, the City will either repeat the sampling within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation or immediately notify the user of the requirement to repeat the sampling within 30 days. 
(g)  Notice of hazardous waste discharge. All users shall also notify the POTW, the EPA and the State Hazardous Waste Authority, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. 261 if disposed via other means. Notification details, as well as allowable exemptions, shall be in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.12(P). In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must provide notification of the effective date of such regulations. In the case of any notification of hazardous waste discharges, the user shall further certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(h)  The reports required by this section shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and shall include the following certification statement: 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
    If the authorized representative changes because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or for environmental matters of the company, a new authorization, satisfying the requirements of the definition contained in Section 1046.02, must be submitted to the City prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the authorized representative. 
(i)  Non-domestic users shall report any changes to information in compliance reports to the POTW within 60 days. 
(Ord. No. 887, 7-5-94; Ord. No. 1054,  1, 9-30-02; Ord. No. 1175,  1, 10-10-11) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1175,  1, adopted Oct. 10, 2011, amended  1046.13 title to read as herein set out. Former  1046.13 title pertained to compliance reports. 
1046.14. - Monitoring facilities and techniques. 
(a)  The City may require to be provided and operated, at a user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with plans and specifications submitted to and approved by the City and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. When required, construction of such facilities shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the City. 
(b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(c)  All sampling and analytical testing shall be in accordance with protocols, including appropriate preservation, specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate USEPA guidance. Where such protocols and guidance do not include a given pollutant, the user may apply methods subject to prior acceptance of the City. 
(d)  For composite samples, the user shall use a flow-proportional sampling technique unless an alternate time-based or grab-based sampling technique is authorized by the Director. The user seeking an alternate sampling technique shall submit a request to the City in writing, and shall have the burden of demonstrating that the alternate sampling technique will be representative of the discharge. The decision whether to allow an alternate sampling technique will be at the Director's discretion, and the basis for this decision will be documented in the City's file for that user. 
(e)  Grab samples shall be used for assessing compliance of oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds. For compliance reports, the user shall collect the number of grab samples necessary to properly assess its compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements except as follows: for sampling associated with a 90-day compliance report or baseline monitoring report, a minimum of four daily grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds where historical sampling data does not exist; where historical sampling data does exist, the Director may authorize a lower number of samples. The user may use multiple grab samples for sampling associated with a 90-day compliance report or baseline monitoring report provided they are collected during a 24-hour period and composited prior to the analysis according to the following basis: 
(i)  Composited in the field or the laboratory for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides; 
(ii)  Composited only in the laboratory for volatile organics and oil and grease; and 
(iii)  Composited as authorized by the Director for other parameters. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85; Ord. No. 1175,  1, 10-10-11) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1175,  1, adopted Oct. 10, 2011, amended  1046.14 title to read as herein set out. Former  1046.14 title pertained to monitoring facilities. 
1046.15. - Inspection and sampling. 
(a)  The City shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether or not the purposes of this chapter are being met and all requirements thereof are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying or otherwise for the performance of his or her duties. The City, the MDEQ and the EPA may set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, the MDEQ and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. While performing the aforementioned work on private premises, City representatives shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury to or death of City employees while performing such work. The City shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by City employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except such as may be caused by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions, as required in Section 1046.14. 
(b)  The City will evaluate all significant industrial users for the need for a slug control plan within one year of that user being designated as a significant industrial user. The City will also reevaluate the need for a slug control plan when notified by a user of a change in the slug load discharge potential. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85; Ord. No. 1175,  1, 10-10-11) 
1046.16. - Pretreatment; publication of violators' names. 
(a)  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations specified by Federal pretreatment regulations and required by the City. Industrial users with integrated facilities shall comply with any alternative discharge limits as set by the City. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review at the request of the City. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under this chapter. Any subsequent change in pretreatment facilities or methods of operation shall be reported to the City prior to the user's initiation of such change. 
(b)  The City shall annually publish in the major local newspaper a list of all users who were in significant violation of any applicable pretreatment requirements or standards during the twelve previous months. Such notification shall also identify the nature of the violation and summarize any enforcement actions taken against such users during such period. 
(c)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or the MDEQ upon request. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85; Ord. No. 1175,  1, 10-10-11) 
1046.17. - Confidentiality of information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public or any governmental agency without restriction, unless the user specifically requests otherwise and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
    When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portion of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES permit or pretreatment programs. However, such portion shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
    Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the City until and unless a ten-day notification thereof is given to the user. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.18. - Suspension of service for harmful discharges. 
    The City may suspend wastewater treatment service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, which causes interference to the POTW or which causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
    A person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. If the person fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individual. The City shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within fifteen days of the date of the occurrence. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.19. - Notification of violation. 
    Whenever the City finds that any user has violated or is violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any prohibition or limitation of requirements contained in this chapter, the City may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty days of the date of such notice, the user shall submit to the City a plan for the satisfactory correction of such violation. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.20. - Hearings. 
(a)  A user who is subject to enforcement action under this chapter may request a hearing before the Director of Public Service within ten days of receipt of notification of the proposed enforcement action. Such hearing shall concern the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken and the proposed enforcement action and shall direct the user to show cause before the Director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
(b)  The Director may conduct the hearing and take the evidence or may designate any officer or employee to: 
(1)  Issue, in the name of the Director, notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 
(2)  Take the evidence; and 
(3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and the hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendation to the Director for action thereon. 
(c)  At any hearing held pursuant to this section, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, shall be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(d)  After the Director has reviewed the evidence, he or she may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed on existing treatment facilities and unless such devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(e)  The Director shall also establish appropriate surcharges or fees to reimburse the City for additional costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment works due to the violation. 
(f)  Any action by the Director may be appealed to Council. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.21. - Legal action. 
    If any person discharges sewage, industrial waste or other waste into the City's wastewater disposal system contrary to any of the provisions of this chapter, any Federal or State pretreatment requirement or any order of the City, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal relief as set forth below: 
(a)  Civil litigation will be deemed appropriate in the following circumstances: 
(1)  A potential emergency situation which, if unabated, threatens harm to the human health, the environment, or the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) system; 
(2)  When previous formal enforcement efforts, such as a notification of violation (NOV) or an administrative order to show cause (AOSC), have failed to force action on returning a discharger to compliance; or 
(3)  When the City seeks to recover losses incurred due to a noncompliant discharge, or to assess civil fines. 
(b)  Criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor will be deemed appropriate when evidence exists that a major violation or emergency has occurred with criminal intent, severe recurrence, or major aggravation. Such action will be warranted when the user either intended to breach the law or was so indifferent to the nature or implications of its actions to be criminally negligent. Once the evidence is collected and a decision is made to proceed with prosecution, the City Attorney will present the evidence to the County Prosecutor. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85; Ord. No. 1054,  1, 9-30-02) 
1046.22. - Records of users. 
    All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve, for not less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereto, relating to monitoring, sampling, chemical analyses, and compliance with any BMPS made by or on behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the City pursuant to this chapter shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85; Ord. No. 1175,  1, 10-10-11) 
1046.23. - Falsification; tampering with monitoring device. 
    No person shall knowingly make any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter. No person shall falsify, tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 698, 4-8-85) 
1046.99. - Penalty. 
    In addition to the penalty provided in Section 202.99, the City may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation, by appropriate suit at law, against any person found to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any order, rule, regulation or permit issued hereunder. The City has legal authority to seek or assess civil fines in at least the amount of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars per day pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(A), or criminal penalties in at least the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) a day for each violation of applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

1052.04. - Stormwater rate methodology. 
    All properties in the City of Lansing, except street rights-of-way, shall be charged in accordance with one of the two methods described in this section. 
(a)  Calculation of Annual Revenue Requirement and Annual Base Rate. 
(1)  The Public Service Department will, from time to time, propose the amount of dedicated annual revenue required to meet stormwater system needs, pursuant to Section 1052.03, to the City Council. 
(2)  The Public Service Department will determine the total billable equivalent hydraulic area (EHA) for all properties in the City. The Department will then divide this area by 1,000 to determine the total billable EHA units, expressed in 1,000 square feet. 
(3)  The Public Service Department will calculate the base rate by the annual revenue requirements as stated in paragraph (a)(1) hereof by the EHA units as stated in paragraph (a)(2) hereof. The result of this calculation will be the base expressed rate, in dollars per 1,000 square feet of equivalent hydraulic area (EHA). 
(b)  Calculation of Annual Bills. Individual bills shall be calculated by multiplying the base rate times the EHA of the parcel expressed in 1,000 square feet. The EHA of the parcel shall be determined based on one of the two parcel categories as described below: 
(1)  Flat rate parcels. The Public Service Department shall determine the equivalent hydraulic unit for the size of residential properties as listed below. These properties will not be individually measured. The table below lists the EHA for developed and undeveloped parcels of each of four size ranges, as follows: 
Parcel Size 
(sq. ft.) Developed Parcel 
(EHA) 
(1,000 sq. ft.) Undeveloped Parcel 
(EHA) 
(1,000 sq. ft.) Up to 3,500 1.498 .306 3,501 to 7,000 2.493 .768 7,001 to 10,500 3.525 1.294 10,501 to 2 acres 5.007 3.675  
(2)  Measured parcels. For all parcels of land that are classified as commercial, industrial or residential parcels over two acres, the EHA shall be computed as follows: 
The EHA for an individual parcel shall be calculated by multiplying each parcel's pervious and impervious areas by the following runoff factors: 
Pervious area .15 
Impervious area .95 
    The areas adjusted by the previous calculation will be added together to determine the parcel's EHA. The result of this calculation will be expressed in 1,000 square feet. 
(Ord. No. 925, 10-9-95) 
1052.05. - Date of annual charge. 
    The charges levied under this chapter shall be charged on December 1 of each calendar year. 
(Ord. No. 925, 10-9-95)

Parcel Size 
(sq. ft.) Developed parcel 
Annual Rate Undeveloped parcel 
Annual Rate Up to 3,500 $ 35.95 $ 7.34 3,501 to 7,000   59.83  18.43 7,001 to 10,500   84.60  31.06 10,501 to 2 Acres  120.17  88.20  
    For measured parcels, the annual stormwater service charge shall be calculated by multiplying the parcel's EHA by twenty-four dollars ($24.00) per 1,000 square feet of equivalent hydraulic area. 
(b)  The service charges established pursuant to the methodology provided for in Section 1052.04 may be revised from time to time as the needs of the Stormwater Enterprise Fund require. 
(c)  The Stormwater Enterprise Fund shall be operated on the basis of a fiscal year commencing July 1 and ending June 30. 
(Ord. No. 925, 10-9-95) 
1052.07. - Billing. 
    The billing for stormwater service shall be sent to the property owner or the owner's designee and may be sent individually or sent with December property tax statements. The basis for billing shall be computed by the Public Service Director or his or her designee. 
(Ord. No. 925, 10-9-95) 
1052.08. - Appeals; board of public service as review board.

    Certificate of appropriateness means the written approval of a permit application for work that is appropriate and that does not adversely affect a resource. 
    Certificate of financial hardship means a certificate issued which authorizes an alteration, construction, removal, or demolition of a district resource, notwithstanding whether a certificate of appropriateness has previously been denied. 
    Commission means the Lansing Historic District Commission appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by City Council. 
    Committee means a Historic District Study Committee appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by City Council. 
    Demolition means the razing or destruction, whether entirely or in part, of a district resource within a designated Historic District and includes, but is not limited to, demolition by neglect.

    District resource means a site, building, structure, object, open space or feature to be found individually or in a related group within a Historic District. Specifically: 
A.  "Site" means a district resource that is related to important historical events, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, an institution or organization or an architectural district resource that is ruined or vanished, where the location itself maintains historical value regardless of the value of any existing architectural district resources. Examples: park, cemetery, courtyard square, designed garden.

    Property owner means any individual, business or association having legal or equitable title in real property. 
    Proposed Historic District means an area or group of areas, not necessarily having contiguous boundaries, that has delineated boundaries and that is under review by a committee or a standing committee for the purpose of making a recommendation as to whether it should be established as a Historic District or added to an established Historic District. 
    Reconstruction means the process of reproducing by new construction the exact form and detail of a vanished district resource, or part thereof, as it appeared at a specific time. 
    Rehabilitation means the process of returning a property to a state of utility, through repair or alteration, which makes possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving those portions and features of the property which are significant to its historic, architectural and cultural values.

1220.03. - Procedure for establishment. 
(a)  Historic Districts shall be established by ordinance. The Historic District Commission shall oversee studies and research and make reports on the historical and architectural significance of districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects, open spaces and features in the City. The Historic District Commission shall be assisted in carrying out its duties by the staff of the Planning Division, including the giving of required notices and the keeping of records. 
(b)  Requests to establish a Historic District may be made to Council by the Historic Districts Commission or by any property owner or other person or legal entity. After a request is received, Council, by resolution, may schedule a public hearing and/or a public meeting and give by mail at least ten days advanced written notice of the public hearing and/or public meeting to all property owners in the requested Historic District. Thereafter, prior to establishing a Historic District, Council must first, by resolution, approve the formation of a Historic District Study Committee. This Committee shall have local historic organization representation and shall contain a majority of persons who have a clearly demonstrated interest in or a knowledge of historic preservation. Property owners within the proposed district of more than eight properties shall make up at least 33 percent of the Study Committee. Members of the Study Committee may be recommended by the Historic District Commission to the Mayor. The Mayor shall make Committee appointments with Council approval. The Committee shall do all of the following: 
(1)  Conduct a photographic inventory of resources within each proposed Historic District following procedures established or approved by the Department. 
(2)  Conduct basic research of each proposed Historic District and the historic resources located within that District and provide owners of the individual historic properties under consideration with a mailing inviting written comments and forward any comments received to council with the preliminary report. 
(3)  Determine the total number of historic and non-historic resources within a proposed Historic District and the percentage of historic resources of that total. In evaluating the significance of historic resources, the Committee shall be guided by the selection criteria for evaluation issued by the United States Secretary of the Interior for inclusion of resources in the National Register of Historic Places, as set forth in 36 CFR Part 60, and criteria established or approved by the Department, if any. 
(4)  Prepare a preliminary Historic District Study Committee report that addresses, at a minimum, all of the following: 
A.  The charge of the Committee. 
B.  The composition of the Committee membership. 
C.  The Historic District or Districts studies. 
D.  The boundaries for each proposed Historic District, in writing and on maps. 
E.  The history of each proposed Historic District. 
F.  The significance of each District as a whole, as well as a sufficient number of its individual resources to fully represent the variety of resources found within the District, relative to the evaluation criteria. 
Within 180 days from the date of its establishment by City Council resolution, the Study Committee shall issue its preliminary report. Extensions for issuance of the preliminary report may be granted by City Council upon written request from the Study Committee before the elapse of 180 days from the date of the original resolution. 
(5)  Transmit copies of the preliminary report for review and recommendations to the Lansing Planning Board, the Department, the Michigan Historical Commission and the State Historic Preservation Review Board. 
(6)  Make copies of the preliminary report available to the public. 
In compliance with the requirements of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, the Committee shall hold a public hearing not less than 60 calendar days after the transmittal of the preliminary report and after notice is given. Written notice shall be mailed by first-class mail, not less than 14 calendar days before the hearing, to the owners of the properties within the proposed Historic District, as listed on the City Assessor's tax records. 
(c)  The Committee and Council shall be required, in a time period not to exceed one year after the public hearing date, unless otherwise authorized by Council to take the following actions: 
(1)  The Committee shall prepare and submit to Council a final report, with its recommendations and the recommendation, if any, of the Planning Board and the Historic District Commission. If the recommendation is to establish a Historic District or Districts, the final report shall include a draft of a proposed ordinance or ordinances. 
(2)  After receiving a final report that recommends the establishment of a Historic District or Districts, Council, at its discretion, may introduce and pass or reject an ordinance or ordinances. If Council passes an ordinance or ordinances establishing one or more Historic Districts, the City Clerk shall file a copy of that ordinance or those ordinances, including a legal description of the property or properties located within the Historic District or Districts, with the Register of Deeds. Unless all of the affected property owners concur in the passage of the ordinance and provide a written waiver of the 60 day delay, Council shall not pass an ordinance establishing a contiguous historic district less than 60 days after a majority of the property owners within the proposed Historic District, as listed on the tax rolls of the City, have approved the establishment of the Historic District pursuant to a written petition, pursuant to Section 3 of Act 169 of the Public Acts of 1970, as amended, being MCL 399.203. However, such a petition shall not be a prerequisite to modify or eliminate a Historic District as the City Council may otherwise determine. 
(3)  A writing that is prepared, owned, used or retained by, or in the possession of, a committee in the performance of an official function, shall be made available to the public in compliance with the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. 
(d)  Council may, at any time, establish by ordinance additional Historic Districts, including proposed Districts previously considered and rejected, may modify boundaries of an existing Historic District, or may eliminate an existing Historic District. Before establishing, modifying or eliminating a Historic District, the City shall notify the property owners in the Historic District in the manner provided in Subsection 1220.03(b) and a Historic District Study Committee shall be established, as set forth in Section 1220.03(b), to consider any previously written committee reports pertinent to the proposed action. To conduct these activities, the Council may retain the initial committee, establish a standing committee or establish a committee to consider only specific proposed districts and then be dissolved. 
(e)  When considering the elimination of a Historic District, a committee shall follow the procedures and time limits set forth in this section for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing and issuing a final report, but with the intent of showing one or more of the following: 
(1)  The Historic District has lost those physical characteristics that qualified it for establishment as a District. 
(2)  The Historic District was not significant in the way in which it was previously defined. 
(3)  The Historic District was established pursuant to defective procedures. 
(f)  Upon the receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of the historic, architectural, archaeological, engineering or cultural significance of a proposed Historic District, Council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed Historic District be referred to the Commission as prescribed in Sections 1220.05, 1220.06 and 1220.07. The Commission shall review permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed Historic District was an established Historic District. The review may continue in the proposed Historic District for not more than one year, or until such time as Council approves or rejects the establishment of the Historic District by ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
(g)  If Council determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm to the resources located within an established Historic District or a proposed Historic District, Council may, by resolution, declare an emergency moratorium on all such work for a period not to exceed six months. Council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period, not to exceed six months, upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to the resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94; Ord. No. 01063,  1, 12-16-02) 
1220.04. - Establishment of Historic District Commission; membership; chairperson; meetings. 
(a)  The Historic District Commission is hereby established. The Commission shall consist of nine members whose residences are located within the City. They shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the consent of Council, for terms of office of three years. Members shall be reappointed at a rate of three per year, so that in any one year, no less than six unexpired terms of office shall continue. 
    At least two members shall be appointed from a list of residents submitted by a duly organized and existing preservation organization, and at least one member shall be an architect, duly registered in the State with a minimum of two years experience, if such a person resides within the City and is available for appointment. A majority of the members shall have a clearly demonstrated interest in or knowledge of historic preservation. Members of the Commission may be reappointed. A vacancy occurring in the membership of the Commission for any cause shall be filled, within 60 days, by a person appointed by the Mayor, with the consent of Council, for the unexpired term. All members of the Commission shall serve without compensation. 
(b)  The Chairperson shall be elected annually by a majority vote of the members of the Commission. The Commission may meet at such times as the Commission may determine or as otherwise required in this chapter. The Commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure and shall keep a record of its proceedings, showing the action of the Commission and the vote of each member upon each question considered. All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public and any person shall be entitled to address the Commission before it reaches a decision. The Commission shall keep a record which shall be open to the public. The presence of five members shall constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, any number less than a quorum may recess any meeting to a later time. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.05. - Powers and duties of Commission. 
(a)  The Historic District Commission shall review all permits required by City ordinance concerning construction, alteration, repair, moving or demolition of the exterior features of a District resource, or interior work only if said work will cause a visible change to the exterior of the resource, along with all accompanying plans and information as they pertain to the exterior features only. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed until the Commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of approval or a notice to proceed. 
(b)  An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Commission concerning a permit application may file an appeal with the State Historic Preservation Review Board of the Michigan Historical Commission within the Department of State. A permit applicant aggrieved by the decision of the State Historic Preservation Review Board may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction over the Historic District Commission whose decision was appealed to the State Historic Preservation Review Board. 
(c)  In reviewing permit applications and plans, the Commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings, as set forth in 36 CFR Part 67. The Commission shall also consider all of the following: 
(1)  The historical or architectural value and significance of a structure or building and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area; 
(2)  The relationship of the exterior architectural features of the structure or building to the rest of the structure or building and to the surrounding area; 
(3)  The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture and materials proposed to be used; and 
(4)  Any other factors, including aesthetic, which it deems pertinent. 
(d)  The Commission may propose to Council the establishment and/or elimination of any Historic District. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.06. - Procedure for review of permit applications; certificates of appropriateness and denial. 
(a)  Officials of the Planning And Neighborhood Development Department, in reviewing all applications for permits, shall ascertain whether or not District resources are located in designated Historic Districts and, if so, shall advise applicants of the requirements. An application for a permit required by City ordinance to construct, alter, repair, move or demolish any structure or to erect any sign within a Historic District shall be forwarded to the Historic District Commission by the Planning And Neighborhood Development Department, with all accompanying plans and information. The Commission shall publish the hearing notice in an official paper or a paper of general circulation in the City, and provide written notice to the applicant and surrounding property owners within 300 feet of any point on the boundaries of the land included in the proposed change, at least ten days prior to the public hearing. The applicant or his or her representative may be heard in person or in writing and may present evidence, witnesses and arguments, including an application for financial hardship as described in subsection (e). Any other person or his or her representative may be heard before the Commission on any matter relevant to the Commission's decision. 
(b)  Approval of applications for a permit required by City ordinance shall be evidenced by a certificate of appropriateness signed by the Chairperson of the Commission. 
(c)  If an application is for work the Commission finds will adversely affect the exterior of a resource and does not qualify for a notice to proceed under Section 1220.08, a certificate of denial will be issued. Disapproval will be evidenced by a written statement of findings of fact signed by the concurring members, which statement shall be attached to the application and returned to the Planning And Neighborhood Development Department with any suggestions as to how the plans might be modified for re-submission and approval. 
(d)  Any application not acted upon by the Commission within 60 days of receipt by the Commission shall constitute approval by the Commission, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Commission, and the Planning And Neighborhood Development Department official shall proceed to process the application without regard to an attached certificate of appropriateness. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the other subsections of this section, the Commission may issue a certificate of financial hardship under the following conditions: 
(1)  Application for financial hardship shall be made on a form prepared by the Commission and approved by the City Council and submitted in conjunction with an application for work. 
(2)  The Commission may require the applicant for a certificate of financial hardship to make submissions concerning any or all of the information set forth below before it makes a determination on the application. 
A.  Estimate from an architect, engineer, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional as to the cost of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the Commission for changes necessary for the issuance of a determination of appropriateness. 
B.  Estimated market value of the property in its current condition, after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal; after any changes recommended by the Commission; and in the case of a proposed demolition, after renovation of the existing resource for continued use. 
C.  In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, engineer, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of similar structures. 
D.  If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years; and depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period. 
E.  Remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years. 
F.  All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing, or ownership of the property; 
G.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any, within the previous two years; 
H.  Assessed value of the property according to the two most recent assessments; 
I.  Real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
J.  Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, or other; 
K.  Any other information the owner chooses to provide. 
(3)  In the event that any of the information is not reasonably available to the owner, cannot be obtained by the owner, and/or may not be disclosed without a substantial adverse impact upon the owner, the owner may file with the Commission a description of the information which cannot be obtained and describe the reasons why such information cannot be obtained and/or provided. 
(4)  The Commission shall review all the evidence and information required of an applicant for a certificate of financial hardship and make a determination whether the denial of a determination of appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. Failure of the Commission to act within 60 calendar days after the date a complete application is received, unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the Commission, shall be considered to constitute approval of the determination of appropriateness. 
(5)  Upon a finding by the Commission that without approval of the proposed work all reasonable use of, or return from, property within a historic district will be denied a property owner, the Commission shall investigate plans and make recommendations to the City Council to allow for a reasonable use of, return from, the property, or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include, but are not limited to: authorization for alterations, construction or reconstruction not in strict conformance with applicable preservation standards but consistent with the effectuation of the purposes of this ordinance; presentations to the property owner of available tax incentives and development and preservation options; to the extent possible under then-existing law, a reduction in real property taxes; financial assistance; building code modifications, and/or changes in zoning regulation. 
(6)  if the Commission has found that without approval of the proposed work, the property cannot be put to a reasonable use or the owner cannot obtain any reasonable economic return therefrom, then the Commission shall issue a certificate of financial hardship approving the proposed work and provide a copy of same to the Director of Planning and Neighborhood Development Department. If the Commission finds otherwise, it shall deny the applications for work and for a certificate of financial hardship and shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial and the applicant's right to appeal to the State Historic Preservation Review Board and Circuit Court and provide a copy of same to the Director of Planning And Neighborhood Development Department. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94; Ord. No. 01063,  1, 12-16-02) 
1220.07. - Removal or demolition of district resources. 
(a)  A certificate of approval or notice to proceed which will allow for the removal or demolition of a District resource shall be granted by the Historic District Commission if any of the following conditions prevail and if, in the opinion of the Commission, the proposed removal or demolition will materially improve or correct such conditions: 
(1)  The Department of Planning and Neighborhood Development Director or his or her designee determines the District resource to be a hazard to public safety or health or to its occupants; 
(2)  The District resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community, and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary approvals, permits, financing and environmental clearances required by law or regulation of the Federal, State or City government; 
(3)  Retention of the District resource would not be in the best interests of the majority of the community; or 
(4)  Retention of the structure would cause undue financial hardship to the owner when governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(b)  In the case of an application concerning a District resource which the Commission deems so valuable to the City, State or Nation that the loss thereof will adversely affect the public purpose of the City, State or Nation, the Commission shall endeavor to develop with the owner an economically feasible plan for preservation of the District resource. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.08. - Notice to proceed. 
(a)  Work within a Historic District shall be permitted through the issuance of a notice to proceed by the Commission if any of the following conditions exist and if the proposed work can be demonstrated, by a finding of the Commission, to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(1)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the structure's occupants. 
(2)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community, and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary approvals, permits, financing and environmental clearances required by law or regulation of the Federal, State or City government. 
(3)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the Historic District, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(4)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of persons in the community. 
(5)  A certificate of financial hardship has been issued under Section 1220.06. 
(b)  Any property owner or party ordering or effecting demolition, or continuing work after receiving written notice of cancellation, or proceeding in violation of either the scope or the nature of a notice to proceed, shall be subject to the penalty set forth in Section 1220.99. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94; Ord. No. 01063,  1, 12-16-02) 
1220.09. - Demolition by neglect. 
    Upon a finding by the Commission that a historic resource within a Historic District or a proposed Historic District subject to its review and approval is threatened with demolition by neglect: 
(a)  The Commission may require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing to demolition by neglect; or 
(b)  If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the Commission or its agents, if granted prior authorization by Council, may enter the property and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the City as a special assessment against the property. The Commission or its agents, upon approval by Council, may enter the property, for purposes of enforcing this section, upon obtaining an order from the Circuit Court. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.10. - Work without permit. 
    When work has been done upon a resource without a permit and the Commission finds that such work does not qualify for a certificate of approval, the Commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition it was in before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of approval. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission, upon approval of Council, may seek an order from the Circuit Court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of approval. If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the Court, the Commission or its agents, if granted prior authorization by Council, may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of approval in accordance with the Court's order. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the City as a special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to an order of the Circuit Court, the Commission or its agents may enter a property for purposes of enforcing this section. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.11. - Yard variances. 
    Due to particular conditions of design and construction in historic neighborhoods where structures are often built close to lot lines, and since it is in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic appearance by making variances to normal yard requirements where it is deemed that such variances will not adversely affect neighborhood properties, the Historic District Commission may recommend to the Board of Zoning Appeals that a variance from standard yard requirements be made. 
(Ord. No. 905, 12-12-94) 
1220.12. - Acceptance of grants and gifts; acquisition and disposal of district resources. 
(a)  The Historic District Commission may accept, on behalf of the City, grants from the State or Federal government for historic preservation purposes. It may also accept other public and private gifts for historic purposes. Title to any such property shall be vested in the City and all moneys shall be deposited with the City Treasurer and designated for Historic District Commission purposes.

(Ord. No. 156, 3-18-68) 
1234.02. - Sketch plans. 
    Since the preapplication stage is established to encourage subdividers to determine the procedures and requirements of various agencies concerned with platting prior to the expenditure of funds for plat preparation, only a minimum amount of information is needed. At a minimum, the sketch plan shall show existing conditions on and adjacent to the site, the general layout of streets, blocks and lots and any general areas set aside for schools, parks and other community facilities. 
(Ord. No. 156, 3-18-68)

(2)  Council, after receipt of the necessary approved copies of the preliminary plat and after a report from the Department of Planning and Municipal Development certifying that all conditions and requirements imposed upon the plat at the time of tentative approval have been complied with, shall, within 20 days of receipt of the necessary data, consider and review the preliminary plat. 
(f)  Length of Approval. The granting of preliminary approval by Council shall be for two years from the date of approval. Failure on the part of the subdivider to proceed under these Subdivision Regulations in accordance with final plat procedures within such two-year period shall result in automatic withdrawal of the preliminary approval. If any portion of a preliminary plat has been finally platted, the same shall constitute an automatic extension for two years. In order to reinstate the preliminary plat, the subdivider must again proceed through the preapplication and preliminary plat preparation and submittal stages, in accordance with these Subdivision Regulations. However, Council may make exception hereto and grant an extension.

(f)  Conditional rezoning. 
(1)  Intent.

It is the intent of this section to provide a process consistent with MCL  125.3405 by which a land owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request. 
(2)  Application and offer of conditions. 
(a)  A land owner or a land owner's agent may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This offer may be made either at the time the application for rezoning is filed or at a later time during the rezoning process. 
(b)  The required application and process for considering a rezoning request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the requirements of this section. 
(c)  The land owner's offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district. 
(d)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a special land use permit under the terms of this ordinance may only be commenced if a special land use permit for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(e)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a variance under the terms of this ordinance may only be commenced if a variance for such use or development is ultimately granted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(f)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require site plan approval under the terms of this ordinance may only be commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(g)  The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of rezoning consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are offered voluntarily by the owner. an owner may withdraw all or part of its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the City Council provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Board's public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be referred to the Planning Board for a new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation. 
(3)  Planning Board review. The Planning Board, after public hearing and consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in this ordinance, may recommend approval, approval with recommended changes or denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that any recommended changes to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the land owner. 
(4)  City Council review. after receipt of the Planning Board's recommendation, the City Council shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning request. The City Council's deliberations shall include, but not be limited to a consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in this ordinance. 
(5)  Approval. 
(a)  If City Council finds the rezoning request and offer of conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a formal written statement of conditions acceptable to the land owner and conforming in form to the provisions of this ordinance. The statement of conditions shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by City Council to accomplish the requested rezoning. 
(b)  The statement of conditions shall: 
(1)  Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains. 
(2)  Contain a statement acknowledging that the statement of conditions runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land. 
(3)  Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or other documents submitted or approved by the land owner that are necessary to illustrate the implementation of the statement of conditions. If any such documents are incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify where the document may be examined. 
(4)  Contain the notarized signatures of all of the land owners of the subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the statement of conditions. 
(c)  Upon the rezoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that the land was rezoned with a statement of conditions. The City Clerk shall maintain a listing of all lands rezoned with a statement of conditions. 
(d)  The City Council shall have authority to require that the statement of conditions be recorded with the register of deeds if it determines that, given the nature of the conditions, the recording of such a document would be of material benefit to the City or to any subsequent owner of the land. 
(e)  Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating its use and development as contained in the statement of conditions. 
(6)  Compliance with conditions. 
(a)  Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the statement of conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition contained within the statement of conditions shall constitute a violation of this zoning ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided by law.

(7)  Time period for establishing development or use. Unless another time period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the subject land, the approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required permits must be commenced upon the land within 18 months (or shorter if specified) after the rezoning takes effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time limitation may, upon written request, be extended by the City Council if: (1) It is demonstrated to the City Council's satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion and (2) the City Council finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that would render the zoning with statement of conditions incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise renders it inconsistent with zoning policy. 
(8)  Reversion of zoning. If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land does not occur within the time frame specified under Subsection (7) above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in MCL  125.3405. 
(9)  Subsequent rezoning of land. When land that is rezoned with a statement of conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning classification or to the same zoning classification but with a different or no statement of conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning or otherwise, the statement of conditions imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the land owner's written request, the City Clerk shall record with the register of deeds a notice that the statement of conditions is no longer in effect. 
(10)  Amendment of conditions when extension requested. If a conditional zoning has been approved and the applicant requests an extension of time for commencement of the development, the City Council may add to, delete or modify the conditions in the previously approved statement of conditions as part of its decision to grant the requested extension so long as the changes are proposed by the developer. 
(11)  City's right to rezone. Nothing in the statement of conditions nor in the provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the City from rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a statement of conditions to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with City Ordinances and City Charter. 
(12)  Failure to offer conditions. The City shall not require a land owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect a land owner's rights under this ordinance. 
(g)  After the public hearing described in subsection (d) hereof, the Board shall make its final report to Council. A summary of the comments submitted at the public hearing shall be transmitted with the report of the Board to Council. Council shall hold at least one public hearing and shall provide notice of a public hearing as described in subsection (e) hereof. 
(h)  Council shall not determine the boundaries of districts nor impose regulations until after the final report of the Board, nor shall this Zoning Code or the maps be amended after they are adopted in the first instance until the proposed amendment has been submitted to the Board and it has held at least one hearing and made a report. In either case, Council may adopt the ordinance and maps, with or without amendments, after receipt of the Board's report, or refer this Zoning Code and maps again to the Board for a further report. 
(i)  Upon presentation of a protest petition meeting the requirements of this subsection, an amendment to this Zoning Code which is the object of the petition shall be passed only by a two-thirds vote of Council. The protest petition shall be presented to Council before final legislative action on the amendment, and shall be signed by one of the following: 
(1)  The owners of at least 20 percent of the area of land included in the proposed change; or

(b)  The Board may grant variances for the following: 
(1)  Modification of the dimensional requirements as may be necessary to secure appropriate improvement of a lot, which lot is of such shape or so located with relation to surrounding development or physical characteristics that it cannot otherwise be appropriately improved without such modification; and 
(2)  Modification of zoning requirements for additions or enlargements to existing structures, provided that all requirements for the particular use in the zoning district where such use is first permitted cannot be met without physical hardship pertaining to the shape of the lot and adjacent land uses or topography. 
(c)  When considering a variance described in subsection (b) hereof, the Board shall consider the following criteria in determining if a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship exists: 
(1)  If the owner of the lot complies with this Zoning Code, he or she can secure no reasonable return from, or make no reasonable use of, his or her property.

(d)  The procedure for obtaining a variance in accordance with this section shall be the same as that outlined in Section 1244.04. 
(e)  In considering a proposed variance from this Zoning Code, the Board shall first, in each specific case, determine that practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships exist, according to the following standards: 
(1)  The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(2)  The proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved, taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access of off-street parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to minimizing child-vehicle contacts in residential districts. 
(3)  The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate a possible nuisance emanating therefrom, which nuisance might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby permitted use, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights. 
(4)  The location and height of structures and joint driveways and the location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and structures or unreasonably affect their value. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1244.07. - Vote required. 
    The concurring vote of a majority of the members serving on the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of the Planning Division or to decide in favor of the applicant a matter upon which it is required to pass under an ordinance, or to effect a variance of such ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1244.08. - Conditions for approval. 
    The Board of Zoning Appeals, in acting favorably in connection with an appeal or variance, may attach any condition to its approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the standards described in Section 1244.06(e). 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1244.09. - Appeals to Circuit Court. 
(a)  The decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final. However, a person having an interest affected by this Zoning Code may appeal to the Circuit Court. Upon appeal, the Court shall review the record and decision of the Board to ensure that the decision: 
(1)  Complies with the Constitution and laws of the State; 
(2)  Is based upon proper procedure; 
(3)  Is supported by competent material and substantial evidence on the record; and 
(4)  Represents the reasonable exercise of discretion granted by law to the Board. 
(b)  If the Court finds that the record of the Board is inadequate to make the review required by this section, or that there is additional evidence which is material and with good reason was not presented to the Board, the Court shall order further proceedings before the Board on conditions which the Court considers proper. The Board may modify its findings and decision as a result of the new proceedings, or may affirm its original decision. The supplementary record and decisions shall be filed with the Court. 
(c)  As a result of the review required by this section, the Court may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the Board.

1288.01. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of floodplain control to apply special regulations to the use of land in those areas of the City which are subject to predictable inundations at frequent intervals. 
    Such regulations, while permitting reasonable economic use of such properties, will help protect the public health and reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its individuals by frequent and period floods and the overflow of lands; reserve such areas for the impoundment of water to better stabilize stream flow; and better maintain the proper ecological balance. All lands included in the floodplain control district shall be subject to the terms imposed in this chapter, in addition to the terms imposed by any other zoning use district in which such lands should be located, and to the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program, as adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.02. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    Accessory building or appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the main building, the use of which is incidental to the use of the main building. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 509, passed August 7, 1978). 
    Federal Insurance Administrator means the administrator to whom the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated the administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source; and 
(3)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map means an official map of the City on which the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the City. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane and tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. Such specialized flood-modifying works are constructed in conformity with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain means the area of land adjoining the channel of a river, stream, watercourse, lake or other similar body of water, which area of land will be inundated by a base flood, as determined by studies of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Water Resources Commission, until such time as a Flood Insurance Rate Map is issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation above a height designated by the State Department of Natural Resources. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter (Ordinance 509, passed August 7, 1978). 
    One hundred year flood. See "Base flood." 
    Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; the installation of streets and/or walkways; excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; or the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, "start of construction" means the affixing of a mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, "start of construction" is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads and the installation of utilities) is completed. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed, building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a mobile home. 
    Studies of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Michigan Water Resources Commission means the publication: Flood Plain Information Grand River, Red Cedar River and Sycamore Creek, Lansing, Michigan, and Vicinity, prepared for the Water Resources Commission, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission, by the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, Detroit District, April, 1970. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not such alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. However, the term does not include either a project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or an alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Sites. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the City from the terms of a floodplain control regulation. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.03. - Floodplain boundaries. 
    All land lying within the floodplain of the base flood of the Grand and Red Cedar Rivers and Sycamore Creek is within the floodplain and subject to these regulations, in addition to the regulations otherwise established by this Zoning Code. The boundaries of the floodplain are hereby established as determined by studies of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Water Resources Commission, until such time as a Flood Insurance Rate Map is issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, which studies and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map, with all notations, references and other information shown thereon, shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully described herein. The petitioner for use of the floodplain shall supply such additional topographical data or engineer studies as are needed to define the exact limits of the floodplain upon the subject land. 
    Where there is a question as to the exact boundaries and limits of a flood control district, the City Engineer shall determine the limits from topographical data available to and submitted to him or her. Such information may be reviewed by the Department of Natural Resources.

(b)  Where topographical data, engineering studies or other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a structure and/or the effects of the structure on the flow of water, the applicant shall submit such data or studies. All such data shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. 
(c)  No construction shall be allowed without approval by the Department of Natural Resources and a special permit therefor from the City. 
(d)  Dumping or backfilling with any material or excavation in any manner is prohibited, unless: 
(1)  Through compensating excavation and shaping of the floodplain, the flow and impounding capacity of the floodplain will be maintained or improved, will not cause an increase in the flood hazard or damage from floods and will not allow water to collect in pools that will stagnate. 
(2)  No significantly measurable reduction in the flow or impoundment capacity of the floodplain thereby results. 
(3)  Where there is dumping, backfilling or excavation in any manner, adequate site plans and engineering drawings shall be submitted to effectively show the final results of such action. 
(4)  Alteration of any floodplain area shall be based upon a plan approved by the Department of Natural Resources. 
(e)  In a floodplain, the construction or location of bridges, outdoor play equipment, bleachers and similar outdoor equipment and appurtenances and the storage of materials or equipment is prohibited, unless such elements would not cause any significant obstruction to the flood or reduction in the impoundment capacity of the floodplain and would not suffer flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.06. - Application procedure for special permits. 
(a)  Requests for special permits for use of the floodplain for parcels of more than a half acre shall be made in writing, with the data required by Section 1288.05(c) and (d)(3) and three copies filed with the City Clerk. Council shall refer such requests to the Planning Board for recommendation, to the Public Service Department for its technical report and to the City Engineer for his or her recommendations before taking action. 
(b)  For parcels of a half acre or less, requests for special permits for use of the floodplain shall be made in writing, with the data required by Section 1288.05(c) and (d)(3), and evidence of approval by the State Department of Natural Resources, and filed with the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall review the request for compliance with this chapter and shall refer the request to the City Engineer for a review of the engineering data and to the Director of Building Safety for a review of the floodproofing measures. A special permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator upon receiving written approval from the City Engineer, the Director of Building Safety and the State Department of Natural Resources, and upon making a determination that all requirements of this Zoning Code have been met. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.07. - Nonconforming uses. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to control development in the floodplain. 
    It is recognized that there exists within the floodplain, lots and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, which lots and structures would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under terms of this chapter or future amendments. 
    Such uses are declared by this chapter to be nonconforming uses. It is further the intent of this chapter that uses which are not lawful shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited in the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.08. - Nonliability of city. 
    The City shall incur no liability whatsoever by permitting any use or building within the flood control district. 
(Ord. No. 509, 8-7-78) 
1288.09. - Enforcement; conflict of laws. 
    Except where otherwise stated in this chapter, the Department of Planning and Municipal Development shall enforce this chapter.

The procedures for granting variances are as follows: 
(a)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  The Department of Planning and Municipal Development shall notify the applicant, in writing, that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risk to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.

1290.01. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    Adjacent means contiguous to, abutting or directly across a public street or alley from the subject property. However, if a public right-of-way is 100 feet in width or greater, or the right-of-way is the Grand River, then such property across the right-of-way shall not be considered adjacent. 
    Berm means an earthen mound containing plant materials or fencing designed to separate one area from another in an aesthetically pleasing manner. 
    Buffer means a physical area that separates one land use from another. Such area could be landscaped with plants and could also contain a berm, fence or other screening material. 
    Contiguous means having a common border; adjacent. 
    Fence means any wall (except a retaining wall), screen, partition or similar structure existing on a yard or parcel of land, which structure encloses land, divides land into distinct portions, separates contiguous properties, obstructs the passage of light or air into adjacent land or obstructs the vision of motorists on or near public roads. Barbed wire shall not be considered part of a fence for purposes of determining the height thereof. 
    Intensity of land use means the amount of activity associated with a specific land use. Intensity of land use shall be determined by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development based on the following criteria: 
(1)  Amount of vehicular traffic generated; 
(2)  Amount of pedestrian traffic generated; 
(3)  Noise, odor and air pollution generated; 
(4)  Potential for litter; 
(5)  Type and storage of materials connected with the operation; 
(6)  Total residential units and density, where applicable; and 
(7)  Total building coverage on the parcel. 
    However, intensity of land use shall not be considered except when a building permit is required. 
    Landscaping means an arrangement of elements, such as plants, paving materials, earth, land areas and fencing or screening, on the exterior edges of property for aesthetic and functional purposes. 
    Nonresidential use means any use not a residential use. 
    Residential use means any land use which is primarily utilized by a person for living quarters. "Residential use" includes, but is not limited to, single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, dormitories, rooming houses or foster care facilities. 
    Screen means fence, landscaping, berm or combination thereof that obscures the view from one site to another to a reasonable extent. 
    Use means the carrying on of activities in a building or on a parcel of land. "Use" includes, but is not limited to, a business, office, industry, residence or parking or storage area. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.02. - Purpose. 
    The purposes of this chapter are to: 
(a)  Provide a better living environment by visually enhancing the physical impact of buildings and their parking areas and reduce negative impacts on adjacent land uses through the use of various buffering, landscaping and fencing techniques; and 
(b)  Ensure that physical barriers are established between residential uses, nonresidential uses or any combination thereof. The function of such barriers is to: 
(1)  Protect property values of both residential and nonresidential land uses; 
(2)  Minimize apparent or potential conflicts between residential and nonresidential land uses; and 
(3)  Create a better living and business environment through the maintenance of privacy by the provision of adequate landscape, screening and buffering treatment between the adjacent land uses. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.03. - Responsibilities of owners; plans required. 
(a)  Rezoning Requests. Where a rezoning request is approved and a landscape, screening and buffering plan is required under this section, the owner of the rezoned parcel will be required to submit a landscape, screening and buffering plan for the rezoned parcel prior to the issuance of a building permit or prior to the use of such land. 
(b)  Nonresidential Uses Next to Existing Residential Uses. Landscaping, screening and buffering shall be provided at the sole expense of the owner of a nonresidential property when a nonresidential use is established adjacent or contiguous to an already existing residential use and a building permit is required. However, if an industrial use that is zoned H Light Industrial District or I Heavy Industrial District is established next to a residential use, landscaping, screening and buffering shall not be required. 
(c)  Nonowner-Occupied Residential Uses Next to Existing Nonresidential Uses. Landscaping, screening and buffering shall be provided at the sole expense of the developer or owner of a residential property when a nonowner-occupied residential use is established abutting an existing nonresidential use and a building permit is required. 
(d)  Expansion of Nonresidential Uses Adjacent to Residential Uses. If the owner of an existing nonresidential use that is adjacent to an existing residential use desires to expand or to increase the intensity of such nonresidential use, and where a building permit is required, a condition for issuance of the building permit shall be the provision of a landscape, screening and buffering plan between the nonresidential use and the existing residential use. 
(e)  Expansion of Nonowner-Occupied Residential Uses Adjacent to Nonresidential Uses. If the owner of a nonowner-occupied residential use adjacent to an already existing nonresidential use desires to expand or to increase the intensity of the use, a condition for the issuance of a building permit shall be the provision of a landscape, screening and buffering plan. 
(f)  Establishment or Expansion of Public or Private Land Uses. If a public or private land use locates or expands in an area, creating a more intense relationship with adjacent land uses, a landscape, screening and buffering plan shall be required and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the public or private land use that is locating or expanding in the area. However, this subsection shall not apply to industrially zoned property (H and I Districts) which is surrounded by other industrially zoned property. Due to the special nature of public parks and public schools, this subsection shall only apply to the parking and service areas of such uses. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.04. - Review of plans. 
    When required by Section 1290.03, a landscape, screening and buffering plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development prior to the use of the land or the issuance of a building permit. The Department shall have a maximum of 14 days to review the plan and approve the building permit. In a case where revisions must be made to the submitted plan, the Department, after conferring with the applicant, shall expeditiously work out an acceptable schedule to resolve the identified concerns before the building permit is issued. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.05. - Waivers. 
(a)  If the Department of Planning and Municipal Development, upon inspection, determines that suitable landscaping, screening and buffering on a site already exists or that such landscaping, screening and buffering should not be required, then the provisions requiring landscaping, screening and buffering may be waived in whole or in part. However, such waiver shall not apply to the maintenance portion of this chapter. 
(b)  In all cases if, in the opinion of the Department, the weather makes it impossible or impractical to implement or maintain the landscape, screening and buffering plan within the time schedule stipulated, it shall be considered just cause for the granting of a written waiver from the Department upon the verbal or written request of the applicant or upon the initiative of the Department. The written weather waiver shall stipulate a new time schedule for implementation of such plan. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.06. - Contents of plans. 
    Landscape, screening and buffering plans shall be prepared in the following manner: 
(a)  A legend and title block, specifying the scale used, identifying north, specifying the name and address of the site, indicating the date drawn, specifying the name and address of the property owner and the person who prepared the plan, shall be shown. It is suggested that the scale of the plan should be one inch equals 20 feet. If the site is larger than 20 acres, the suggested scale should be one inch equals 50 feet. 
(b)  Accurate locations and dimensions of all buildings, lot lines, easements and right-of-ways on the subject lot and adjacent residential or nonresidential lots shall be shown. 
(c)  Accurate locations and dimensions of all driveways, maneuvering aisles, parking spaces and loading facilities on the subject lot shall be shown. 
(d)  Accurate locations and dimensions shall be given for any nonplant landscaping, screening and/or buffering material to be utilized. 
(e)  Accurate locations and planting size of each plant to be utilized, including common and/or Latin names of such plants, shall be given on the plan. 
(f)  Four copies of the plan shall be submitted. 
(g)  Topographic contours may be required to be given at two-foot intervals if a drainage problem is anticipated. 
(h)  The location and type of all lighting materials shall be shown on the plan. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.07. - Time schedule for implementation. 
    A landscape, screening and buffering plan shall be implemented not later than 90 days after the issuance of an occupancy permit. An inspector from the Department of Planning and Municipal Development shall inspect the subject property at the end of the 90-day period and determine if the approved landscape, screening and buffering plan has been properly implemented. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.08. - Design regulations. 
    Landscape, screening and buffering plans shall be governed by the following regulations: 
(a)  Fencing. 
(1)  Obstructing motorist and pedestrian vision. No fence shall be erected or maintained which materially obstructs the vision of motorists or pedestrians on adjacent streets or entering into adjacent streets. Fences subject to this chapter may be erected at any mechanically or electronically controlled intersection only with the written approval of both the Department of Planning and Municipal Development and the Department of Public Service. 
(2)  Height limits. No fence shall be constructed under this subsection, which fence is less than five feet nor more than ten feet in height, except as specified in this subsection, as follows: 
A.  Corner lots. No fence shall be erected or maintained at any height above three feet within the triangular area bounded by the property lines of the corner lot nearest the intersection of the adjacent streets and a line joining points on the property lines 25 feet from the point of intersection of the property lines. (See Sketch 1, Appendix IV, following the text of this Zoning Code.) The height limit for this subsection shall be measured from the lowest centerline elevation within 50 feet of the intersection of the centerline of the street. (See Sketch 2, Appendix IV, following the text of this Zoning Code.) This height requirement can be waived in part or in whole at any mechanically or electronically controlled intersection only upon the written approval of both the Department of Planning and Municipal Development and the Department of Public Service. Any decision to waive such requirement by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development and the Department of Public Service shall be based on safety and reasonableness. 
B.  Driveways. No fence shall be erected or maintained at any height above three feet within either of the triangular areas bounded by the property line closest to and running parallel to the streets, and a straight line joining a point on the property line ten feet from the driveway side line and a point on the driveway side line six feet from the edge of a sidewalk which parallels the street, if any, or 15 feet from the curb line, whichever is a greater distance from the street. (See Sketch 3, Appendix IV, following the text of this Zoning Code.) 
C.  Exceptions. Any fence within any of the triangular areas established herein may be erected or maintained at a height above three feet only if the fence meets the following requirements: 
1.  The fence within the triangular area consists of at least 75 percent open space uniformly distributed along its surface above a height of three feet. 
2.  Vision through the fence is not obstructed from any angle so as to obstruct the view of traffic on adjacent roads, or that of pedestrian traffic on adjacent sidewalks. 
(3)  Materials. 
A.  Fences constructed under this chapter shall be constructed of one or more of the following materials: Chain link, wood, brick, poured concrete or any other material that is approved by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development. 
B.  For all fences under eight feet in height and for all fences, regardless of height, which are less than 30 feet from a neighboring parcel of land which is being used residentially, barbed wire on fences may be utilized only upon the written request of the applicant and written approval by the Department. Approval of such request shall be based on demonstrated need, safety and reasonableness. For all fences eight feet in height and 30 feet or more away from a neighboring parcel of land which is being used residentially, barbed wire on fences shall be allowed without prior approval of the Department. Under no circumstances will any fence six feet in height or less be permitted to use barbed wire. Barbed wire shall not extend more than three vertical feet above the top of the fence. 
(b)  Berms. If earth berms are to be constructed, they shall have a maximum slope of 3:1 and shall be sodded or seeded or utilize other ground cover. Berm height, width, location and materials must be approved by the Department. 
(c)  Landscaping Materials Utilized for Screening Purposes. 
(1)  Plants shall be planted on the site in such a manner that the potential adverse impact of the specified use is minimized. 
(2)  All plants shall be approved by the Department as to their type, size at original planting and final size, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(3)  When a use is established under Section 1290.03, the required landscape, screening and buffering plan shall include provisions for the landscaping and screening of off-street parking areas. The intent of the landscaping and screening of off-street parking areas is to screen such areas from adjacent residential uses, except when a residential use is zoned industrial, and to partially screen the off-street parking from any public right-of-way. 
(4)  Nonplant landscaping materials may be utilized in conjunction with plants to create positive impacts. However, any use of nonplant landscape materials shall be first approved by the Department. 
(d)  Buffering. As a general rule, buffering shall be a minimum width of eight feet from all lot lines adjacent to the public right-of-way, excluding approved driveways, and any residentially zoned property, but in no case shall it be required to exceed 20 feet in width. The determination of the actual width of the buffering necessary at a specific site shall be made by the Department. In no case shall such buffering preclude the reasonable use of any property. If a developer is not in agreement with the decision of the Department concerning buffering, he or she may request an appeal from the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(e)  Screening of Trash Receptacles. Trash receptacles may be required to be screened from view by a fence, landscaping materials or some other method approved by the Department. However, this provision shall apply only if a building permit is required for the development of the property. 
(f)  Minimum Standards for Buffering. All required buffer areas shall contain at least five shrubs for each 20 linear feet, or fraction of buffer area. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 24 inches height and spread at the time of planting. If a screen wall or fence is used for all or part of the buffer area, a minimum of one shrub for each ten linear feet or fraction of wall or fence shall be placed on the exterior side of the wall or fence. The placement of shrubs in informal groupings is permitted. In addition, at least one tree for each 30 linear feet, or fraction of buffer area shall be provided. Trees shall be a minimum of two caliper inches at the time of planting.

No owner, occupant, agent in charge or developer shall keep or maintain any landscaping, screening and buffering in any manner which is unsafe or dangerous or which is not maintained as provided in this section. 
(a)  Fencing. Fencing shall be considered unsafe or dangerous or not maintained: 
(1)  Whenever more than 33 percent of the area of a painted fence is in need of paint or 33 percent of any fence is in need of nonstructural repair; 
(2)  Whenever any portion of the fence area has been damaged by wind, flood, fire or other cause in such a manner that structural strength or stability is appreciably less than it was previous to such event; 
(3)  Whenever any portion or structural member of the fence is likely to fall or to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure persons or damage property; or 
(4)  Whenever more than ten percent of the fence area is in need of structural repair. 
(b)  Landscaping. The landscaping shown on the approved landscape, screening and buffering plan shall be maintained in the following manner: 
(1)  Any plants in the approved plan that die shall be replaced within a reasonable time, but in no case shall such time exceed four months. The replacement plants shall meet the purpose of the original specifications of an approved landscape, screening and buffering plan. 
(2)  Plants shall be kept pruned and maintained so as to promote proper growth and development. 
(3)  Weeds shall be kept under control. 
(c)  Buffer Strips. Buffer strips shall be properly maintained according to the types of materials utilized. Cover materials shall be maintained in a manner as specified at the time of the plan's approval. 
No buildings or parking or storage of materials or vehicles shall be allowed in any designated buffer strips, unless approved by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.10. - Improper maintenance; remedies. 
    Upon determining that a landscaping, screening or buffering area is a health or safety hazard, is improperly maintained or has not been installed as required, the Department of Planning and Municipal Development shall proceed in the following manner: 
(a)  The Department shall notify the property owner, in writing, of the problem by certified mail, return receipt requested, or, if possible, by delivering it in person. The property owner shall be given 14 days to correct the identified problem. 
(b)  If the problem still exists after 14 days, the Department shall post the property as being in violation of this chapter. A certified letter, return receipt requested, shall also be sent to the property owner notifying the owner of the problem and of the actions necessary to correct the hazard and what the City will do if it is not corrected by a certain date. The owner shall be given 30 days from receipt of the letter either to correct the identified problems or to submit a time schedule for approval by the Department. 
(c)  The Department shall reinspect the property after 30 days or at the end of an approved time schedule. If the identified problem still exists, the Department shall have the landscaping, screening or buffering repaired, restored or installed as appropriate, with the costs, including administrative costs as stipulated by Council resolution, of such repair or removal, being attached to the tax rolls for the property. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.11. - Appeals. 
    Any appeal from a ruling by the Department of Planning and Municipal Development or a request for a variance based on hardship or practical difficulties shall be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(Ord. No. 809, 12-11-89) 
1290.12. - Expiration date. 
    This chapter shall expire and be null and void ten years after the date of adoption (Ordinance 809, passed December 11, 1989), unless, two months before its time of expiration, Council acts to re-enact this chapter.

(1)  Regulate a use, structure or lot, or any combination of use, structure or lot, which does not conform to the terms and conditions provided in this chapter; and 
(2)  Provide flexibility when regulating a nonconformity so as to permit resumption, restoration, reconstruction, extension or substitution of certain types of nonconformities. 
(Ord. No. 827, 12-17-90) 
1294.02. - Groups of nonconformities. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, each nonconformity shall be placed into one of the following groups: 
(a)  "Group 1 nonconformity" means a use of a lot with no structure, including, but not limited to, mineral extraction, or a use of a lot with minor structures, with a total value of $5,000.00 or less, which lot does not conform to the use or dimensional provisions, or any combination of the use or dimensional provisions, of this Zoning Code. "Minor structure" means a structure having a replacement cost of not more than $5,000.00. 
(b)  "Group 2 nonconformity" means a structure, other than a building, including, but not limited to, a sign, billboard or fence, which structure does not conform to the use or dimensional provisions of this Zoning Code. 
(c)  "Group 3 nonconformity" means a structure which does not and cannot conform to the use or dimensional provisions, or any combination of the use or dimensional provisions, of this Zoning Code. A Group 3 nonconformity also includes a lot with a building on it, which building does not and cannot conform to the use or dimensional provisions of this Zoning Code, or any combination of the use or dimensional provisions of this Zoning Code. 
(d)  "Group 4 nonconformity" means a structure or a lot with a building which does not conform, but may be reasonably made to conform, to the use or dimensional provisions, or any combination of the use or dimensional provisions, of this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. No. 827, 12-17-90) 
1294.03. - Classes of nonconformities. 
(a)  Group 1 to Group 4 nonconformities shall be classified as either Class A or Class B. Class A nonconformities are those nonconformities which have been designated as Class A nonconformities by the Planning Board, pursuant to the criteria described in Section 1294.04 and the procedures described in Section 1294.05. 
(b)  All nonconformities which have not been designated as Class A by the Board, pursuant to the criteria described in Section 1294.04 and the procedures described in Section 1294.05, shall be Class B nonconformities. Class A nonconformities shall have greater flexibility than Class B nonconformities, in terms of permitting the resumption, restoration, reconstruction, extension or substitution of a nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1294.04. - Criteria for class A status. 
(a)  The Planning Board shall, based upon the criteria described in this section, approve, approve with conditions or disapprove a request for Class A status. 
(b)  A nonconformity which is placed in Group 1 shall not be granted Class A status. 
(c)  A nonconformity which is placed in Group 2 shall not be granted Class A status. 
(d)  A nonconformity which is placed in Group 3 may be granted Class A status if the public health, welfare and safety would be served by approving Class A status, except if the following exists: 
(1)  The request involves a nonresidential use located on a local street and the Transportation Engineer reports a negative impact. 
(2)  The activities associated with the nonconformity generate smoke, odor, air pollution, water pollution, vibration, glare or noise which is more than the level associated with the uses permitted by right in the district in which the nonconformity is located. The Planning Division may require the applicant to provide reliable technical evidence for the purpose of determining the amount of smoke, odor, air pollution, water pollution, vibration, glare or noise which exists on the lot for which Class A status is being sought. 
(3)  The nonconformity does not meet one or more of the parking requirements designated in Chapter 1284. However, if an applicant provides reliable data to the Planning Division which indicates that peak hour parking demand for the use shall not exceed the number of parking spaces available during the highest intensity of use, then Class A status may be granted. The highest intensity of use shall be determined by the Division. 
(e)  A nonconformity which is placed in Group 4 shall not be granted Class A status, except if the only provision of this Zoning Code with which the Group 4 nonconformity fails to conform is one or more of the parking requirements designated in Chapter 1284. In this case, if the applicant provides reliable data to the Planning Division, which data indicate that peak hour parking demand for the nonconformity will not exceed the number of parking spaces which exist, then as long as all other parking requirements of Chapter 1284 are met, Class A status may be granted. The highest intensity of use shall be determined by the Division.

1294.06. - Class A nonconformity regulations. 
(a)  A Class A nonconformity may be restored, reconstructed, extended or substituted as provided in this chapter. These actions must, in the opinion of the Planning Division, be within the original intent of the first granted Class A. In addition, the intensity of use must not exceed that of the previously approved Class A. A Class A nonconformity may be resumed as provided for in Section 1294.11. 
(b)  A Class A nonconformity damaged by fire, explosion, flood, erosion or any other catastrophe may be restored or reconstructed if the cost of restoration or reconstruction is not more than 50 percent of the nonconformity's precatastrophe fair market value of the building, except that this 50 percent limitation on restoration and reconstruction shall not apply for 15 years from the date credits are issued for a building that receives Federal IRS low income housing tax credits and which has been granted a payment in lieu of taxes under Chapters 884 and 886 of these codified ordinances. When the 50 percent limitation applies and damage is greater than 50 percent, the restoration or reconstruction may be permitted only by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(c)  In the case of a substitution of a Class A nonconformity, Planning Board approval, pursuant to the procedure outlined in Section 1294.05, is required. Planning Board approval may be granted at the discretion of the Board, if the Board determines that the new use is placed within the same group of non-conformities as the former use, as determined under Section 1294.03. In addition, the Board shall determine that the new use is not more intense than the former use. 
(Ord. No. 827, 12-17-90; Ord. No. 1051,  1, 9-16-02) 
1294.07. - Class B nonconformity regulations. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, a Class B nonconformity shall not be restored, reconstructed, extended, substituted or resumed. 
(b)  The Planning Board may permit the substitution or restoration of a Class B nonconformity, so long as the cost of substitution or restoration is not more than 35 percent of the fair market value of the Class B nonconformity and the effect of the substitution or restoration is not to increase the intensity of the use or the exterior physical dimension of the structure. In no such case shall the cumulative and total substitution or restoration be more than 35 percent of the fair market value of the Class B nonconformity. Fair market value shall be calculated on the date a building permit is requested to perform the substitution or restoration. 
(c)  A Class B nonconformity damaged by fire, explosion, flood, erosion or any other catastrophe may be restored, if the cost of restoration is less than 50 percent of the pre-catastrophe fair market value. A structure damaged more than 50 percent shall not be restored, except in conformity with the provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(d)  If a Class B nonconformity is damaged by fire, explosion, flood, erosion or any other catastrophe, and if, prior to the damage, the nonconformity would have been placed as a Group 3 or Group 4 nonconformity, then a request for Class A status may be filed with the Planning Division, pursuant to the procedures described in Section 1294.05, not more than 365 days after the date of the damage. 
(e)  In the substitution of use of a Class B nonconformity, Planning Board approval, pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 1294.05, is required. Planning Board approval may be granted if the Board determines that the new use is within the same group of nonconformities as the former use. In addition, the Board shall determine that the new use is not more intense than the former use. 
(f)  A Class B nonconformity may be resumed pursuant to Section 1294.11(b). 
(Ord. No. 827, 12-17-90) 
1294.08. - Fair market value; resumption costs. 
(a)  The fair market value of a nonconformity shall be determined under this chapter on the basis of an appraisal by a licensed real estate broker, experienced and qualified in the appraisal of real estate. Qualifications shall be demonstrated by a person's designation by one of the nationally recognized appraisal organizations, including, but not limited to, the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, the Society of Real Estate Appraisers or the American Society of Appraisers. 
(b)  The cost of resumption, restoration, reconstruction, extension or substitution shall be determined based upon estimates of a licensed contractor or from any other evidence satisfactory to the Planning Division. 
    The estimate of the cost of resumption, restoration, reconstruction, extension or substitution shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The cost of all materials utilized; 
(2)  The cost of all cleanup and painting; 
(3)  The cost of labor; and 
(4)  Profit and overhead. 
(Ord. No. 735, 11-24-86) 
1294.09. - Revocation of class a designation. 
(a)  The Planning Division may review a nonconformity which maintains Class A status. If the Division, upon review, determines that a nonconformity no longer meets the requirements of Section 1294.04, then the Division shall send a certified letter, return receipt requested, to all persons to whom the lot is assessed, according to the records maintained in the office of the City Assessor, stating that the Division has determined that the nonconformity no longer meets the requirements of Section 1294.04 and the reasons therefor. The certified letter shall give the owner 30 days to rectify the problem or to request a public hearing from the Planning Board. 
    If the problem has not been rectified after 30 days, or the owner has not, within such period, requested a public hearing, then the Class A status shall be revoked by the Board. 
(b)  Upon receiving a request for a public hearing pursuant to this section, the Board shall hold a public hearing to determine whether or not Class A status should be revoked. The public hearing shall be held pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 1294.05. 
(c)  If the Board determines that the criteria of Section 1294.04 are not being met, it shall revoke a Class A status by adopting a resolution revoking Class A status, which resolution states the reasons why the Class A status is revoked. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1294.10. - Nonconformities under construction. 
    A structure which does not meet a provision of this Zoning Code is a nonconformity if the start of construction has begun prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1294.11. - Abandonment of use. 
(a)  A Group 1 nonconformity which is abandoned for six consecutive months shall lose its nonconformity status and shall then only be used in a manner which meets the provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  A Group 2 through Group 4 nonconformity which is abandoned for 12 consecutive months shall lose its nonconformity status and shall then only be used in a manner which meets all the provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(c)  Failure to continue to use any lot or structure, which lot or structure is a nonconformity under this chapter, if the failure continues for 365 days, shall be conclusive proof of an intention to legally abandon the nonconformity. 
(d)  If a nonconformity is in probate or foreclosure, and during the period of probate or foreclosure the use is abandoned, such period of abandonment shall not be used to calculate the time described in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, up to a maximum of three years. 
(Ord. No. 636, 3-7-83) 
1294.12. - Appeals.

CHAPTER 1298. - [WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS] 

1298.01. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance [chapter] is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this ordinance [chapter] are to: (1) protect residential areas, property values, and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; (2) strongly encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; (3) minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; strongly encourage the appropriate placement of new and existing towers (4) strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; (5) strongly encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; (6) strongly encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes displeasing aesthetics of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; (7) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (8) consider, to the extent permitted by law, the public health and safety impacts of communication towers; and (9) avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering, design, and careful siting of tower structures. in furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to the city's comprehensive plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas. 
(Ord. No. 1138,  1, 11-10-08) 
1298.02. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth below:

Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right. 
(Ord. No. 1138,  1, 11-10-08) 
1298.04. - General requirements. 
(a)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. 
(b)  Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas and/or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot. 
(c)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the zoning administrator an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the City or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. Information submitted to the zoning administrator shall be considered public information. The zoning administrator may share such information with the public and other applicants applying for special land use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City, provided, however that the zoning administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(d)  Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Except as otherwise required for an alternative tower structure, towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(e)  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting may be provided on an alternative tower structure to enhance its camouflaging or concealing effect. All lighting must be approved by the City. 
(f)  State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency.

(iii)  The antenna complies with all applicable building codes. 
(b)  Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be approved by the zoning administrator and, to minimize the displeasing aesthetics associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following: 
(i)  A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the zoning administrator allows reconstruction as a monopole. 
(ii)  Height: 
(a)  An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna. 
(b)  The height change referred to in subsection 1298.06(b)(5)(ii)(a) may only occur one time per communication tower. 
(c)  The additional height referred to in subsection 1298.06(b)(5)(ii)(a) shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in Section 1298.07. The tower's premodification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
(iii)  Onsite location. 
(a)  A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within 50 feet of its existing location. 
(b)  After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the site. 
(c)  A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between towers pursuant to subsection 1298.07(b)(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of subsection 1298.07(b)(5). 
(d)  The onsite relocation of a tower which comes withinto a location that is less than the separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as established in subsection 1298.07(b)(5) shall only be permitted when approved by the zoning administrator.

(v)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
(vi)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
(vii)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(4)  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers for which a special land use permit is required; provided, however, that the Council may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
(i)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75 percent of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line. 
(ii)  Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
(5)  Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special land use permit is required; provided, however, that the Council may reduce the standard separation requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
(i)  Separation from off-site uses/designated areas. 
(a)  Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1. 
(b)  Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the minimum standards established in Table 1. 
Table 1: 
Off-Site Use/Designated Area Separation Distance Single-family or duplex residential units 1 100 feet or 150 percent height of tower whichever is greater Vacant single-family or duplex residentially zoned land which is either platted or has preliminary subdivision plan approval which is not expired 100 feet or 150 percent height of tower 2 whichever is greater Vacant unplatted residentially zoned lands 3 100 feet or 100 percent height of tower whichever is greater Existing multifamily residential units greater than duplex units 100 feet or 100 percent height of tower whichever is greater Nonresidentially zoned lands or nonresidential uses None; only setbacks apply

2 Separation measured from base of tower to closest building setback line. 
3 Includes any unplatted residential use properties without a valid preliminary subdivision plan or valid development plan approval and any multifamily residentially zoned land greater than duplex. 
(ii)  Separation distances between towers. 
(a)  Separation distances between towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower and preexisting towers. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation distances (listed in linear feet) shall be as shown in Table 2. 
Table 2: 
Existing Towers-Types Lattice Guyed Monopole 75 feet in height or greater Monopole less than 75 feet in height Lattice 5,000 5,000 1,500 750 Guyed 5,000 5,000 1,500 750 Monopole 75 feet in height or greater 1,500 1,500 1,500 750 Monopole less than 75 feet in height 750 750 750 750  
(6)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided however, that the council may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
(7)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special land use permit is required; provided, however, that the Council may waive such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
(i)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
(ii)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced, deferred, or waived. 
(iii)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer; in these cases, landscaping may be deferred during the time period that the natural growth provides a sufficient buffer.

    When an electrical system or equipment is maintained in violation of this Electrical Code and in violation of a notice issued pursuant to this section, the Building Official shall institute an appropriate action to prevent, restrain, correct or abate the violation. 
(g)  Connection After Order to Disconnect. Persons shall not make connections from an energy or power supply, nor supply power to an electrical system or equipment, which has been disconnected or ordered to be disconnected by the Building Official or the use of which has been ordered to be disconnected by the Building Official until the Building Official authorizes the reconnection and use of the electrical system or equipment. 
(h)  Liability. The Building Official, or an authorized representative charged with the enforcement of this Electrical Code, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of his or her duties, shall not thereby render the Building Official personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or omission in the discharge of duties. A suit brought against the Building Official or an employee because of an act or omission performed by the Building Official in the enforcement of the provisions of this Electrical Code shall be defended by legal counsel provided by the City until final termination of such proceedings. 
    This Electrical Code shall not be construed to relieve a person owning, operating or controlling any building, structure or building service equipment therein from responsibility for any damage to persons or property caused by defects, or to reduce such responsibility, nor shall the Code Enforcement Agency or its parent jurisdiction be held to assume such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this Electrical Code or approvals issued under this Electrical Code. 
(i)  Cooperation of Other Officials and Officers. The Building Official may request, and shall receive as far as is required in the discharge of his or her duties, the assistance and cooperation of other officials of the City.

(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.16. - Permit applications, issuance, etc. 
(a)  Review of Applications, Plans, Etc.; Endorsement. The application, plans, specifications and other data filed by an applicant for a permit shall be reviewed by the Building Official. Such items and data may be reviewed by other departments of the City to verify compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction. If the Building Official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this Electrical Code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees provided for in Section 1424.17 have been paid, the Building Official shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant. 
    When the Building Official issues a permit, the plans and specifications shall be endorsed in writing or stamped "approved." Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the Building Official, and all work regulated by this Electrical Code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
    The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole system have been submitted or approved, provided that adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this Electrical Code. The holders of such permits shall proceed at their own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building, structure or building service will be granted. 
(b)  Retention of Plans, Etc. One set of approved plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the Building Official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(c)  Validity and Scope of Permit. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans and specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Electrical Code, or of any other ordinances of the City. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Electrical Code or other ordinances of the City shall not be valid. 
    The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications and other data shall not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this Electrical Code or any other ordinance of the City. 
(d)  Expiration of Permit. Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this Electrical Code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall first be obtained to do so, and the fee therefor shall be one-half the amount required of a new permit for such work, provided that no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work, and provided, further, that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
    A permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may be commenced under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days upon written request from the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken. 
(e)  Suspension or Revocation of Permit. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this Electrical Code whenever the permit is issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation of the City.

(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.18. - Refund of fees. 
    Holders of permits upon which work has not been started may make written application for a refund of fees paid for such permits, provided that such application is made and attested before a notary public by the same person or corporation who or which originally applied for such permit, or by the estate of such person or the receiver of such corporation, within six months of the date of issue. Upon verifying the facts in such cases, the Manager of the Office of Building Safety shall refund 75 percent of all fees in excess of $5.00, in such manner as may be directed by the City Controller. 
(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.19. - Work without a permit; investigation; fee. 
(a)  Investigation Required. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this Electrical Code has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. 
(b)  Fee. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee that would be required by this Electrical Code if a permit were to be issued. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with the provisions of this Electrical Code and all other ordinances of the City, nor form any penalty prescribed by law. 
(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.20. - Inspections. 
(a)  In General. All electrical systems and equipment for which a permit is required by this Electrical Code shall be subject to inspection by the Building Official, and such electrical systems shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the Building Official. 
    It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the electrical system to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the Building Official nor the City shall be liable for the expense involved in the removal or replacement of any material required to permit inspection. When the installation of an electrical system and equipment is complete, an additional and final inspection shall be made. Electrical systems and equipment regulated by this Electrical Code shall not be connected to the energy source until authorized by the Building Official. 
    Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this Electrical Code or of other ordinances of the City. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel provisions of this Electrical Code or of other ordinances of the City shall not be valid. 
(b)  Inspection Requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the Building Official that such work is ready for inspection. The Building Official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone at the option of the Building Official. 
    It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by this Electrical Code to provide access to and means for inspection of such work. 
(c)  Notification of Electrical Inspector. No person conducting or performing work covered by a permit required by this chapter shall fail to notify the Electrical Inspector when such work has been completed. No person shall conceal any portion of such work until it has been inspected and approved by the Electrical Inspector. If the work is found to be properly performed and safe, a certificate of inspection shall, if requested, be issued. The Electrical Inspector shall have the authority to order any person to make such corrections of work as are deemed necessary by the Inspector in order to bring such work into compliance with this chapter. 
(d)  Operation and Inspection of Replacement Work. The requirements of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the operation of any electrical system or equipment installed to replace existing equipment. The request for reinspection of such equipment must have been filed with the Building Official not more than 48 hours after such replacement work is completed and before any portion of such electrical system is concealed by any permanent portion of the building. 
(e)  Other Inspections. In addition to the inspections required by this Electrical Code, the Building Official may make or require other inspections of any work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Electrical Code and other laws which are enforced by the Code Enforcement Agency. 
(f)  Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when the portion of work for which inspection is called for is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. 
    This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Electrical Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspections. 
    Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the Inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. 
    To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing, upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with fee schedule adopted by Council. 
    In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid. 
(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.21. - Connections; approval required. 
(a)  In General. An electrical system or equipment regulated by this Electrical Code, for which a permit is required, shall not be connected to a source of energy or power until the same is approved by the Building Official. 
(b)  Temporary Connections. The Building Official may authorize a temporary connection of an electrical system or equipment to a source of energy or power for the purpose of testing the equipment, or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.98. - Issuance of municipal civil infraction citations and violation notices. 
    All electrical inspectors and the Building Official are hereby designated as the Authorized City officials to issue Municipal civil infraction citations (directing alleged violators to appear in court) or Municipal civil infraction violation notices (directing alleged violators to appear at the Municipal Ordinance Violations Bureau) as provided in Chapter 203 of these Codified Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 1002,  1, 3-15-99) 
1424.99. - Penalty.

1442.11. - Design and construction. 
(a)  Design. 
(1)  General. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind and seismic forces as specified in this section. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. The overturning moment produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds of the dead-load resisting moment. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead-load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. 
(2)  Wind loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind forces as specified in Chapter 23 of the Uniform Building Code. 
(3)  Sesmic loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist seismic forces as specified in Chapter 23 of the Uniform Building Code. 
(4)  Combined loads. Wind and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures; only that loading producing the larger stresses need be used. 
Vertical design loads, except roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind or seismic loads. 
(5)  Allowable stresses. The design of wood, concrete, steel or aluminum members shall conform to the requirements of Chapters 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Uniform Building Code. Loads both vertical and horizontal, exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in Chapter 29 of the Uniform Building Code. The working stresses of wire rope and its fastenings shall not exceed 25 percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fasteners. Working stresses for wind or seismic loads combined with dead loads may be increased as specified in Chapter 23 of the Uniform Building Code. 
(b)  Construction. 
(1)  General. The supports for all signs or sign structures shall be placed in or upon private property and shall be securely built, constructed and erected in conformance with the requirements of this Building and Housing Code. 
(2)  Materials. Materials of construction for signs and sign structures shall be of the quality and grade specified for buildings in the Uniform Building Code. In all signs and sign structures the materials and details of construction shall, in the absence of specified requirements, conform with the following: 
Structural steel shall be of such quality as to conform with U.B C Standard No. 27-1. Secondary members in contact with or directly supporting the display surface may be formed of light gauge steel, provided such members are designed in accordance with the specifications of the design of light gauge steel as specified in U.B.C. Standard No. 27-9, and in addition shall be galvanized. Secondary members, when formed integrally with the display surface, shall be not less than 0.024 inch in thickness. When not formed integrally with the display surface, the minimum thickness of the secondary members shall be 0.10 inch. The minimum thickness of hot-rolled steel members furnishing structural support for signs shall be one-quarter inch, except that, if galvanized, such members shall be not less than one-eighth inch thick. Steel pipes shall be of such quality as to conform with U.B.C. Standard No. 27-1. Steel members may be connected with one galvanized bolt, provided the connection is adequate to transfer the stresses in the members. Anchors and supports, when of wood and embedded in the soil, or within six inches of the soil, shall be of all hardwood of a durable species or shall be pressure-treated with an approved preservative. Such members shall be marked or branded by an approved agency.

Braced ground signs shall be anchored to resist the specified wind or seismic load acting in any direction. Anchors and supports shall be designed for safe bearing loads on the soil and for an effective resistance to pullout amounting to a force 25 percent greater than the required resistance to overturning. Anchors and supports shall penetrate to a depth below ground greater than that of the frost line. Mobile temporary signs supported by frames or posts rigidly attached to the base shall be so proportioned that the weight and size of the base will be adequate to resist the wind pressure specified in this chapter. Signs attached to masonry, concrete or steel shall be safely and securely fastened thereto by means of metal anchors, bolts or approved expansion screws of sufficient size and anchorage to safely support the loads applied. 
No wooden blocks or plugs or anchors with wood used in connection with screws or nails shall be considered proper anchorage, except in the case of signs attached to wood framing. 
No anchor or support of any sign shall be connected to or supported by an unbraced parapet wall, unless such wall is designed in accordance with the requirements for parapet walls specified for seismic zones in the Uniform Building Code. 
(c)  Illumination; Wiring Installation; Open Spark or Flame Prohibited. No sign shall be illuminated by other than electrical devices.

(Ord. No. 825, 10-8-90) 
1442.22. - Billboards. 
(a)  Finding of fact regarding tobacco use by minors and billboard advertising of tobacco products. It is hereby found and declared that: 
(1)  Outdoor advertisements are a unique and distinguishable medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation, as the Supreme Court recognized in Packer Corporation v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105(1932) by citing with approval the following excerpt from the opinion of the Utah Supreme court: 
Advertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers on the streets ... to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part. Other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer. The young people as well as the adults have the message of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce. In the case of newspapers and magazines, there must be some seeking by the one who is to see and read the advertisement. The radio can be turned off, but not so the billboard ... these distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class. This is impossible with respect to newspapers and magazines. 
(2)  The Supreme Court and other courts have recognized the positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a variety of goods and services, such as electricity, see, Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n. 447 U.S. 557, 569 (1980) ("There is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity. Central Hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sale.") Gambling, see Posades de Puerto Rico Assoc. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 341-42 (1986) ("The Puerto Rico Legislature obviously believed, when it enacted the advertising restrictions at issue here, that advertising of casino gambling aimed at the residents of Puerto Rico would serve to increase the demand for the product advertised. We think the legislature's belief is a reasonable one ..."; cigarettes, see Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 33 F. Supp. 582,586 (D.D.C. 1971) (Three-judge Court) (Noting "close relationship between cigarette commercials broadcast on the electronic media and their potential influence on young people.") Aff'd per curiam, 405 U.S. 1000 (1972); and alcohol, see Dunagin v. City of Oxford, 718 F.2D 738,747-71 (1983) (Extensively reviewing evidence on connection between liquor advertising and consumption and rejecting interbrand competition argument), Cert. Den., 104 S. Ct. 3533 (1984); 
(3)  Ninety percent of all new smokers are age 18 and younger. In two surveys, at least 86 percent of teen smokers smoked only one of three brands - Marlboro, Camel or Newport. Teen cigarette smoking is an early warning sign for other illegal youth behavior. Teens who smoke are three times more likely than nonsmokers to use alcohol, eight times more likely to use marijuana, and 22 times more likely to use cocaine. The average smoker starts smoking at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by age 141/2. 
(4)  The consumption of tobacco by minors is illegal in the City of Lansing. 
(5)  Despite the illegality of tobacco consumption, the use of tobacco is prevalent among City of Lansing youth. 
(6)  Increased illegal tobacco consumption among Lansing youth also contributes to increased use of other illegal drugs and truancy. 
(7)  Tobacco billboard advertising in the City of Lansing is prevalent and disproportionately higher than tobacco billboard advertising in the remainder of Ingham County. 
(8)  The vast majority of Lansing billboards, with the exception of those located on highways, are located on arterials used by Lansing school children for school travel. 
(9)  Tobacco billboard advertising inevitably results in increased illegal tobacco consumption by Lansing youth. 
(10)  Due to the prevalence of tobacco billboard advertising in Lansing, as well as the location of Lansing schools accessible by major arterials, it is impossible for Lansing youth to avoid tobacco billboard exposure. 
(11)  In recognition of the legitimate business interests, as well as first amendment rights of tobacco manufacturers, this section does not restrict less intrusive advertising or tobacco advertising on interstate highways.
