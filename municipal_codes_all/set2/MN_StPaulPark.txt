PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of St. Paul Park, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through November 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Barry Sittlow, City Administrator, and Jim Shiely, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.

The inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and

(Code 1982, § 10.07) 
Sec. 1-13. - General penalty. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or city ordinance shall be punished as a misdemeanor, that is, with a fine of up to $700.00 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or by both such fine and imprisonment, unless otherwise provided in this Code. The term "misdemeanor" shall be as defined in M.S.A. § 609.02, subd. 3. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In case of the amendment by the city council of any section of this Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to the section, as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a specified penalty other than the aforementioned general penalty is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so specified shall be held to relate to the amended section, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.

Chapter 7 - SOCIAL HOST 

Sec. 7-1. - Purpose and findings. 
    The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council finds that: 
(a)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 may be harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health. 
(b)  Prohibiting underage consumption protects underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
(c)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have adverse effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(d)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(e)  Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, this ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
(f)  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

Sec. 14-31. - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the South St. Paul Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity and located within the city, and also if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, tending to destroy or impair the utility of the South St. Paul Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. 
(2)  The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the South St. Paul Airport including the city. 
(3)  For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare and for the promotion of the most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards. 
(4)  The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without compensation. 
(5)  The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds. 
(Code 1982, § 16.030) 
Sec. 14-32. - Definitions.

    Airport elevation means the established elevation of the highest point of the usable landing area. This elevation has been established to be 820 feet, mean sea level datum. 
    Airport hazard means any structure, tree or use of land which obstructs the air space required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at the airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or taking off of aircraft and any use of land which is hazardous to persons or property because of the proximity to the airport. 
    Dwelling means any building or portion thereof designed or used as a residence or sleeping place of one or more persons. 
    Height, for the purpose of determining the height limits or elevations in all zones set forth in this article and shown on the official map on file in the city administrator's office, the datum shall mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
    Nonconforming use means any structure, tree, or use of land which does not conform to a regulation prescribed in this article or an amendment thereto, as of the effective date of such regulation. 
    Slope means an incline from the horizontal expressed in an arithmetic ratio of horizontal magnitude to vertical magnitude; slope of 3:1 equals three feet horizontal to one foot vertical. 
    Structure means an object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, and overhead transmission lines.

(1)  Primary zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary primary surface 500 feet in width longitudinally centered on the runway, and extends 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. Although no portion of the city lies within the primary zone as defined herein, the definition of this zone is given so that the location of the horizontal surface and conical surface, as defined in this section, can be ascertained. 
(2)  Horizontal surface. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation, or a height of 970 feet above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 6,000 feet. 
(3)  Conical surface. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.

Sec. 14-34. - Height restrictions. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article and except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no structure or tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any airspace zone created in section 14-33 so as to project above any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described in section 14-33. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitations shall prevail. 
(Code 1982, § 16.033) 
Sec. 14-35. - Land use restrictions. 
    In order to carry out the purpose of this article and in order to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operation to and from the South St. Paul Municipal Airport, all land included within the perimeters of the horizontal surface shown on the official map on file in the office of the city administrator is declared a safety zone and, in addition to the height restrictions imposed by the provisions of section 14-34, no use shall be made of any land in such safety zone which: 
(1)  Creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft; 
(2)  Makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights; 
(3)  Results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport;

    The regulations prescribed in this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this article, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this article shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any structure which was begun prior to the effective date of this article and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two years thereof.

    Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his property not in accordance with this article may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the regulation in question. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations in this article would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but that substantial justice be done and that such variance shall be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations; provided, that any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable condition that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this article. In determining whether a variance shall be granted pursuant to the terms of this article, the board of adjustment shall carefully consider the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration then in force and effect in relation to obstructions, marking and lighting. 
(Code 1982, § 16.036) 
Sec. 14-38. - Hazard marking and lighting of nonconforming uses. 
    The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city engineer to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of airport hazards. Provided, however, that the installation, operation and maintenance of any such markers and lights shall be at the expense of the City of South St. Paul.

(Ord. No. 569, 7-17-00) 
Sec. 14-40. - Conflicting regulations.

(Code 1982, § 24.016; Ord. No. 710, § 1, 11-3-14) 
Sec. 26-37. - Procedure. 
(a)  Notice of violation. Whenever, in the judgment of an officer charged with enforcement of the provisions of this article, it is determined upon investigation that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists within the city, such officer shall notify in writing the person committing or maintaining such public nuisance and require such person to terminate and abate such nuisance and to remove such conditions or remedy such defects. Such written notice shall be personally served on the person committing or maintaining such nuisance or mailed to the property owner of record. The notice shall set forth the action required of the owner or occupant of such premises necessary to abate the nuisance, and shall specify the maximum time for the abatement of the nuisance after service of such notice, which time shall in no event exceed 30 days. Service of notice shall be proved by filing of an affidavit of service in the office of the city administrator setting forth the manner and time thereof. 
(b)  Appeal. Any property owner who feels aggrieved by an order issued pursuant to this section may request a hearing before the city council. Such request shall be filed in writing with the city within 14 days after the date of service of the notice by the city. The city shall notify the property owner of the date, time, and place of the hearing before the council. The hearing shall be conducted no more than 30 days after the filing of the request. The city council shall make findings to determine if a nuisance condition is present as identified in the notice. If the council affirms the notice of violation, the council shall determine a compliance date no more than 20 days from the date of the hearing for compliance. Failure to hold the hearing or failure to affirm the notice of violation terminates the process identified in section 26-37(a) but does not preclude the officers of the city from issuing any subsequent notices. Upon holding the hearing, the council may cause to have a new notice of violation issues citing other conditions and remedies than has been identified by the officer following the procedure in section 26-37(a). 
(c)  Order of abatement. Upon lack of compliance by the date in the notice in section 26-37(a) or in the council order in section 26-37(b), the city may issue an order of abatement as identified in section 26-38. 
(Code 1982, § 24.017; Ord. No. 710, § 1, 11-3-14) 
Sec. 26-38. - Abatement. 
(a)  Abatement by council. When any notice given pursuant to section 26-37 is not complied with, such noncompliance shall be reported forthwith to the council for such action as may be necessary and deemed advisable by the council to abate and enjoin the further continuation of such nuisance. Unless the nuisance shall constitute a present serious threat to the health or safety of the habitants of the city, prior to authorizing expenditures to abate and enjoin the further continuation of such nuisance, the city administrator shall notify in writing the persons committing or maintaining such public nuisances, advising such person of the action contemplated by the city and notifying such person that the person shall have seven days from receipt of such notice within which to appeal the contemplated action to the city council. A hearing on such appeal shall be set by the city administrator for the next available meeting of the city council and such person appealing shall be notified of the time, date and place of such hearing. Notice shall be considered served upon mailing or service upon the property. Upon holding the hearing, the council may order the abatement of the nuisance. 
(b)  Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and notice requirements as set forth in section 26-37 and [subsection] 26-38(a) will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare, the city council may order summary enforcement and abatement of the nuisance. To proceed with summary enforcement, the designated official shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on property in the city and that delay in abatement will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The designated official shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the property of the nature of the nuisance, and that public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by a delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in section 26-37 and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the city council may order summary enforcement and abatement of the nuisance.

As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the city clerk or other city official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  Civil penalty. The city may also add an additional civil penalty to the amount in subsection (a) not to exceed 25 percent of the total amount. 
(c)  Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in Minn. Stat. 429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled portion of the streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the city clerk shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under Minn. Stat. 429.101 against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The city council may then spread the charges against the property under that statute and any other pertinent statutes for certification to the county auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding 10, as the city council may determine in each case. 
(Code 1982, § 24.019; Ord. No. 710, § 1, 11-3-14)

(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-18. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city council may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and a hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-19. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city council prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-20. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devises as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devises used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of the facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(7)  If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the city is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-21. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-22. - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-23. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10)

(7)  The notice shall state that the determination of violation may be appealed to the city administrator by filing with the city clerk a written notice of appeal within seven calendar days of service of the notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-25. - Enforcement measures after appeal. 
    If the violation had not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 15 days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(Ord. No. 657, § 1, 7-6-10) 
Sec. 28-26. - Cost of abatement of the violation. 
    Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 15 days.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 652, § 1, adopted February 1, 2010, amended Article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Article II, §§ 34-31-34-34-41, 34-61, 34-62, 34-86-34-92, 34-111-34-113, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 507, § 1, 8-5-91. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 34-31. - Findings and purpose. 
    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The provisions of this article are based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the state department of natural resources, and it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in this article by provisions contained herein. This article is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 34-32. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
    Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
    Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist and that the structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and is compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
    Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
    Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the state of a lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
    Flood frequency means the average frequency, statistically determined, for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the floodway fringe used in the flood insurance study for Washington County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas. 
    Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or may be covered by the regional flood. 
    Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
    Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "travel trailer/travel vehicle." 
    Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either by itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
    Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
    Reach means a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
    Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in the state and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term base flood as used in the flood insurance study. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation means an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
    Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel trailers and vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in section 34-113 and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(b)  Any alteration of an "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure". For the purpose of this article, "historic structure" shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, part 59.1. 
    Travel trailer/travel vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control, including any required by this article, to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstances as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

h.  Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
(4)  Standards for floodway conditional uses: 
a.  All uses: 
1.  No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
2.  All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in section 34-89. 
3.  The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists. 
b.  Fill: 
1.  Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. 
2.  Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan. 
3.  As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (4)b.2. of this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood, but only after the city council has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the office of the county recorder. 
c.  Accessory structures: 
1.  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 
2.  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters. Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and, so far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
3.  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the state building code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards, as appropriate: 
(i)  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and 
(ii)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed. 
(iii)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. 
d.  Storage of materials and equipment: 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
2.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
e.  Structural works affecting watercourses: 
1.  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of M.S.A. ch. 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.

(Ord. No. 652, § 1, 2-1-10) 
Sec. 34-62. - Flood fringe district. 
    The following provisions shall apply in the flood fringe district (FF): 
(1)  Permitted uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use districts. If no preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the flood fringe district provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe district permitted uses listed in subsection (2) of this section and the standards for all flood fringe uses listed in subsection (5) of this section. 
(2)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses: 
a.  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, including basement, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
b.  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be internally floodproofed in accordance with section 34-61. 
c.  The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless such fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (2)a. of this section. 
d.  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
e.  The provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall apply. 
(3)  Conditional uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsection (2)a. or (2)b. of this section or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in subsection (2)c. or (2)d. of this section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections (4) and (5) of this section and section 34-89. 
(4)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses: 
a.  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or abovegrade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: (i) the enclosed area is abovegrade on at least one side of the structure; (ii) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and (iii) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. These alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
2.  Specific standards for abovegrade, enclosed areas. Abovegrade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
i.  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a small net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
ii.  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood-resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
b.  Basements, as defined by section 34-32, shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
2.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (4)c. of this section. 
c.  All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
d.  When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
e.  Storage of materials and equipment: 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
2.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the council. 
f.  The provisions of subsection (5) of this section shall also apply. 
(5)  Standards for all flood fringe uses: 
a.  Reserved for future use. 
b.  Commercial uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
c.  Manufacturing and industrial uses: Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in subsection (5)b. of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
d.  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation; FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
e.  Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
f.  Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in section 34-113. 
g.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Sec. 34-63. - General floodplain district. 
(1)  Permitted uses: 
a.  The uses listed in section 34-61(1) of this article shall be permitted uses. 
b.  All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to section 34-63(2). Section 34-61 shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway district and section 34-62 shall apply if the proposed use is in the flood fringe district. 
(2)  Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations within the general floodplain district. 
a.  Information required. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is in the floodway or the flood fringe district: 
1.  A typical valley cross section showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 
2.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site and the locations and elevations of streets. 
3.  Photographs showing existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil types. 
4.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
b.  The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed uses in the floodway or flood fringe district and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000-6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall: 
1.  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood. 
2.  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
3.  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5 feet shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(3)  Once the 100-year flood elevation and floodway and flood fringe boundaries have been determined, the zoning administrator shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of section 34-61 and 34-62 of this article.

In the granting of such variance, the board of adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this article, any other zoning regulations in this city, and in the respective enabling legislation which justified the granting of the variance. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied: 
(1)  Variances shall not be issued by this city within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued by this city upon: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(d)  Hearings; notice. Upon filing with the board of adjustment of an appeal from a decision of the building inspector, or an application for a variance, the board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due notice to the parties in interest as specified by law. The board of adjustment shall submit by mail to the commissioner of natural resources a copy of the application for proposed variance sufficiently in advance so that the commissioner will receive at least ten days' notice of the hearing.

Such notices shall be personally served upon the owners of such properties or shall be given by registered or certified mail. Mailed notices shall be deemed to have been delivered when the notices have been deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the owner or owners of such properties, with postage prepaid thereon. For the purpose of giving notice, owners shall be those shown to be such on the records of the county auditor or the county treasurer. 
(d)  Notice to city of completion of work. Any owner of property complying with a notice given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall notify the city administrator when the required work has been completed. 
(e)  Restoration by city. If the property owner shall fail to comply with the notice given pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the city administrator shall cause such sidewalk to be removed and the vacated sidewalk area to be restored as provided in this section, such work to be accomplished either by day labor or pursuant to a contract entered into by the city for that purpose. The cost of removing such sidewalk and restoration of the vacated sidewalk area shall be assessed against the benefited properties pursuant to the applicable provisions of M.S.A. § 429.101. 
(f)  Exemption. This section shall not apply to sidewalks listed in the city's sidewalk maintenance map for maintenance by the city.

(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-44. - Right-of-way patching and restoration. 
(a)  Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under section 58-47. 
(b)  Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore the right-of-way itself. 
(1)  City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty days of billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work.

The permittee upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under section 58-47. 
(e)  Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-45. - Joint applications. 
(a)  Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time. 
(b)  Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications. 
(c)  With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-46. - Supplementary applications. 
(a)  Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension. 
(b)  Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-47. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minn. Stat. § 216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. Rules chapter 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work. 
(b)  Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. 
(c)  Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
(d)  Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in Minn. Stat. chapter 216d and Minn. Rules chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the director. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-48. - Denial of permit. 
    The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and conditions of this article or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-49. - Installation requirements. 
    The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minn. Stat. § 237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn. Rules chapter 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in section 58-54 subd. (b) of this article.

(c)  Authority of director. 
(1)  At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. 
(2)  The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section 58-53. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-51. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated 
    Therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for the actions it took in response to the emergency. 
    If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the City Code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-52. - Supplementary notification. 
    If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this information is known. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-53. - Revocation of permits. 
(a)  Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or 
(5)  The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 58-50. 
(b)  Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit authorization. 
(e)  Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(f)  Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-54. - Mapping data. 
(a)  Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of all equipment installed, owned and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration. 
(b)  Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this paragraph (b) and with applicable Gopher State One Call Law and Minn. Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for 1) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those under Minn. Stat. chapter 429, and 2) city approval of performance under development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minn. Stat. chapter 462. The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-55. - Location and relocation of facilities. 
(a)  [Generally.] Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities. 
(b)  Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. 
    Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant. 
(c)  Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition. 
(d)  Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-56. - Pre-excavation facilities location. 
    In addition to complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. § 216d.01-.09 ("one call excavation notice system") before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-57. - Damage to other facilities. 
    When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-58. - Right-of-way vacation. 
    Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a registrant, the registrant's rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minn. Rules 7819.3200. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-59. - Indemnification and liability 
    By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule 7819.1250. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-60. - Abandoned and unusable facilities. 
(a)  Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the registrant's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way under this article have been lawfully assumed by another registrant. 
(b)  Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation, or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-61. - Appeal. 
    A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the director regarding section 58-54(b) of this article may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the city council. The city council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right-of-way user has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the city council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision. 
(Ord. No. 625, § 1, 11-6-06) 
Sec. 58-62. - Severability. 
    If any portion of this article is for any reason held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this article precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

Sec. 58-86. - Specifications. 
    In order to comply with this article, building numbers shall be Arabic numerals, unless otherwise approved by the building official. Other types of numbers shall be approved unless they are so decorative as to be difficult to read. In addition, numbers shall have a minimum height of three inches and shall be mounted in a secure fashion to the building's front wall or to a porch or other fixed appurtenance in front of the building in the general vicinity of the main entryway or main path of travel which leads to the main entrance from a public street or shall be otherwise separately mounted in an approved manner upon the face of a wall or upon a post in the front yard of the premises. Building numbers shall be mounted at a height between four feet and ten feet above the ground. They shall be sufficiently legible as to contrasting background, arrangement, spacing, size and uniformity of integers so that the numbers may be read with ease during daylight hours by a person possessing at least 20/40 vision viewing the numbers from the centerline of the abutting street opposite those points where regularly used pedestrian or vehicular accessways enter the public roadway. The numbers shall be so placed that trees, shrubs and other obstructions do not block the line of sight of the numbers from the center of the street to any appreciable degree. Where two or more nonresidential buildings back up to any public alley or private accessway, the building number shall also be displayed at the rear of the buildings in the same manner as in the front. 
(Code 1982, § 12.010) 
Sec. 58-87. - Assignment of numbers. 
    Numbers shall be assigned to houses and buildings, from Main Street and from Second Avenue as bases, in the following manner: 
(1)  All houses and buildings situated within the first block west of Main Street on all intersecting streets shall be given numbers between one and 99, inclusive; within the second block, numbers between 100 and 199, inclusive, shall be used, and so on in each succeeding block; and all numbers shall be indicated by adding the word "West" to the name of the street. 
(2)  In like manner, the numbers between one and 99, inclusive, shall be used in the first block east of Main Street on intersecting streets, and each succeeding hundred in each succeeding block; and the word "East" shall be added to the street name. 
(3)  On streets running south from Second Avenue, numbers between 200 and 299, inclusive, shall be used within the first block and each succeeding hundred in each succeeding block. 
(4)  Odd numbers shall be used on the west and north sides of the streets and even numbers on the east and south sides of the streets, respectively, and within any block, the houses or buildings nearer the base street shall use the smaller number. 
(5)  To provide for the numbering of future constructions, two numbers shall be reserved for each lot, regardless of the width of such lot. 
(6)  Where houses or buildings are placed across lengths of lots facing side streets, numbers on such side streets are to be computed, one number for each 25 feet. 
(Code 1982, § 12.011) 
Sec. 58-88. - Plat certificates; duty of city administrator. 
    Whenever any house or other building is to be erected, a number shall be assigned at the time the building permit is granted therefor. On or before January 31 of each year, it shall be the duty of the city administrator to prepare certificates stating the new numbers assigned during the preceding calendar year, and send one copy thereof to the county recorder for attaching to the plat of the city, and to attach another to the plat in the office of the city administrator. Such numbers may be appropriately entered upon such plats.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 62-1. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the subdivision ordinance of the city, and will be referred to herein as "this chapter." 
(Code 1982, § 31.010) 
Sec. 62-2. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city finds that the process of dividing raw land into homesites, or separate parcels for other uses, is one of the most important factors in the growth of any community. Few activities have a more lasting effect upon its appearance and environment. Once the land has been subdivided into urban lots and the streets, homes, and other structures have been constructed, the basic character of this permanent addition to the community has become firmly established. It is then virtually impossible to alter its basic character without substantial expense. In most subdivisions, roads and streets must be maintained and various public services must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the general public, the developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards.

(2)  Access. Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the subdivision, and to adjacent unsubdivided parcels unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible. Reserved strips, and landlocked areas shall not be created. 
(3)  Continuation. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas. 
(4)  Future subdivision. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, but may be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new subdivision at appropriate locations. 
(5)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic. Thoroughfares shall be reserved for through traffic by providing marginal access streets, interior streets for serving lots, or other means. 
(6)  Half streets. Half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and standards of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured. 
(7)  Existing half streets. Wherever a tract to be subdivided adjoins an existing half, or partial street, the part of the street within such tract shall be platted. 
(8)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sac streets. 
(9)  Private streets. Private streets and reserve strips shall be prohibited and no public improvements shall be approved for any private street. All streets shall be dedicated for public use. 
(10)  Frontage roads. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or planned major thoroughfare or a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such thoroughfare and right-of-way may be required for adequate protection of residential properties and separation of through and local traffic. Such service streets shall be located at a distance from the major thoroughfare or railroad right-of-way suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial and industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(11)  Hardship. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. 
(b)  Cul-de-sac streets. 
(1)  Cul-de-sac streets, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed 500 feet in length, except as permitted by variance. Such a variance may be granted if it can be clearly shown that, by reason of unfavorable land form or the irregular shape of the land from which the subdivision is being made, a normal street pattern cannot be established, or that land would be wasted by not granting such a variance. 
(2)  Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround right-of-way of a cul-de-sac street shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to such property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the acreage covered by the turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the property owner fronting on the temporary turnaround. 
(c)  Street widths. 
(1)  Minimum right-of-way widths and pavement widths (face to face of curb) for each type of public street or road shall be as follows: 
Type of street Right-of-way 
width 
(feet) Roadway width 
(feet) Arterial 120 As determined by 
traffic needs Collector street  80 44 Commercial or industrial service street  80 44 Minor street  66 36 Cul-de-sac  60-foot turnaround 
radius 45-foot turnaround 
radius  
(2)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of inadequate width, sufficient additional width shall be provided to meet the above standards. 
(3)  Additional right-of-way and roadway widths may be required to promote public safety and convenience when special conditions require it or to provide parking space in areas of intensive use. 
(4)  Extensions of existing streets with lesser right-of-way than prescribed under this subsection (c) may be permitted by variance in special cases. 
(d)  Access to thoroughfares. Access of minor streets onto state and county state aid highways shall be discouraged at intervals of less than 500 feet. 
(e)  Dimensional features. 
(1)  Street jog. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be allowed. 
(2)  Deflection. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 100 feet. 
(3)  Grades. Centerline gradients shall be at least 0.4 percent and shall not exceed the following: 
Classification  Gradient 
(in percent) Arterials and collector streets  5 Local streets, marginal access streets  8  
(4)  Vertical curves. Different connecting street gradients shall be connected with vertical curves. Minimum length, in feet, of these curves shall be 20 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes. 
(5)  Angle of intersection. The angle formed by any intersecting of streets shall not be less than 60 degrees, with 90-degree intersections preferred. 
(6)  Size of intersection. Intersections of more than four corners shall be prohibited. 
(7)  Corner radii. Roadways of street intersections shall be rounded by a radius of not less than 15 feet. Roadways of street-alley intersections shall be rounded by a radius of not less than six feet. Corners at the entrances to the turnaround portions of culs-de-sac shall be rounded by a radius of not less than 15 feet. 
(f)  Curb and gutter. Concrete curb and gutter shall be included as part of the required street surface improvement and shall thus be designed for installation along both sides of all roadways. 
(g)  Street trees. Street trees shall not be less than 50 feet apart with a minimum of two per lot. They shall be placed in the boulevard. 
(h)  Street names. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names unless a new street is a continuation of or in alignment with the existing or platted street. In that event it shall bear the same name of the existing or platted street so in alignment.

(b)  Lot dimensions. 
(1)  Corner lots shall be platted at least 20 feet wider than interior lots. 
(2)  Butt lots in any subdivision are to be discouraged. Where such lots must be used to fit a particular type of design, they shall be platted at least five feet wider than the average width of interior lots in the block. 
(3)  Through or double frontage lots shall not be permitted except where such lots abut a thoroughfare or major highway. Such lots shall have an additional depth of ten feet for screen planting along the rear lot line. 
(4)  Watercourses. Lots abutting upon a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall have an additional depth or width as required to assure that building sites are not subject to flooding. 
(c)  Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a large tract must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as to future use rather than be allowed to remain as unusable parcels. 
(d)  Access to thoroughfares. In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to an arterial or collector street, vehicular access from individual lots to such streets and roads shall be limited to respect the function of those streets. 
(Code 1982, § 31.065)

Sec. 66-61. - Findings and purpose. 
    Abandoned motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the people of the city in that such vehicles can harbor noxious diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to the safety and well-being of the children of the citizens. Abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the city and, therefore, a detriment to the environment. The abandonment and retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitutes a waste of a valuable source of useful metal. It is, therefore, in the public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metals be eliminated and that future abandonment of motor vehicles and other scrap metals be prevented.

Such term shall also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to the city. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined in M.S.A. § 168.10, shall not be considered an abandoned motor vehicle within the meaning of this article. For the purpose of this article, any vehicle moved a distance of not more than two blocks during such 48-hour period shall be deemed to have remained stationary. 
    Motor vehicle means every device in, upon or by which any person is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, which device is self-propelled and not deriving its power from overhead wires; except devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.

The connection of connecting sewer onto the city sanitary sewer shall be made only at the wye branch. If no properly located wye branch is available, the owner may be permitted at his expense to make connection at a location and in the manner specified by the public works department. 
(Code 1982, § 26.012) 
Sec. 70-79. - Same-Application. 
(a)  Any person desiring sanitary sewer services from the city for premises not previously connected with the system shall apply to the public works supervisor. Application shall be supplemented by plans, specifications, or other information as may be required by the public works supervisor and shall be accompanied, in addition to all other charges due pursuant to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, by a permit and inspection fee as set forth in chapter 42 of this Code. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection shall be borne by the owner, and the owner shall indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the sewer connection, including restoring street surfacing. All such permits shall expire 90 days after the date issued and a new permit shall be required for any unfinished work covered by such permit. 
(b)  If application is made for sewer service to property which, prior to the date of such application, has never been assessed by the city for benefits accruing to such property for the construction of the city sewer system and general appurtenances thereto, then and in every such event, no permit shall be issued for the connection of such property to the city sewer system unless, prior thereto, the applicant shall pay to the city administrator such amount as may be determined by the city council to be the just and equitable benefit which has accrued to such property by virtue of the construction of the city sewer system and appurtenances thereto. 
(c)  If application is made for sewer service to property which, prior to the date of such application, has been assessed for benefits accruing thereto for construction of the city sewer system and general appurtenances thereto and which assessments have been cancelled, prior to full payment, by action other than official action of the city council, then and in every such event, no permit shall be issued for connection of such property to the city sewer system unless, prior thereto, the applicant shall pay to the city administrator the total unpaid balance of such assessment, together with interest thereon from the date of such cancellation to the date of such application. 
(d)  Once a connection to the city's sewer system has been established, it cannot be terminated nor a septic tank installed to handle the property's waste.

Sec. 70-80. - Construction of building sewer. 
    A separate and independent sewer shall be provided for every building except where the building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway. In such case the sewer connection from the front building may be extended to the rear building upon the written approval of the public works supervisor and the whole shall be considered as a single sewer connection. The size and slope of the connecting sewer shall be subject to the approval of the public works department, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. It shall be required that the wye connection and the building drain shall be uncovered and the differential elevation be determined before construction is begun. Where practicable, the building connection shall be laid on a uniform grade between these two points. Whenever possible, a connecting sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. In all buildings in which the building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the city sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the city sewer. All excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trenchwork unless otherwise approved by the public works department. 
(Code 1982, § 26.014) 
Sec. 70-81. - Inspection required; protection of excavations; installation work by licensed plumber.

(Code 1982, §§ 26.020-26.023) 
Sec. 70-93. - Sewer service availability and connection charge. 
(a)  Establishment of charges. For the purpose of paying costs of reserve capacity allocated to the city each year by the metropolitan waste control commission, there is hereby established a charge for: 
(1)  The availability of treatment works and interceptors comprising the metropolitan disposal system; and 
(2)  Connections, direct and indirect, to the metropolitan disposal system. 
Such charge is imposed on each building or structure in the city and each connection to the metropolitan disposal system directly or through the city's system inside any sewer service area established by the metropolitan waste control commission, construction of which is commenced on or after the effective date of this section. The charge shall be payable upon the issuance of a building permit or a connection permit, as the case may be, but no charge shall be due upon the issuance of a connection permit if a charge was paid upon issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  Charges. The charge for each building or structure shall be equal to the number of units of sewage volume which it will discharge multiplied by the annual fee established by the metropolitan waste control commission pursuant to law. A unit of sewage volume shall be 100,000 gallons per year and shall be assigned as follows: 
(1)  Single-family houses, townhouses and duplex units shall each comprise one unit. 
(2)  Condominiums and apartments shall each comprise 80 percent of a unit. 
(3)  Mobile homes shall each comprise 80 percent of a unit. 
(4)  Other buildings and structures shall be assigned one unit for each 100,000 gallons of flow or part thereof which it is estimated they will discharge. 
(5)  Public housing units and housing units subsidized under any federal program for low and moderate income housing shall be counted as 75 percent of the unit equivalent for that type of housing. 
(c)  Administration. The city administrator shall prepare or revise building permit or sewage connection permit application forms to provide information necessary for the computation of the number of units assignable to the building or structure in question, and shall collect the applicable charge before issuance of a permit. The city administrator shall make such information available to the metropolitan waste control commission upon request. If, upon filing a report covering such permit with the metropolitan waste control commission, the commission determines that a greater number of units is assignable to the building or structure in question, any additional amount of cost allocated to the city as a result of such determination shall be paid by the person to whom the permit was granted. 
(Code 1982, §§ 26.030-26.032) 
Sec. 70-94. - Sewage strength charges. 
(a)  Intent. In order for the city to pay additional sewage costs of the metropolitan waste control commission resulting from strength of sewage discharge from the city, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. 
(b)  Establishment of strength charges. For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the metropolitan waste control commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge, based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city, referred to in this section as the strength charge. 
(c)  Strength charge formula. For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established by subsection (b) of this section, the following formulas shall be used in arriving at such computation: 
(1)  Strength charge formula: 
SCF = SR  r SS (SS-SS o ) 
_____
SS o r cod (COD-COD o ) 
_____
COD o  
Where: 
SCF = Strength charge factor SR = Strength phase ratio (strength costs to system costs for administration and O & M of treatment works) r SS = Suspended solids cost ratio r cod = Chemical oxygen demand cost ratio SS = Suspended solids concentration of discharge (SS SS) SS 0 = Suspended solids concentration of base COD = Chemical oxygen demand concentration of discharge (COD COD) COD 0 = Chemical oxygen demand concentration of base  
(2)  Strength charge: 
SC = (SCF) (V) (TW) 
Where: 
SC = Strength charge SCF = Strength charge factor V = Volume of discharge TW = Treatment work unit cost  
Such formula is based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate cost of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the commission. 
(d)  Payment of strength charge. It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength charge established by subsection (b) of this section shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto before the 20th day next succeeding the date of billing to such user by or on behalf of the city, and such payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent per month on the unpaid balance due. 
(e)  Establishment of tax lien. As provided by M.S.A. § 444.075, subd. 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge established by subsection (b) of this section is not paid before the 60th day next succeeding the date of billing to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, such delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the city or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy.

(Ord. No. 613, § 4, 6-20-05) 
Sec. 70-124. - Collection of fees. 
    The street light utility fees shall be determined by resolution of the city council. Street light utility fees shall be collected in conjunction with other city utility charges. The council may prescribe the date and manner of billing, a penalty for failure to pay within the period set for payment, and such other rules and regulations relative to the system as it may deem necessary from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 613, § 4, 6-20-05) 
Sec. 70-125. - Enforcement for collection of fees. 
    Any unpaid or delinquent street light utility fees may be recovered from the occupant or owner of the premises billed therefore in a civil action by the city in any competent jurisdiction or, in the discretion of the city council, may be certified to the county auditor as taxes against any such property to be collected and paid over to the city along with other taxes. Either or both of such methods of collection thereof may be pursued by the city until payment in full has been made and the initiation of one such method of collection shall not be deemed to be an election preventing the city from thereafter using the other method of collection until paid in full. Payment of delinquent street light utility fees shall be credited to the same fund used for current street light utility fees, deducting therefrom any costs of collection incurred by the city.

Sec. 70-151. - Findings and purposes. 
    The purpose of this Ordinance is for the efficient, economic and safe operation of a stormwater system for the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City of St. Paul Park. 
    The system, as constructed heretofore, has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. In addition to these funding sources, it is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, establishing, enlarging, replacing, repairing, maintaining, and operating the system through the imposition of fees as provided in this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 632, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 720, § 1, 10-19-15) 
Sec. 70-152. - Stormwater utility established. 
    A municipal storm water utility is hereby established and shall be operated as a public utility pursuant to M.S.A. § 444.075 from which revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of this chapter and Minnesota Statutes. The storm water utility will be part of the public works department and under the administration of the public works superintendent.

Sec. 70-153. - Definitions. 
    Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following words or phrases have the meanings given in this section. 
(1)  Lot units. A lot unit is the equivalent of ? of an acre of land. 
(2)  Runoff equivalent factor (REF). For the purposes of this section, one REF is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff generated by one lot unit of a particular land use, to the average volume of runoff generated by one lot unit of typical single-family residential land, during a standard one-year rainfall event. 
(3)  Storm water utility fees. The monthly fee charged against one lot unit having an REF of one (1.0) shall be the storm water utility fees. 
(4)  Standardized acreage. For the purpose of calculating storm water utility fees, all developed parcels shall be considered to have one lot unit, except as determined in section 70-154. 
(Ord. No. 632, § 1, 8-21-07; Ord. No. 720, § 1, 10-19-15) 
Sec. 70-154. - Calculation of fee. 
(a)  Land use classifications. 
(1)  Fees for the use and availability of the system are to be determined through the use of a "runoff equivalent factor." Storm water utility fees shall be determined by converting a parcel's total acreage into lot units. The parcel will be rounded down to the nearest ? of an acre. The resulting number of lot units is then multiplied by the storm water utility fee assigned to the land use classification for that parcel. 
(2)  The REF values and the storm water utility fees for the various land uses are as follows: 
Classification Typical Land Uses REF Quarterly Fee Amount per 
Lot Unit 1 Detached single family home* 1.0 $9.00 2 Manufactured home sites 1.0 $9.00 3 Multi family home sites 2.0 $18.00 4 Parks, cemeteries, railroads, and golf courses 0.25 $2.25 5 Churches, schools, and government buildings 2.0 $18.00 6 Commercial and industrial 3.0 $27.00 7 Unimproved-vacant As assigned  
*Existing homes on large lots with the potential for additional home sites, as determined by the public works superintendent, will be assessed a fee for each potential additional, site with a minimum area equal to the size of one lot unit. Any determination that a lot shall be assigned additional lot units is subject to the appeal process outlined in section 70-156. 
(b)  Other land uses. Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified by the city council by assigning them to the classes most nearly like the listed uses from the standpoint of impervious coverage and run-off produced.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 654, § 1, adopted February 16, 2010, repealed the former Div. 2, §§ 74-66-74-69, and enacted a new Div. 2 as set out herein. The former Div. 2 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from §§ 15.330-15.333 of the 1982 Code. 

Sec. 74-66. - Purpose and intent. 
    This division is established to provide comprehensive procedures and standards designed to allow the development of neighborhoods or portions thereof incorporating a variety of residential types and nonresidential uses, recognizing that traditional density, bulk, setbacks, use and subdivision regulations which may be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed areas may be inappropriate to control development in less developed areas. The PUD process by allowing flexibility from the strict provisions of this division related to setbacks, heights, lot area, width, depth, yards, and other equivalent performance standards by rezoning to a PUD district (or as a conditional use when applicable) is intended to encourage: 
(1)  Innovations in residential development to the end that the growing demands for housing at all economic levels may be met by greater variety in tenure, type, design, and siting of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments; 
(2)  Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects; 
(3)  More convenience in location of accessory commercial and service areas; 
(4)  The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion; 
(5)  A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses; 
(6)  An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lower housing costs and public investments; 
(7)  A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
(8)  A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the city; 
(9)  To give the landowner and developer reasonable assurance of ultimate approval before expending complete design moneys while providing city officials with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the time of concurrence; 
(10)  Provides for development reflective of the city's character including, but not limited to, tree lined streets, pedestrian elements, parks, natural resources, and street patterns; 
(11)  Provides for development consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 654, § 1, 2-16-10) 
Sec. 74-67. - General requirements and standards. 
(a)  Ownership. An application for PUD approval must be filed by the landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project. The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved final plan shall be binding on all owners. 
(b)  Comprehensive plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the city comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Sanitary sewer plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the city comprehensive sanitary sewer plan.

(e)  Operating and maintenance requirements for PUD common open space/facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are provided within the PUD, the PUD plan shall contain provisions to assure the continued operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common open space and service facilities within a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following, as approved by the city council: 
(1)  Dedicated to the public, where a community-wide use is anticipated and the city council agrees to accept the dedication. 
(2)  Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated. 
(3)  A property owners' association, provided all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  Prior to the use or occupancy or sale or the execution of contracts for sale of an individual building unit, parcel, tract, townhouse, apartment, or common area, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an equivalent document or a document such as specified by M.S.A. § 515.11 and a set of floor plans such as specified by M.S.A. § 515.13 shall be filed with the city, such filing with the city to be made prior to the filings of such declaration or document or floor plans with the recording officers of the county. 
b.  The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or equivalent document shall specify that deeds, leases or documents of conveyance affecting buildings, units, parcels, tracts, townhouses, or apartments shall subject such properties to the terms of such declaration.

The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall provide that an owners' association or corporation shall be formed and that all owners shall be members of such association or corporation which shall maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall access individual property owners' proportionate shares of joint or common costs. This declaration shall be subject to the review and approval of the city attorney. The intent of this requirement is to protect the property values of the individual owner through establishing private control. 
d.  The declaration shall additionally, among other things, provide that if the association or corporation fails to maintain properties in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the city or fails to pay taxes or assessments on properties as they become due and if the city incurs any expenses in enforcing its rules and regulations, which such expenses are not immediately reimbursed by the association or corporation, then the city shall have the right to assess each property its pro rata share of such expenses. Any such expenses shall be assessed pursuant to the provisions of M.S.A. § 429.101, as amended. 
e.  Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer.

When a PUD provides for common or public open space, the total area of common or public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD. 
(g)  Density. The maximum allowable density in a PUD shall be determined by reference to the comprehensive plan. Within that limit, the exact density allowable shall be determined by standards agreed upon between the applicant and the city. Whenever any PUD is to be developed in stages, no such stage shall, when averaged with all previously completed stages, have a residential density that exceeds 125 percent of the proposed residential density of the entire PUD. 
(h)  Utilities. In any PUD, all utilities, including telephone, electricity, gas and telecable, shall be installed underground. 
(i)  Utility connections. 
(1)  Water connections. Where more than one property in a PUD is served from the same service line, a shutoff valve must be located in such a way that each unit's service may be shut off by the city, in addition to the normally supplied shutoff at the street. 
(2)  Sewer connections. Where more than one unit in a PUD is served by a sanitary sewer lateral which exceeds 300 feet in length, provision must be made for a manhole to allow adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All maintenance and cleaning shall be the responsibility of the property owners' association or owner.

(k)  Landscaping. In any PUD, landscaping shall be provided according to a plan approved by the city council, which shall include a detailed planting list with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plan. In assessing the landscaping plan, the city council shall consider the natural features of the particular site, the architectural characteristics of the proposed structures and the overall scheme of the PUD plan, including: 
(1)  The use of vegetation in and around parking lots to provide shade and visual relief. 
(2)  Landscaped buffer areas shall be provided between varying residential densities to provide a transition from one type of housing to another. 
(l)  Urban development and availability of public services. All development in the PUD will be carefully phased so as to ensure that all developable land will be accorded a present vested right to develop at such time as services and facilities are available. Lands which have the necessary available municipal facilities and services will be granted approval in accordance with existing ordinances and development techniques. Lands which lack the available facilities and services will be granted approval for development at such times as the facilities and services have been made available by the continuing public improvement program or at such time when the developer agrees to furnish such facilities or improvements put forth by the city or other public agency. 
(1)  Variances. If it can be demonstrated by the petitioner that divergence from the points in this subsection (l) will not cause an unreasonable burden upon the city in providing services and utilities or cause a deleterious impact upon the natural environment, then the city council may consider granting a variance to this policy in reviewing a proposed development. 
(2)  Water and sewer facilities. No major PUD will be permitted in areas not having city water and sanitary sewer available within a reasonable length of time from the date of PUD approval. 
(m)  Townhouse and quadraminiums. In any PUD:

(2)  No building in the PUD shall be located less than 15 feet from the back of the curb line along those roadways which are part of the internal street pattern. 
(3)  No building within the PUD project shall be nearer to another building than one-half the sum of the building heights of the two buildings. 
(o)  General building and site design. 
(1)  The design shall consider the whole of the project and shall create a unified environment within the boundaries of the project by ensuring architectural compatibility of all structures, efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, aesthetically pleasing landscape and site features, and efficient use and design of utilities. 
(2)  Buildings should address the street with varied and articulated facades, frequent entries and windows. Porches and balconies should be encouraged, and facades consisting of long blank walls or series of garage doors are prohibited. 
(3)  The design of a PUD shall optimize compatibility between the project and surrounding land uses, both existing and proposed and shall minimize the potential adverse impacts of the PUD on surrounding land uses and the potential adverse effects of the surrounding land uses on the PUD. 
(4)  If a project for which a PUD treatment has been requested involves construction over a period of time in two or more phases, the applicant shall demonstrate that each phase is capable of addressing and meeting each of the criteria independent of the other phases. 
(p)  PUD Benefit. The proposed PUD shall accomplish the goals, policies, and requirements established in the purpose and intent and the general requirements and standards in this ordinance and shall not simply be for the enhanced economic gain of the applicant. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate compliance with this requirement and provide specific written documentation addressing this matter as part of the PUD zoning application. Based on this documentation, the city shall determine that some benefit will be realized by the city if a PUD is permitted.

h.  The applicant or a representative thereof shall appear before the planning commission in order to answer questions concerning the proposed development. 
i.  The planning commission shall review the development stage PUD plan to consider the conformity of the plan to the comprehensive plan, with respect to the merit or lack of merit of any departure of the development stage plan from substantial conformity with the concept PUD plan and with respect to the compliance of the development stage PUD plan with the provisions of this division, with findings related to the relevant elements of the purpose statement of the PUD ordinance, and all other applicable federal, state and local codes. 
j.  Within 30 days of receipt of the report and recommendation of the planning commission, the council shall grant approval, resubmit the plan to the planning commission for further consideration of specified items, or deny approval of the plan setting forth its findings of fact and conditions in the form of a resolution. 
(5)  Limitation on detailed plan approval. Unless a final plan covering the area designated in the development stage plan as the first stage of the PUD has been filed within six months from the date the council grants development stage plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file final plans and to proceed with the development in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and/or an approved development stage plan, the approval shall expire. Upon application by the applicant, the council at its discretion may extend, for not more than six months, the filing deadline for any final plan when, for good cause shown, such extension is necessary. In any case where development plan approval expires, the council shall forthwith adopt a resolution repealing the general concept plan approval and the development stage plan approval for that portion of the PUD that has not received final plan approval and reestablishing the zoning and other ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable. 
(6)  Site improvements. At any time following the approval of a development stage plan by the council, the applicant may, pursuant to the applicable ordinances of the city, apply for, and the city public works supervisor may issue, grading permits for the area within the PUD for which development stage plan approval has been given. 
(d)  Final plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The final plan is to serve as a complete, thorough and permanent public record of the PUD and the manner in which it is to be developed. It shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved modifications thereof resulting from the PUD process. It shall serve in conjunction with other city ordinances as the land use regulation applicable to the PUD. The final plan is intended only to add detail to, and to put in final form the information contained in the general concept plan and the development stage plan and shall conform to the development stage plan in all respects. 
(2)  Schedule. Upon approval of the development stage plan, and within the time established by subsection (c)(5) of this section, the applicant shall file with the city administrator a final plan consisting of the information and submissions required by section 74-68 for the entire PUD or for one or more stages. This application will be considered at the next possible regular planning commission meetings.

b.  Within 30 days of receipt of the findings and recommendations of the planning commission, the council shall grant approval or denial of such request. 
(3)  Final action. The final action of the city council to approve, deny or conditionally approve the final plan shall be in the form of a resolution setting forth facts and findings and conditions of approval. 
(4)  Denial. Denial of the final plan PUD shall be accompanied by written findings of fact of the city council including supporting data setting forth the reasons for the denial in terms of the ways the proposed use fails to meet the standards and intent of the comprehensive plan, is not consistent with the approved development stage PUD plan and/or concept PUD plan and/or is otherwise injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(5)  Zoning enactment. A rezoning of a parcel of land to PUD shall not become effective until such time as the city council approves an ordinance reflecting said amendment, which shall take place at the time the city council approves the final plan PUD and final plat. Upon approval of the Final Plan PUD and final plat, all ordinances for rezoning shall be published to implement the PUD zone. 
(6)  PUD agreement. The terms of the PUD as approved by the city council shall be embodied in a PUD agreement/development contract, and such other documents as the city shall deem necessary or desirable. 
(7)  Recording. Within 90 days of its approval, the applicant shall cause the final plan, PUD agreement/development agreements, covenants and all other pertinent documents to be recorded with the county recorder or registrar of deeds, at the expense of the applicant. Certified copies of said recorded documents shall be furnished to the city as evidence that the documents have been filed. 
(8)  Issuance of building and other permits. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, upon receiving notice from the building official that the approved final plan has been recorded and upon application of the applicant pursuant to the applicable ordinances of the city, all appropriate officials of the city may issue building and other permits to the applicant for development, construction and other work in the area encompassed by the approved final plan provided, however, that no such permit shall be issued unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of all codes and ordinances which are applicable to the permit sought have been satisfied. 
(9)  Limitation on final plan approval. Within one year after the approval of a final plan for PUD, or such shorter time as may be established by the approved development schedule, construction shall commence in accordance with such approved plan. Failure to commence construction within such period shall, unless an extension shall have been granted as provided in this section, automatically render void the PUD permit and all approvals of the PUD plan and the area encompassed within the PUD shall thereafter be subject to those provisions of the zoning ordinances, and other ordinances, applicable in the district in which it is located. In such case, the council shall forthwith adopt an ordinance repealing the PUD permit and all PUD approvals and reestablishing the zoning and other ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable. The time limit established by this subsection may, at the discretion of the council, be extended for not more than one year by ordinance or resolution duly adopted. 
(10)  Inspections during development. Following final plan approval of a PUD, or a stage thereof, the city administrator shall, at least annually until the completion of development, review all permits issued and construction undertaken and compare actual development with the approved development schedule. 
(11)  Compliance with overall plan. If the city administrator finds that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the PUD plans as finally approved, he shall immediately notify the council.

(1)  The proposed action has been considered in relation to the specific policies and provisions of and has been found to be consistent with the official city comprehensive land use plan. 
(2)  The proposed use is or will be compatible with present and future land uses of the area. 
(3)  The proposed use conforms with all performance standards contained in this article. 
(4)  The proposed use will not tend to or actually depreciate the area in which it is proposed. 
(5)  The proposed use can be accommodated with existing public services and will not overburden the city's service capacity. 
(f)  The planning commission and city staff shall have the authority to request additional information from the applicant concerning operational factors or to retain expert testimony with the consent and at the expense of the applicant concerning operational factors, such information to be declared necessary to establish performance conditions in relation to all pertinent sections of this chapter.

(k)  If, upon receiving the reports and recommendations of the planning commission and city staff, the city council finds that specific inconsistencies exist in the review process and thus the final recommendation of the city council will differ from that of the planning commission, the city council may, before taking final action, refer the matter back to the planning commission for further consideration. The city council shall provide the planning commission with a written statement detailing the specific reasons for referral. This procedure shall be followed only once for each application. 
(l)  Approval of a request for an amendment, conditional use permit, or interim use permit shall require passage by a four-fifths vote of the entire city council.

(c)  Lapse of conditional use permit by non-use. Whenever within one year after the granting of a conditional use permit, the use as permitted by the permit shall not have been completed or utilized, then such permit shall become null and void unless a petition for an extension of time in which to complete or utilize the use has been granted by the city council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the building official at least 30 days before the expiration of the original conditional use permit. There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete or utilize the use permitted in the conditional use permit.

Except in the case of non-income-producing residential property, upon approval of a conditional use permit, the city shall be provided with a surety bond, cash escrow, certificate of deposit, securities or cash deposit prior to the issuing of building permits or initiation of work on the proposed improvements or development. Such security shall be non-cancellable and shall guarantee conformance and compliance with the conditions of the conditional use permit and the ordinances of the city. 
(1)  The security shall be in the amount of one and one-half times the city administrator's or city building official's estimated costs of labor and materials for the proposed improvements or development. Such project can be handled in stages upon the discretion of the city administrator and building official. 
(2)  The city shall hold the security until completion of the proposed improvements or development and a certificate of occupancy indicating compliance with the conditional use permit and ordinances of the city has been issued by the city building official. 
(3)  Failure to comply with the conditions of the conditional use permit or the ordinances of the city shall result in forfeiture of the security. 
(f)  Revocation. The planning commission may recommend, and the city council may direct, the revocation of any conditional use permit for cause upon determination that the authorized conditional use is not in conformance with the conditions of the permit or is in continued violation of this division, City Codes, or other applicable regulations. The city council or planning commission shall initiate an application and the city administrator shall notify the responsible person that they have an opportunity to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. The application shall be processed and considered pursuant to the procedure set forth for processing conditional use permits by this section. The city administrator shall provide the applicant a copy of the proceedings and findings of the planning commission and city council. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 1, 6-21-10) 
Sec. 74-94. - Interim use permits. 
    Interim use permits may be granted by the city council where allowed by zoning district, subject to the same process as required for conditional use permits under this chapter. Each interim use permit shall include a requirement for a recordable development contract between the city and the owner and applicant which specifies the date and/or conditions for termination of the interim use permit. Said development contract shall be executed prior to any building, grading, or other permit may be issued to the project. The use allowed by the interim use permit shall terminate on or before the termination period listed in the development contract and council resolution, and no extension may be granted. Continuation of the use may be allowed only by issuance of a new interim use permit under the terms of this chapter. The owner and applicant shall expressly agree and acknowledge that neither the grant of an interim use permit, nor the improvements made pursuant to such permit, shall confer any right or preference to a subsequent permit for the same or similar use in the future.

    The costs of the city for receiving, analyzing, processing, hearing and final process for requests of changes, modification, or special consideration under this division, such as requests for amendments (map or text), site and building plan reviews, conditional use permits, interim use permits, and variances are considered to be unique to the applicant requesting such consideration, and it is the intent of this section to provide that all costs of the city occasioned by such requests shall be borne by the applicant. The reimbursement to the city shall be limited to actual costs of the city. Actual costs shall include all engineering, legal, planning, or other consultant fees or costs paid by the city for other consultants for expert review of a development application. 
(a)  Base zoning fee. To defray administrative costs of processing of requests for conditional uses, interim use permits, amendments, variances, appeals, or any other land use or zoning permit applications, a base fee as set by chapter 42 of the City Code per application shall be paid by all applicants. Each applicant shall pay a nonrefundable base zoning fee at the time an application is presented to the city for a zoning change of any nature, site and building plan review, a conditional use, an interim use, or a variance. This fee is intended to reimburse the city for its costs for administrative processing a development application. If this fee proves to be insufficient to cover such costs, such additional costs will be charged as a part of the zoning deposit, or the supplemental zoning deposit. 
(b)  Escrow deposit. In addition to the nonrefundable base zoning fee, each applicant shall pay an escrow deposit in an amount established by city council on the fee schedule at the time of application.

The one or more supplemental deposits shall be in an amount sufficient to pay all actual costs of the city. 
(d)  Refunds-Administrative costs. The base zoning fee, intended to cover administrative costs, is nonrefundable. 
(e)  Refunds-Direct costs. If the direct costs of the city in processing the application are less than the amount of the escrow deposit and any supplemental deposit, any such unexpended amount shall be refunded to the applicant upon the conclusion of the proceedings, and any such costs in excess of the supplemental deposits on hand with the city shall be paid by the applicant prior to completion of the proceedings by the city. 
F.  Assessment. In order to recoup the additional cost of processing zoning applications, the city shall have the option of assessing all applicants the total excess cost of staff and/or consulting time spent exclusively in review, consideration, research, or production of materials for the applicant's request, and all materials for such request not covered by the application fee or other collections.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 663, § 2, adopted October 18, 2010, repealed the former Art. III, §§ 74-191, 74-192, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from § 15.050, 15.051 of the 1982 Code. 

Sec. 74-191. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained. The zoning ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that nonconforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of this article that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity. 
(Ord. No. 663, § 2, 10-18-10) 
Sec. 74-192. - Regulations governing nonconformities generally. 
(a)  Any structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter shall not be enlarged but may be continued at the size and in the manner of operation existing upon such date except as specified in this article, as amended. 
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when such structure is declared unsafe by the building official, provided the necessary repairs shall not constitute more than 50 percent of fair market value of such structure. Such value shall be determined by the building official. 
(c)  No nonconforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which such building, structure or use was constructed or was conducted at the time of this chapter's adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

Provided, however, that any repainting, cleaning, and other normal maintenance or repair of the sign or sign structure shall not modify the sign structure or copy in any way which makes it more nonconforming or the sign shall lose its legal nonconforming status.

(b)  Motor fuel station. Signs for motor fuel stations shall be regulated by the single occupancy business structure sign provisions for the zoning district in which the station is located.

Such plan shall be subject to the review of the planning commission and approval of the city council. No permit shall be issued for an individual use except upon a determination that it is consistent with the approved comprehensive sign plan. The effect of such comprehensive sign plan is to allow and require the owner of a multiple occupancy structure to determine the specific individual sign requirements for the tenants of his structure. As sign locations and size, etc. may be of significant importance in lease arrangements between owner and tenant, it is the city's intention to establish general requirements for negotiation by the owner with his individual tenants on their specific sign needs.

(4)  In any multiple occupancy structure qualifying as a shopping center, directory signs shall be permitted for each common public entrance. Each directory sign area shall not exceed a total of 50 square feet and shall be located within 50 feet of the common public entrance being served. The size of individual business identification signing within the directory shall be resolved during the site plan review process. Attention shall be given to the possible number of tenant or occupant bays which may be served by the common public entrance for which the directory sign is intended. 
(e)  Industrial uses covering more than 40 acres of land. Where industrial uses cover more than 40 acres of land, two area identification signs may be displayed in accordance with the maximum sign size provisions per area identification sign of the applicable zoning district.

(b)  Inspection. All signs for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the city administrator. The city administrator, or his designated agent, is hereby authorized to enter upon any property or premises to ascertain whether the provisions of this article are being obeyed. Such entrance shall be made during business hours unless an emergency exists. The administrator may order the removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with the maintenance provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 653, § 2, 2-16-10) 
Sec. 74-329. - Application, permit and variance procedures.

If it shall appear that the proposed structure is in compliance with all the requirements of this article and all other laws and ordinances of the city, the permit shall then be issued. If the work authorized under a permit has not been completed within 60 days after the date of issuance, the permit shall be null and void. 
(c)  Variances. In order to provide additional flexibility in the enforcement of this article and to alleviate hardship and injustice, the city council, serving as the board of adjustment and appeals, may, upon application, grant a variation from the terms of this article. Upon application from the person seeking a permit for the erection or installation of a sign, the request for variance shall be processed in accordance with applicable provisions of sections 74-121 through 74-124.

1.  All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as conditional uses which, acting alone or in combination with existing or anticipated future uses, unduly affect the capacity of the floodway or unduly increase flood heights. Consideration of the effects of a proposed use shall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment extending for a significant reach on both sides of the stream. All conditional use applications shall be accompanied by a floodway impact statement drafted by a registered engineer. The city administrator shall be responsible for submitting the proposal and application to the department of natural resources and any other governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area for review and written comment. 
2.  Fill. 
i.  Any fill proposed to be deposited in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial purpose and the amount thereof must not exceed that necessary to achieve the intended purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing the uses to which the filled land will be put and the final dimensions of the proposed fill or other materials. 
ii.  Such fill or other materials shall be protected against erosion by riprap, vegetative cover, or bulkheading. 
3.  Structures (temporary and permanent). 
i.  Structures shall not be designated for human habitation. 
ii.  Structures shall have a low flood damage potential. 
iii.  The structure or structures, if allowed, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters. Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow and, so far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow as the adjoining structures. 
iv.  Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures and/or restriction of bridge openings and other narrow sections of the stream or river. 
v.  Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be installed at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or floodproofed. 
4.  Storage of material and equipment. 
i.  The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. 
ii.  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or shall be readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
5.  Garbage and solid waste disposal. 
i.  No conditional use permits for garbage and waste disposal sites shall be issued for floodway areas. 
ii.  Provided, further, there shall be no further encroachment upon the floodway at existing sites. 
6.  Structural works for flood control. Structural works for flood control such as dams, levees, dikes, and floodwalls shall be allowed only upon issuance of a conditional use permit. In addition, any proposed work in the beds of public waters which will change the course, current or cross section of the waters shall be subject to the provisions of M.S.A. ch. 105 and other applicable statutes. 
(2)  Flood fringe. 
a.  Uses allowed within the floodway. 
b.  Conditional uses as allowed and limited to conditions imposed by all districts which jointly apply plus as may be modified in this section. 
1.  Residential uses. Residences shall be constructed on fill with the first floor or basement floor at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation shall be no more than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area and shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any structure or building erected thereon. Where existing streets or utilities are at elevations which make compliance with this provision impractical, or in other special circumstances, the city engineer may authorize other techniques for protection. 
2.  Nonresidential uses. Structures other than residences shall ordinarily be elevated on fill as provided in subsection (2)b.1 of this section but may, in special circumstances subject to the city engineer's approval, be protected to a point at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
3.  Business uses. Commercial structures generally must be constructed on fill with no first floor or basement floor constructed below the flood protection elevation. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots, may be at lower elevations. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the general public shall not be granted, in the absence of a flood warning system, if the area is inundated to a depth greater than two feet or subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon the occurrence of a regional flood. 
4.  Manufacturing and industrial uses. Manufacturing and industrial buildings, structures and appurtenant works shall be protected to the flood protection elevation. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plan operations especially for streams having protracted flood durations. Certain necessary land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in subsection (2)b.3 of this section. In considering permit applications, the city administrator shall give due consideration to the needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
5.  Utilities, railroad tracks, streets and bridges. Public utility facilities, roads, railroad tracks, and bridges within the floodplain shall be designed to minimize increases in flood elevations and shall be compatible with local comprehensive floodplain development plans. Protection to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of the public facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Where failure or interruption of service would not endanger life or health, a lesser degree of protection may be provided for minor or auxiliary roads, railroads, or utilities. 
6.  Waste treatment and waste disposal. 
i.  No new construction, addition, or modification to existing waste treatment facilities shall be permitted within the floodplain unless emergency plans and procedures for action to be taken in the event of flooding are prepared, filed with and approved by the state pollution control agency. The emergency plans and procedures must provide for measures to prevent introduction of any pollutant or toxic material into the floodwaters. 
ii.  There shall be no disposal of garbage or solid waste materials within floodplain areas except upon issuance of a conditional use permit at sites approved by the state pollution control agency and subject to the requirements of section 74-91 et seq. 
7.  Flood control works. Flood control works shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (1)b.6 of this section. 
i.  The minimum height and design of any dikes, levees, floodwalls, or similar structural works shall be based upon the flood profile of the regional flood defined between the structures, subject to the following: 
For urban areas, the minimum height and design of structural works shall be at least three feet above the elevation of the regional flood or at the elevation of the standard project flood, whichever is greater. 
Modifications and additions to existing structural works shall assure that the work will provide a means of decreasing the flood damage potential in the area. Any existing structural work which potentially threatens public health or safety shall be modified or reconstructed in order to meet the standards contained in this section within a period of one year of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
ii.  Flood protection elevations and floodway limits which reflect proposed measures for flood control shall not be effective until such measures are constructed and operative unless the proposed measures will increase flood heights, in which event the regulatory flood protection elevations and floodplain limits shall reflect the anticipated increases. 
iii.  Detailed plans shall be submitted to the city administrator for any new developments placed on the floodplain landward from dikes and levees. The plans must provide for ponding areas or other measures to protect against flooding from internal drainage. 
(Code 1982, § 15.329) 
Sec. 74-871. - Procedures and standards for evaluating proposed conditional uses. 
(a)  Information required. Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a use within the floodplain district, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is in the floodway or the flood fringe area: 
(1)  A typical valley cross section showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 
(2)  Plan (surface view) showing the nature, locations, dimensions, and elevation of the lot, contours of the ground, fill; storage of materials; floodproofing measures; the arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site; locations and elevations of streets; existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream; soil type, and the relationship of the above to the location of the channel. 
(3)  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
(b)  Methods used to analyze flood hazard. Information consistent with standards established by the state department of natural resources shall be used to delineate the general floodplain district. The city administrator shall, where applicable: 
(1)  Estimate the discharge of the regional flood which is representative of large floods which are known to have occurred in this region and which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular stream subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to occur on the average of once every 100 years. 
(2)  Determine the specific flooding threat at the site of the proposed conditional use and determine whether the use is located in a floodway or flood fringe area by: 
a.  Calculation of water surface elevations and flood protection elevations based upon a hydraulic analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. Flood protection elevations shall be one foot above the water surface elevations of the regional flood plus the increase in flood heights caused by the proposed development as provided in subsection (b)(2)b of this section. 
b.  Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights to an extent which would cause substantial upstream or downstream damage to existing or reasonably anticipated future development. Computation of increases in flood heights caused by any encroachment shall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of encroachment of both sides of the stream within that reach. Generally, an increase in flood stages attributable to encroachments on the floodplain of any river or stream shall not exceed 0.5 foot in any one reach or for the cumulative effect of several reaches. 
(3)  Evaluate the effects of the proposed use upon the public health, safety and general welfare in light of the purposes of this chapter and the standards established in this chapter and recommend to the planning commission and city council to deny, grant, or conditionally grant the application for the proposed use, based upon established administrative procedures of this chapter as may be applicable. 
(c)  Supplementary considerations. In acting upon the conditional use application, the city council shall consider all relevant factors specified in section 74-91 et seq., in addition to the following: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
(3)  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
(4)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(5)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(6)  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
(7)  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
(10)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site. 
(12)  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter. 
(d)  Conditions attached to conditional use permits. Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities. 
(2)  Limitations on periods of use, occupancy, and operation. 
(3)  Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions. 
(4)  Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other protective measures. 
(5)  Floodproofing measures in accordance with the state building code. The applicant shall submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.

Sec. 74-901. - Purpose and intent. 
    In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and business while protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the community, the council finds that these regulations are necessary in order to establish predictable and balanced regulations for the siting and screening of wireless communications equipment while protecting the public against any adverse impacts on the city's aesthetic resources and the public welfare. 
    Goals in adopting this division are as follows: 
(1)  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards; 
(2)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; 
(3)  Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community; 
(4)  Utilization of public land, buildings and structures for wireless communications whenever possible; 
(5)  The purpose on land outside the MUSA (Metropolitan Urban Services Area) priority will be to site freestanding towers on property identified on the comprehensive plan as open space or along proposed trail routes; 
(6)  Require monopoles be designed to accommodate at least two separate users; 
(7)  Freestanding monopoles shall be designed to encourage co-location of facilities on the same structure or on the same site; 
(8)  When selecting freestanding sites, the following preferences shall be followed: 
Primary land use areas for monopoles as special use permits. 
   Industrial. 
   Freeway development corridors in nonresidential areas, 1,000 feet from edge of 
 freeway right-of-way to the monopole. 
   Institution/public land or structures.

   Parking lots may be used to locate monopoles where the monopole replicates, 
 incorporates or substantially blends with the overall lighting standards of the parking 
 lot. 
   Private open space as designated on the comprehensive plan. 
Secondary land use areas for monopoles as special use permits. 
   Residential areas within the MUSA meeting requirements of this division and on five 
 acre parcels or larger. 
   Non-identified land use areas within the Metropolitan Urban Service Area as the principal 
 land use in excess of five acres. 
Secondary land use areas for monopoles as interim special use permits. 
   Rural un-sewered areas 
Primary structural location preference for wireless communication equipment as permitted uses.
