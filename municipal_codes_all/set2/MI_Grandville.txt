PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of the City of Grandville, Michigan of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Compiled Ordinances and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Compiled Ordinances, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Editor-in-Chief, and Linda Davis, Code Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Randall Kraker, Assistant City Attorney, and Ms. Sharon Streelman, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-30. - Municipal ordinance violations bureau. 
(a)	Bureau established. The city hereby establishes a municipal ordinance violations bureau ("bureau") as authorized under section 8396 of the act to accept admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions in response to municipal civil infraction violation notices issued and served by authorized city officials, and to collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by this Code or any ordinance. 
(b)	Location; supervision; employees; rules and regulations. The bureau shall be located at Grandville City Hall, and shall be under the supervision and control of the city manager or his designee. The city manager, subject to the approval of the city council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of the bureau and appoint any necessary qualified city employees to administer the bureau. 
(c)	Disposition of violations. The bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the bureau. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or restrict the city from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)	Bureau limited to accepting admissions of responsibility. The scope of the bureau's authority shall be limited to accepting admissions of responsibility for municipal civil infractions and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of those admissions. The bureau shall not accept payment of a fine from any person who denies having committed the offense or who admits responsibility only with explanation, and in no event shall the bureau determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or matter relating to an alleged violation. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil infraction violation at the bureau and may have the violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection accorded by law. 
(e)	Municipal civil infraction violation notices. Municipal civil infraction violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized city officials under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided for citations as provided in sections 1-28(f) and (g) of this chapter. In addition to any other information required by this Code or other ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the alleged violator must appear at the bureau, the methods by which an appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the bureau, the hours during which the bureau is open, the amount of the fine scheduled for the alleged violation, and the consequences for failure to appear and pay the required fine within the required time. 
(f)	Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the bureau and pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person, or by representation. 
(g)	Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid. If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the violation are not paid at the bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by first-class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by sections 8705 and 8709 of the act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation. 
(Ord. No. 208, § 5, eff. 12-4-94) 
Sec. 1-31. - Schedule of civil fines established. 
(a)	A schedule of civil fines payable to the bureau for admissions of responsibility by persons served with municipal ordinance violation notices is hereby established. 
(b)	A copy of the schedule, as amended from time to time, shall be posted at the bureau.

(4)	When the council determines a public interest will best be served by purchase from or joint purchase with another unit of government.

In the event of such emergency purchases, the city manager shall report the details of the purchase to the city council at its next regular meeting. 
    In the event of an emergency, the city council may enter into a contract or purchase exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) without competitive bidding. The nature of the emergency shall be set forth in full in the council minutes.

    Should the city council determine that additional construction needs to be undertaken as part of, or in conjunction with, an already awarded construction contract, it may authorized a contract or change order for such additional work with the original contractor, and without the necessity of putting the additional work out for competitive bidding, if: 
(1)	The price of the additional work does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the original contract price; or

The cable operator shall file ten (10) copies of the schedule or proposed increase with the city clerk. For purposes of this chapter, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten (10) copies have been received by the city clerk. The city council may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the information, data and calculations which must be included as part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed increase. 
(b)	In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations of the city pursuant to section 6.5-4(1) above, a cable operator shall provide all information requested by the manager in connection with the city's review and regulation of existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in these rates.

If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to it; or (2) the cable operator may seek review within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review.

The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

These variances, to be known and entitled noise variances, shall exclude the event, activity or location for which the permit is issued from the operation and requirements of this chapter, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(c)	Any person seeking a variance pursuant to this section shall file an application with the city clerk on a form prescribed by the city manager. The application shall contain, in addition to such information as shall be required by the city manager, information demonstrating that bringing the source of sound for which the variance is sought or the activity involved into compliance with this chapter, would cause an unreasonable hardship for the applicant, with consideration of the factors outlined in subsection (f) of this section. Upon receiving such an application, the clerk shall submit it to the city manager. Upon receipt of an application, the city manager shall cause such investigation as he deems necessary to be made concerning the application. This investigation may include but need not be limited to consultation with such city departments as he may deem necessary or desirable. The city manager, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section may, in his discretion, cause a public hearing to be held on any application for a noise variance. If no public hearing is held, the city manager, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, shall allow interested parties to submit written comments concerning an application for a noise variance. The applicant shall, prior to the investigation of the application by the city manager, cause a public notice of the application for a noise variance to be published at least once in a weekly newspaper of general circulation published in the city in a form prescribed by the city manager. 
(d)	The city manager, in addition to such other investigation as he may deem necessary:
(1)	Shall require the applicant to show that the notice requirements provided for in this section have been met; 
(2)	Shall permit the applicant to offer such evidence as he desires to establish the applicant's position that a variance should be granted; 
(3)	Shall permit those opposing the applicant's request for a variance to offer evidence in opposition to the granting of a variance; 
(4)	May, in his discretion, refuse to receive or hear evidence that is merely cumulative, and may reasonably limit the time allowed to present evidence by those supporting and those opposing the application. 
(e)	The city manager shall consider all evidence received pursuant to this section and based upon this evidence and the results of his investigation, shall make a recommendation to the city council as to whether a noise variance should be granted. The city manager shall make his recommendation based upon the factors set out in subsection (f) of this section, and shall state the reasons for his recommendation in writing. The application and the recommendation of the city manager shall be placed on the agenda of the city council and shall be considered in due course according to the rules of the city council. In deciding whether to grant the noise variance, the city council shall consider the factors set out in subsection (f) of this section. The city council shall, by resolution, grant or deny the variance. If a resolution approving a noise variance is passed, the city clerk shall issue a noise variance subject to the terms of this section. 
(f)	The following factors shall be considered in determining whether to grant the variance:
(1)	The balance of the hardship to the applicant, the community and other persons in not granting the variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons adversely affected and any other adverse effects of the granting of the variance; 
(2)	The number, if any, of previous variances granted to the applicant, for the same location or activity; 
(3)	The nearness of any residence or any other use which would be adversely affected by noise in excess of the limits prescribed by this chapter; 
(4)	The sound level of the sound to be generated by the event or activity;
(5)	Whether the type of noise to be produced by the event is usual or unusual for the location or area for which the variance is requested; 
(6)	The density of population of the area in which the event or activity is to take place;
(7)	The time of day or night during which the activity or event will take place;
(8)	The nature of the sound to be produced including but not limited to whether the sound will be steady, intermittent or of a repetitive impulse nature. 
(g)	Neither the city manager nor the city council shall consider the communicative content of the activity or event in determining whether to grant or deny a variance. The rights of all interested persons to due process of law and equal protection of law shall not be denied. 
(h)	Variances shall only be granted subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The event or activity for which the permit is sought shall be held in a public place.
(2)	The event or activity for which the permit is sought shall be open to the public. There shall be no discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin or sex. 
(3)	Variances issued shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as the city council shall require including but not limited to the following: 
a.	Limiting the days of the week for which the variance is valid;
b.	Limiting the number of days for which the variance is valid;
c.	Limiting the hours of the day for which the variance is valid;
Such conditions shall be noted on the variance issued to the applicant and noncompliance with any condition of the variance shall terminate the variance and subject the applicant, event or activity to the provisions of this chapter. The variance shall not be valid unless all conditions thereof are agreed to by the applicant or his duly authorized officer or agent, in writing. 
(i)	Any variance issued pursuant to this section shall be kept at the site of the event or activity for which the variance was obtained. The variance shall be displayed, on request, to any law enforcement officer. The requirements of this subsection are hereby made express conditions of the granting of the variance and failure to comply with these conditions shall cause the variance to terminate as provided for in subsection (h) of this section. 
(j)	The city council, in granting or denying a variance pursuant to this section, shall be an administrative body acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, subject to review as provided in Article 6, Section 28, of the Michigan Constitution of 1963.

(c)	Adult responsibility. 
(1)	No adult having control of any residence or premises shall allow an open house party to take place at the residence or premises if any alcoholic beverage or drugs are possessed or consumed at the residence or premises by any minor where the adult knew or reasonably should have known that any alcoholic beverage or drug was in the possession of or being consumed by a minor at such residence or premises, and where the adult failed to take responsible steps to prevent the possession of consumption of the alcoholic beverage or drug at the residence or premises. For purposes of this subsection, reasonable knowledge will be presumed to exist if the adult received documented notice from the city in the previous one hundred eighty (180) days concerning a purported violation of this subsection. 
(2)	No adult having control of any residence or premises shall allow an open house party to take place at the residence or premises that becomes so large or loud so as to disrupt the peace and dignity of the neighboring residences or premises, where the adult in control of the residence or premises knew or should have known that the house party was disturbing the neighboring residences or premises.

Sec. 22-9. - Lien, notice, payment without penalty, installments, collections. 
(a)	All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall from the date of confirmation of such roll constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created by the city Charter for city taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the city council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon. All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the special assessment roll or in annual installments not to exceed fifteen (15) in number as the city council may determine at the time of confirmation and if in annual installments, the city council shall determine the first installment to be due upon confirmation or on the following July first and subsequent installments on July first of succeeding years. 
(b)	The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the city clerk to the city treasurer for collection immediately after its confirmation. The city treasurer shall mail statements of the several assessments to the respective owners, as indicated by the records of the city assessor, of the several lots and parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid; provided, however, that failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay the assessment. 
(c)	The whole or any part of any such special assessment may be paid without interest or penalty after the date of confirmation on the special assessment roll and before the following April first or such other date as shall be set by the city council when the roll is confirmed. Not later than fifteen (15) days after the end of the period, the city treasurer shall transmit such roll to the city assessor with all payments upon assessments noted thereon. The city assessor shall then divide any remaining balance of each assessment into such number of equal installments as shall have been fixed by the city council; provided, that if such division operates to make any installment less than ten dollars ($10.00), then the city assessor shall reduce the number of installments so that each installment shall be above and as near to ten dollars ($10.00) as possible. 
(d)	The first installment shall be spread upon the next city tax roll in a column headed "Special Assessments," together with interest upon all unpaid installments from the date set by the city council as provided in subsection (c) of this section to the first day of July of the year in which such tax roll is made; provided, that any fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month. Thereafter one (1) installment shall be spread upon each annual tax roll, together with one (1) year's interest upon all unpaid installments; provided, that when any annual installment shall have been prepaid as provided in subsection (f) of this section, then there shall be spread upon the tax roll for such year only the interest upon all unpaid installments. 
(e)	After each installment has been placed on the tax rolls, the same shall be collected by the city treasurer, or other person designated by law, with the same rights and remedies and the same penalties and interest as provided in the Charter for the collection of taxes. 
(f)	After the expiration of the period provided for in subsection (c) of this section, any installment which has not been spread upon the tax rolls may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof plus interest thereon to date of payment. Any person desiring to pay such installment in advance shall first secure the proper statement from the city assessor to permit the city treasurer to compute the amount to be paid. The city treasurer shall report to the city assessor all advance payments on installments so that the city assessor shall have such information before spreading installments on the next city tax roll.

(Ord. No. 75, eff. 4-16-59; Comp. Ords. 1977, § 17.070) 
Sec. 22-11. - Deficiency in assessments. 
    Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount assessed to the city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the city council shall make additional assessments against the city and the several lots and parcels of land, in the same ratio as the original assessments, to supply the deficiency; but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement, provided that the additional pro rata assessment shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the assessment as originally confirmed unless a meeting of the city council is held to review such additional assessment. Notices for such meeting shall be mailed as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. 75, eff. 4-16-59; Comp. Ords. 1977, § 17.071) 
Sec. 22-12. - Excess of assessments. 
    The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is five (5) percent, or less of the assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than five (5) percent the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent such installments then exist and the balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by such special assessment. 
(Ord. No. 75, eff. 4-16-59; Comp. Ords. 1977, § 17.072) 
Sec. 22-13. - Deferred payments. 
(a)	If in the opinion of the city assessor and the city council any person holding property subject to special assessment is unable to contribute toward the cost thereof by reason of poverty, payment of such special assessment or any part thereof may be resolution of the city council be deferred until the death of such person or until such person transfers any part or all of his interest in such property. At such time any deferred payments of the special assessment shall become due and payable together with any and all interest accrued thereon to such time. While payment is so deferred, interest on the amount of the special assessment shall accrue and be added to the amount of the deferred special assessment. 
(b)	If property subject to special assessment is only partially used for residential purposes or is entirely undeveloped or unplatted, the city council may by resolution defer payment of the special assessment levied against part or all of such property. Deferment of the payment of special assessments in such case may be permitted until such time as the premises are developed or platted or, in the case of water or sewer services, until such services are connected to any part of the premises for which payment was deferred. At such time, the entire amount of the special assessment against the area so developed, platted or connected with sewer or water services shall become due and payable. If there is no such development, platting or connection, deferment of the payment of such special assessment shall terminate five (5) years after the special improvement was completed or at the time title to the premises subject to deferred special assessment changes, whichever occur first. Upon the happening of either such event, the first installment of the special assessment shall become due and payable and the remaining installments shall be paid in regular annual intervals thereafter together with interest on the amount of the special assessment from the date payment of the first installment became due. The city council may after a public hearing extend the period for deferment of the payment of any such special assessment and interest thereon for such period as it finds reasonable in the light of all factors prevailing at that time. 
(c)	If after consideration of all relevant circumstances, the city council determines that it would be equitable and not detrimental to the overall best interests of the city, the city council may by resolution defer the payment of any special assessments levied against property in a special assessment district for such period as the city council shall specify, up to five (5) years. When the period of deferment ends, the first installment of the special assessment shall become due and payable and the remaining installments shall be paid in regular annual intervals thereafter together with interest on the amount of the special assessment from the date payment of the first installment became due. The city council may after a public hearing extend the period for deferment of the payment of any such special assessment and interest thereon for such period as it finds reasonable in the light of all factors prevailing at that time. 
(d)	Deferment of the payment of any special assessment shall not destroy or impair the lien of the city on the premises so assessed from the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll as above provided. The resolution deferring payment may be made as part of the resolution confirming the roll. If the city council shall by resolution determine, after notice to the owner of the property for which payment was deferred and after public hearing, that there has been a material change in the circumstances on which the deferment was based or that the best interests of the city so require, the deferment may be terminated and all or part of the deferred payments and accrued interest, if any, shall then become due and payable.

    Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the city council, be invalid by reason of irregularity of informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the city council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment.

    In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the city against the person assessed in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city which is a proper charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.

    Should any parcel of land be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed and before the complete collection thereof, the city assessor shall apportion the uncollected amounts between the several divisions thereof. The assessor shall thereupon give notice by mail to the owner of each of the several divisions of such property, insofar as the owners are known to him, and such apportionment by the assessor shall be final unless any of the owners shall file written objections thereto within fifteen (15) days thereafter, which written objections shall be filed with the city clerk and shall stand as an appeal of the apportionment to the city council. In the event of any such appeal from the apportionment of the assessor, the city council shall review the apportionment and either confirm the assessor's apportionment or make such other apportionment as shall to such council appear to be equitable in the circumstances.

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 184, effective Mary 19, 1992, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of §§ 1-14 as Ch. 23, Art. IV, §§ 23-101-23-114 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 23-101. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "Grandville City Street Number Ordinance." (referred to herein as "this article"). 
(Ord. No. 184, § 1, eff. 3-19-92) 
Sec. 23-102. - Purpose. 
    This article is enacted to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City of Grandville by requiring the uniform placement, size and display of street address numbers for all primary buildings located within the city so that each can be clearly identified and located. This will ensure that emergency vehicles while responding to emergencies can easily identify buildings and reduce the uncertainty as to the address of each building or building unit. Further, this article is intended to prevent visual blight within the city by limiting address numbers to a size no larger than required to clearly identify and locate buildings, and to prevent the unregulated use of address numbers for commercial purposes or for other purposes not related to protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of this city. 
(Ord. No. 184, § 2, eff. 3-19-92) 
Sec. 23-103. - Scope.

As used in this article, an "address number" does not include a number placed on or near a building for commercial or advertising purposes, such as a number included in the name of a business, even if that number and the address number are the same (e.g., the "504 Club" located at 504 Main Street). Address numbers may be displayed by either Arabic numerals or script. 
    Building unit shall mean an individual dwelling unit, office, business or other portion of a building which is assigned its own address number. 
    Roadway includes public and private streets, roads, avenues, boulevards, parkways and other public or private roadways and rights-of-way, as applicable to the property in question. 
    Primary roadway shall mean a roadway inside of a complex that all other roadways with the same name run off from (such as in an apartment complex where all the streets share the same name and there is a main roadway through the complex and then dead-end roadways will run off from this main or primary roadway). 
(Ord. No. 184, § 4, eff. 3-19-92) 
Sec. 23-105. - Placement.

Further, a building containing two (2) or more separate businesses or building units with separate addresses shall have a building address sign on or at the front of the building that identifies the addresses of all building units located within the building if the addresses of the individual units are not otherwise required by this section to be displayed on the exterior of the building. 
(c)	Building units with common entrances. If the front door of a building unit (residential or nonresidential) is not visible from the exterior of the building in which it is located (for example, if the front door is accessible only through an interior corridor or common area), then the building shall have a building address sign on or at the front of the building that identifies the address of the building unit (and any similarly situated building units located within the building) in a manner readily visible and clearly ascertainable from the closest abutting street. 
(d)	Variance. If due to the particular circumstances an address number cannot be placed in strict compliance with subsection (a) and (b) above, then the address number shall be located in a manner to be determined by the city fire chief which complies as closely as possible with the purpose and intent of this article and as required by the public health, safety and general welfare.

ARTICLE VIII. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 24-161. - Grounds. 
(a)	If the subdivider can clearly demonstrate that literal enforcement of this chapter is impractical or will impose undue hardship in the use of his land because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, the city council may permit such variances as, in its sound discretion, it believes to be reasonable and within the general purpose and policy of this chapter. 
(b)	In making the findings required below, the city council shall consider the recommendation of the planning commission, the location and condition of the proposed subdivision, the nature of the proposed variance as compared with the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivisions and variances on traffic conditions in the vicinity. 
(c)	No variance shall be granted unless the city council finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
(1)	There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property so that strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land. 
(2)	The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant. 
(3)	The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the state regulations, detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to other property in the area in which the property is situated.

The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council upon any requested variance. The city council may not grant a variance where such has been disapproved by the planning commission, except by a full two-thirds vote.

Chapter 24.5 - TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 24.5-1. - Purpose; application of chapter. 
(a)	Before November 1, 2002. Before November 1, 2002, the purpose of this chapter shall be to regulate the access to and ongoing use of public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers to ensure and protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to exercise reasonable control of the public rights-of-way pursuant to the City Charter, the Michigan Telecommunications Act (Act No. 216 of the Public Acts of 1995, as amended, being MCLA 484.2101 et seq.), other state statutes (including, without limitation, MCLA 247.183), and Article VII, § 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution by (1) minimizing disruption of the public rights-of-way by regulating the access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and the construction, installation, operation, and use of facilities in the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunication services, (2) ensuring that the city and the public are protected from liability for use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers, (3) providing for the payment of nondiscriminatory permit fees which do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of granting permits and maintaining the rights-of-way used by telecommunications providers, and (4) assisting telecommunications providers in understanding the city's requirements for use of the public rights-of-way and providing a fair and non-discriminatory policy for permitting the use of the public rights-of-way by such providers. 
(b)	After October 31, 2002. The Michigan Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Oversight Act, 2002 PA 48 ("Act 48") is effective November 1, 2002. In order to comply with the requirements of Act 48, the city adopted Ordinance No. 252 regarding permits for telecommunications providers issued on or after November 1, 2002. However, a number of the city's existing permits and agreements with telecommunications providers for use of the public rights-of-way, dated prior to November 1, 2002, incorporate by reference all or portions of this chapter 24.5. An example is the requirement that telecommunications providers comply with the technical and construction standards of sections 24.5-12 and 24.5-13 of the City Code. Under Sections 4(2) and 5(1) of Act 48, those existing permits and agreements continue in force and effect in accordance with their terms and conditions, subject to Section 13 (regarding fee modification) and any other applicable sections of Act 48. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or the City Code, this chapter shall, after October 31, 2002, therefore remain in effect solely for the limited purpose of applying to those public rights-of-way permits and agreements in existence before November 1, 2002 (except as otherwise provided in Act 48), and for no other purpose. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (2), this chapter 24.5 shall have no application to telecommunications providers after October 31, 2002. 
(Ord. No. 230, § 1, eff. 2-19-98; Ord. No. 252, § 24, 11-5-2002) 
Sec. 24.5-2. - Reservation of rights. 
    The issuance of a permit or permits under this chapter and the access to and use of the public rights-of-way by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights: 
(1)	Right to require franchise. Article VII, Section 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution and the City Charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city. The applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under Section 102(dd) of the Michigan Telecommunications Act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services. Due to this and other legal and regulatory issues, and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary, the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city. Telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way and to otherwise comply with the terms of this chapter. Such a permit shall not constitute a franchise. The city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city. 
(2)	Rights regarding takings claim. Certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rights-of-way and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property. Municipalities dispute that claim. The city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would, among other things, constitute an unlawful taking by the United States in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided. The city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rights-of-way at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues, provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a permittee is not precluded by this chapter from seeking relief from the fee provisions of section 24.5-10 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction. If a permittee seeks such relief, the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary is support thereof. Neither this chapter nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues, and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee. 
(3)	Option to obtain consent agreement. The city finds that legislative, legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy, competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community. This would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers. The issues affect, among other things, both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rights-of-way. In order to promote certainty, encourage competition and avoid litigation, the city will, at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee, consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rights-of-way for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider. It is the city's intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this chapter, and would include, among other things, a fee of up to five (5) percent of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider, which would include the permit fee; an extended term of up to fifteen (15) years; authorization to conduct a local business in the city pursuant to article VII, section 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution; and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes, notwithstanding the resolution of these legislative, regulatory and legal requirements in the future. A permittee may request a consent agreement at any time. 
(Ord. No. 230, § 1, eff. 2-19-98) 
Sec. 24.5-3. - City signal; permit. 
    City Signal, Inc. and the city entered into a right-of-way agreement in 1990, which has since been amended, including a 1995 amendment which permitted City Signal (now Brooks Fiber Communications) to use the public rights-of-way to provide local telephone service within the city in accordance with the terms and conditions of the right-of-way agreement, as amended. For purposes of this section, the term "agreement" shall refer to the 1990 right-of-way agreement, as amended. The agreement contains requirements for the use of the public rights-of-way that are substantially similar to the requirements of this chapter. For purposes of this chapter, the agreement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of a permit under this chapter and under the Telecommunications Act for the term of the agreement. Any requests of Brooks Fiber Communications for expansion of its telecommunications system shall be considered in accordance with the agreement. Upon expiration of the agreement, Brooks Fiber Communications shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions of this chapter as it may be amended from time to time.

No person shall use the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services without a permit issued pursuant to this chapter or a consent agreement under section 24.5-2(3) of this chapter. For purposes of this chapter, use of the public rights-of-way includes the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of a telecommunications system, within the public rights-of-way. In addition, a person providing local exchange service or other local telecommunications services is using the public rights-of-way for purposes of this chapter whether such person owns the facilities in the public rights-of-way outright or obtains the use of or access to the facilities from a third party under lease, contract, interconnection, or wholesale for retail or other similar arrangement.

(Ord. No. 230, § 1, eff. 2-19-98) 
Sec. 24.5-8. - Permit application procedures.

The nonrefundable application fee shall be designed to reimburse the city for the costs of reviewing an application for a permit and issuance of a permit in accordance with the procedures of this chapter. 
(d)	Administrative completeness. An application shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of the ninety-day permit application review period in Section 251(3) of the Telecommunications Act unless and until the application is determined by the city manager to be administratively complete. A determination whether the application is administratively complete shall be made by the city manager within ten (10) business days after the application is received by the city. If the city manager determines that the application is not administratively complete, the city manager shall so advise the applicant in writing and shall identify the items which must be furnished by the applicant for an administratively complete application. 
(e)	Additional information. The city manager may request an applicant to submit such additional information which the city manager deems reasonably necessary or relevant to review the application. The applicant shall comply with all such requests in compliance with reasonable deadlines for such additional information established by the city manager.

(f)	Misleading statements. A person who provides information to the city in connection with a permit application or any other matters under this section 24.5-8 which contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall be in violation of this chapter, and shall be subject to all remedies for violation of this chapter and the City Code including, without limitation, denial of the requested action and permit revocation pursuant to section 24.5-18. Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter. 
(g)	Permit approval or denial. Within seventy-five (75) days after the city manager determines that the application is administratively complete (subject to any adjustments for delays in providing additional information as provided in subsection (e)), the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper in general circulation not less than ten (10) days before the public hearing.

Following the public hearing, the city council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application within ninety (90) days after the city manager determines that the application is administratively complete pursuant to subsection (d), subject to any adjustments for delays in providing additional information as provided in subsection (e). The city council shall not unreasonably deny an application for a permit. The failure of the city to comply strictly with the procedural requirements of this section 24.5-8 for the review of permit applications shall not invalidate the decision or proceedings of the city. 
(h)	Conditions. The city council may impose conditions on a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Without limitation, these conditions may include the posting of a bond by the telecommunications provider in an amount which shall not exceed the reasonable cost to ensure that the public rights-of-way are returned to their original condition during and after the telecommunications provider's access and use. 
(i)	Modification. The city council may, in its discretion, grant a modification of a specific requirement of sections 24.5-11, 24.5-12, 24.5-13, or 24.5-16 of this chapter if the applicant requests such modification in its application for a permit and if the applicant demonstrates that: 
(1)	There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances which warrant a modification;
(2)	The modification will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; and 
(3)	The modification will not impair the intent and purposes of this chapter and its several sections. 
The application shall describe the applicant's request for a modification and the reasons for the request with specificity. A modification granted by the city council pursuant to this section shall expire upon the expiration of the permit or earlier if so determined by the city council. A modification shall modify only those requirements expressly set forth in the approval of the city council and shall not modify any other provisions of this chapter. If a request for a modification is denied by the city council, the telecommunications provider shall comply with all requirements of this chapter without exception. 
(j)	Waiver. The city council shall grant a waiver of any requirement of this chapter if an applicant or permittee requests a waiver and the city council finds that: 
(1)	Unless waived, the requirement will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of the applicant or permittee to provide any telecommunications service within the meaning of Section 253(a) of the Federal Telecommunications Act, 47 USC Section 253(a); 
(2)	The requirement is not within the scope of any state or local authority referenced in Section 253(c) of the Federal Telecommunications Act, 47 USC Section 253(c), and 
(3)	The requirement is not necessary to protect the public safety and welfare or safeguard the rights of consumers. A request for a waiver may be included in an application for a permit. A request for a waiver shall include a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the request. If the request is made in connection with an application for a permit, the provisions of sections 24.5-8(d) through 24.5-8(g) shall apply to the request, except that submission of a request for a waiver shall constitute consent that the time periods provided in section 24.5-8(g) for holding a public hearing and acting on an application are extended by ninety (90) days. Sections 24.5-8(a), 24.5-8(c), and section 24.5-8(f) shall apply to a waiver request that is not made in connection with a permit application, and the request may be denied for violation of or failure to comply with any of those provisions. Section 24.5-8(g) shall also apply to such a request, with the exception of the seventy-five- and ninety-day time periods set forth in that section, but the city council may by resolution establish different or additional procedures for conducting the public hearing and acting on the request.

Sec. 24.5-10. - Annual permit fees. 
(a)	Establishment of annual fees; payment. In addition to the nonrefundable application fee set forth in section 24.5-8(c) and any other fees for other permits or authorizations required by the City Code, the permittee shall pay an annual fee in an amount established by ordinance or resolution of the city council. The annual fee may be modified from time to time by ordinance or resolution of the city council. The amount of the annual fee shall not exceed the fixed and variable costs to the city in maintaining the public rights-of-way used by a telecommunications provider unless otherwise permitted by law. The annual fee shall be payable quarterly as follows: 
1st quarter (Jan. 1 - March 31) .....April 302nd quarter (April 1 - June 30) .....July 313rd quarter (July 1 - Sept 30) .....October 314th quarter (Oct. 1 - Dec. 31) .....January 31 
When a permit is issued during a calendar year, the annual fee shall be prorated for the balance of the calendar year. In the event that a quarterly payment is not paid when due, the permittee shall pay a late payment charge of the greater of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or interest at the rate of one (1) percent over the prime rate then charged by NBD Bank and computed monthly. A person who violates this chapter by failing to obtain a permit shall pay the annual fee plus late payment charges, as required by this section, for the time period in which the violator did not have a permit plus the actual costs of the city in enforcing this chapter against the person. 
(b)	Option to pay annual fee based upon gross revenues. A permittee, at its option, may elect to pay an annual fee of one (1) percent of its annual gross revenues as set forth below, in lieu of and in full satisfaction of the annual fee established by the city council pursuant to section 24.5-10(a). Permittees may elect this annual fee option for administrative convenience in computing the fee or for any other reason. 
(1)	An election shall be made within forty-five (45) days of applying for a permit or at least sixty (60) days before the start of any calendar year after issuance of a permit. 
(2)	Any election, once made, shall continue in effect until the end of the next three (3) calendar years, such that an election made in a permit application in 1997 would continue in effect through the end of the year 2000. 
(3)	An election shall be made on a form provided by the city. Copies of the form shall be submitted in the manner provided in section 24.5-8(a). The permittee shall supply all information requested on the form and any additional information that the city manager deems reasonably necessary or relevant including information on affiliates of the permittee relating to the requirements of sections 24.5-10(b)(5), 24.5-10(b)(6), 24.5-10(b)(7), and 24.5-10(c). After providing notice and an opportunity to be heard the city may reject or revoke an election for failure to comply with this section 24.5 10(b)(3). 
(4)	The annual fees shall be paid quarterly by the same due dates as are set forth in section 24.5-10(a) above. 
(5)	An election shall apply to all affiliates of a permittee. In making its election, a permittee shall expressly affirm that it has the authority to bind, and does bind, its affiliates to the obligations of this section 24.5-10(b) including section 24.5-10(b)(6) and the audit and records provisions of section 24.5 10(b)(7) and 24.5-10(c). 
(6)	For purposes of this section 24.5-10(b), "gross revenues" is defined in Appendix A. 
(7)	If a permittee or any affiliate of a permittee refuses to pay the fees due under this option or prohibits or effectively prohibits the city from auditing the permittee or its affiliates under section 24.5-10(c) to verify the accuracy of annual fees, then the city at its option may revoke the election for all or any portion of the time period in question. The annual fees computed under section 24.5-10(a) shall then become immediately due and payable, less a credit for any sums paid by the permittee or its affiliates, plus the late payment charges set forth in section 24.5-10(a) and any additional sums due under the last sentence of section 24.5-10(c). 
(c)	Records. All records (including those of affiliates) reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of annual fees paid by the permittee under either section 24.5-10(a) or section 24.5-10(b) shall be made available by a permittee at a location within the city or within twenty (20) miles of the city's boundaries. The city, by itself or in combination with other municipalities reserves the right to audit any permittee (or any affiliate of a permittee) to verify the accuracy of annual fees paid or to be paid to the city. Any additional amount due the city shall be paid within thirty (30) days of submission of an invoice. If the additional amount due exceeds two (2) percent of the total annual fee which the audit determines should have been paid for a calendar year, the permittee shall pay the city's costs in connection with the audit within thirty (30) days of submission of an invoice. 
(d)	Other payments. The nonrefundable application fees and the annual fees established pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to any tax, charge, fee, or payment due, or to become due, to the city by a permittee under the City Code or the laws of the State of Michigan. 
(e)	Misleading statements. A person who provides information to the city in connection with any matter under this section 24.5-10 which contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall be in violation of this chapter, and shall be subject to all remedies for violation of this chapter and the City Code including, without limitation, rejection or revocation of an election under section 24.5-10(b) and permit revocation pursuant to section 24.5-18. Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter.

The issuance of additional permits, entry into agreements, or grant of franchises shall not be deemed to amend, modify, revoke, or terminate the terms and conditions of any permits previously issued to telecommunication providers. 
(b)	Expansion requests. A permit approved by the city council shall authorize access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way described in the permit, subject to strict compliance with the conditions of the permit, the requirements of this chapter, and any other applicable requirements of the City Code or applicable state and federal law. The permittee shall not use any public rights-of-way not expressly authorized by the permit. Any use of the public rights-of-way (including any installation, construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of a telecommunication system, within the public rights-of-way) to provide telecommunications services shall be performed only as authorized by the permit. A permittee may, however, expand its telecommunications system to public rights-of-ways not described in its permit by obtaining approval of an amended permit from the city. Such approval may be granted in writing by the city manager in response to a written request from the permittee for expansion to specific portions of named public rights-of-way. The city council may establish by resolution a nonrefundable application fee for such a request. The city manager may grant, grant with conditions, or deny such request. The city manager shall not unreasonably deny any request. A denial of any request may be appealed to the city council which shall make the final decision. Any expansion into additional public rights-of-way shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the original permit and this chapter including, without limitation, the application of the annual fee to the expanded public rights-of-way used by the permittee. 
(c)	Construction permit. A permittee shall not commence construction upon, over, across or under the public rights-of-way in the city without first obtaining a construction permit as required under chapter 23 of the City Code, as amended, for construction within the public rights-of-way. 
(d)	Lease or use of facilities; overlashing. A permittee shall not lease, sublease, license or otherwise allow the use of wires, conduit, poles or facilities in the public rights-of-way by a person who is required to obtain a permit under section 24.5-7 of this chapter or is required by law to obtain the city's permission or consent to transact local business in the city, and who lacks such permit, permission or consent. A permittee shall not allow the property of a third party or non-telecommunications system wires or any other facilities to be overlashed, affixed or attached to any portion of a permittee's telecommunications system; or allow other actions with a similar result, without the written consent of the city manager. 
(e)	"As built" Maps. Without expense to the city, a permittee shall provide the city with "as-built" maps, records and plans showing its telecommunications system or portions thereof, within the city, including those of affiliates used by the permittee, and maps and descriptive information of facilities of other persons used by the permittee. The city manager may waive part or all of this requirement if satisfactory records of the location of the telecommunications system were previously provided to the city. The "as built" maps, records and plans shall be provided within thirty (30) days of the completion of the telecommunications system and any extensions, additions, or modifications to the telecommunications system. In addition to the foregoing, a permittee, without expense to the city, shall, upon forty-eight (48) hours' notice, give the city access to all "as-built" maps, records, plans and specifications showing its telecommunications system or portions thereof within the city. Upon request by the city, a permittee shall inform the city as soon as possible (but no more than one (1) business day after the request) of any changes from previously supplied maps, records, or plans and shall mark up maps provided by the city so as to show the location of its telecommunications system. 
(f)	No recourse. A permittee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of the failure of the city to have the authority to grant all or any part of a permit or the authority to grant permission to use all or part of the public rights-of-way. A permittee expressly acknowledges that on accepting a permit it did so relying on its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city. 
(g)	No inducement. By acceptance of a permit, a permittee acknowledges that it has not been induced to obtain the permit by any understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or written, by or on behalf of the city or by any third person concerning any term or condition of a permit not expressed in this chapter. 
(h)	Acceptance of terms and conditions. The permittee acknowledges by the acceptance of a permit that it has carefully read its terms and conditions and does accept all of such terms and conditions. 
(i)	No priority. A permit does not establish any priority of use of the public rights-of-way by a permittee over any present or future permittees or parties having agreements with the city or franchises for such use. In the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the public rights-of-way, the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to the city, the third priority to the State of Michigan and its political subdivisions in the performance of their various functions, and thereafter as between permittees, other permit holders, parties having agreements with the city, and franchisees, as determined by the city in the exercise of its powers, including the police power and other powers reserved to and conferred on it by the State of Michigan. 
(j)	Future use by city. A permittee acknowledges, by accepting a permit, that it obtains no rights to or further use of the public rights-of-way other than those expressly granted herein. Each permittee acknowledges and accepts as its own risk that the city may make use in the future of the public rights-of-way which a permittee is using or in which a permittee's telecommunications system is located in a manner inconsistent with the permittee's use of such public rights-of-way and that in such event the permittee will not be entitled to compensation from the city. 
(k)	Expiration of permit. Unless the city grants an extension, a permit shall expire one (1) year from the date of issuance unless prior thereto the permittee either: 
(1)	Commences construction, installation, or operation of its telecommunications system within the public rights-of-way authorized by the permit and diligently pursues completion of construction or installation; or 
(2)	Commences use of the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services as authorized by the permit. 
(Ord. No. 230, § 1, eff. 2-19-98) 
Sec. 24.5-13. - Use of public rights-of-way by permittee. 
(a)	No burden on public rights-of-way. A permittee and its contractors and subcontractors and a permittee's telecommunications system shall not unduly burden or interfere with the present or future use of any of the public rights-of-way within the city. A permittee shall erect and maintain its telecommunications system so as to cause minimum interference with the use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners. The permittee's cables and wires shall be suspended or buried so as to not endanger or injure persons or property in the public rights-of-way. If the city in its reasonable judgment determines that any portion of the telecommunications system constitutes an undue burden or interference, the permittee at its sole cost and expense shall modify its telecommunications systems or take such other actions as the city may determine are in the public interest to remove or alleviate the burden, and the permittee shall do so within the time period established by the city. 
(b)	Restoration of property. A permittee and its contractors and subcontractors shall immediately restore, at the permittee's sole cost and expense and in a manner approved by the city, any portion of the public rights-of-way that is in any way disturbed, damaged, or injured by the construction, operation, maintenance or removal of the telecommunications system to as good or better condition than that which existed prior to the disturbance. In the event that the permittee, its contractors or subcontractors fail to do so within the time specified by the city, the city shall be entitled to complete the work and the permittee shall reimburse the city for the costs of doing so. 
(c)	Easements. Any easements over or under private property necessary for the construction or operation of a telecommunications system shall be arranged and paid for by the permittee. Any use or intrusion on private property without an easement or other instrument evidencing permission of the property owner shall constitute a trespass by the permittee and a violation of this chapter. Any easements over or under property owned by the city other than the public rights-of-way shall be separately negotiated with the city. 
(d)	Tree trimming. A permittee may trim trees upon and overhanging the public rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with its telecommunications system. The permittee shall minimize the trimming of trees to trimming only those trees that are essential to maintain the integrity of its telecommunications system. No trimming shall be done in the public rights-of way without previously informing the city. 
(e)	Pavement cut coordination/additional fees. A permittee shall coordinate all construction work in the public rights-of-way with the city's program for street construction, rebuilding, resurfacing and repair (collectively, "street resurfacing"). A permittee shall meet with the official of the city primarily responsible for the public rights-of-way at least twice per year to this end. 
    The goals of such coordination shall be to require a permittee to conduct all work in the public rights-of-way in conjunction with or immediately prior to any street resurfacing planned by the city, and to prevent the public rights-of-way from being disturbed by a permittee for a period of years after such street resurfacing. 
    In addition to any other fees or payments required by this chapter, a permittee shall pay to the city the sum of one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250.00) for each fifty (50) feet cut into or excavation of any public rights-of-way, or portion thereof, which was subject to street resurfacing within eighteen (18) months prior to such cut or excavation. This fee is in addition to and not in lieu of the obligation to restore the public rights-of-way and is in addition to all other fees required by this chapter or the City Code. 
(f)	Marking. A permittee shall mark any installations of its telecommunications system which occur after the effective date of this chapter as follows:

(2)	Direct buried underground portions of its telecommunications system shall have (i) a conducting wire placed in the ground at least several inches above the permittee's cable (if such cable is non-conductive), (ii) at least several inches above that, a continuous colored tape with the permittee's name and a toll-free phone number and a statement to the effect that there is buried cable beneath, and (iii) stakes or other appropriate aboveground markers, with the permittee's name and a toll-free number indicating that there is buried telephone cable below. 
(3)	Portions of its telecommunications system located in conduit, including facilities of others used by a permittee, shall be marked at each manhole with the permittee's name and toll-free telephone number to call for assistance. 
(g)	Compliance with laws. A permittee shall comply with all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding the installation, construction, ownership and use of its telecommunications system, whether federal, state or local, now in force or which hereafter may be promulgated (including, without limitation, any ordinance requiring the installation of additional conduit when a permittee installs underground conduit for its telecommunications system). Before any installation is commenced, the permittee shall secure all necessary permits, licenses and approvals from all appropriate departments, agencies, boards or commissions of the city or other governmental entity as may be required by law, including, without limitation, all utility line permits and highway permits. A permittee shall comply in all respects with applicable codes and industry standards, including but not limited to the National Electrical Safety Code (latest edition) and the National Electric Code (latest edition). A permittee shall comply with all zoning and land use ordinances and historic preservation ordinances as may exist or may hereafter be amended. 
(h)	Street vacation. If the city vacates or consents to the vacation of public rights-of-way, within its jurisdiction and such vacation necessitates the removal and relocation of a permittee's facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the permittee shall, as a condition of the permit, consent to the vacation and move its facilities at its sole cost and expense when ordered to do so by the city or a court of competent jurisdiction. The permittee shall relocate its facilities to such alternate route as the city, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall designate. 
(i)	Relocation. If the city requests a permittee to relocate, protect, support, disconnect, place underground or remove its facilities because of street or utility work, or other public projects, the permittee shall relocate, protect, support, disconnect, place underground or remove its facilities, at its sole cost and expense, to such alternate route as the city, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall designate. The work shall be completed within the time period designated by the city. 
(j)	Public emergency. The city shall have the right to sever, disrupt, dig-up or otherwise destroy facilities of a permittee, without any prior notice, if such action is deemed necessary by the mayor, city manager, police chief, or fire chief or their designees because of a public emergency. "Public emergency" shall be any condition which, in the opinion of any of the officials named, poses an immediate threat to life, health, or property caused by any natural or man-made disaster, including, but not limited to, storms, floods, fire, accidents, explosions, major watermain breaks, hazardous material spills, etc. The permittee shall be responsible for repair at its sole cost and expense of any of its facilities damaged pursuant to any such action taken by the city. 
(k)	Miss Dig. If eligible to join, a permittee shall subscribe to and be a member of "MISS DIG," the association of utilities formed pursuant to Act 53 of the Public Acts of 1974, as amended, MCL 460.701 et seq., and shall conduct its business in conformance with the statutory provisions and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
(l)	Use of existing facilities; undergrounding. A permittee shall utilize existing poles, conduits, and other facilities wherever practicable, and shall not construct or install any new, different, or additional poles or other facilities unless expressly authorized by the permit. Where utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial construction or subsequent thereto, a permittee's telecommunications system shall also be located underground unless otherwise expressly authorized by the permit. All undergrounding shall be at the sole cost and expense of the permittee. 
(m)	Underground relocation. If a permittee has its facilities on poles of consumers' energy company or another public utility company and consumers' energy company or other public utility company relocates its facilities underground, the permittee shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location at the permittee's sole cost and expense. 
(n)	Pole/conduit license agreement; notification. If a permittee forfeits or otherwise loses its rights under a pole/conduit license agreement with consumers' energy company or other entity, then permittee shall notify the city manager in writing within thirty (30) days. 
(o)	Identification. All personnel of a permittee and its contractors or subcontractors who have as part of their normal duties contact with the general public shall wear on their clothing a clearly visible identification card bearing their name and photograph. A permittee shall account for all identification cards at all times.

APPENDIX A. - GROSS REVENUES 
    For the purpose of section 24.5-10(b), "gross revenues" means all amounts earned, received or accrued by a permittee and its affiliates in whatever form and from all sources which are in connection with or attributable to the permittee's telecommunications system in city or to the permittee's or its affiliates' provision of telecommunications services within the city. 
(1)	Gross revenues shall include, but not be limited to, all revenues from or attributable to customers, other carriers, or third parties whether for services, equipment, directories, publications, or otherwise. It shall include revenues of the types generally described in the revenue accounts of the FCC Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies as in effect on October 31, 1996, 47 CFR section 32 subpart D, whether or not the permittee or its affiliates are subject to such system of accounts, including Accounts 4999 through 5302 and any cross-referenced accounts or subaccounts which may be established by permittee or its affiliates relating to the preceding account numbers. Gross revenues shall include all services provided by a permittee or its affiliates, whether or not subject to regulation at the federal, state or local level. For transactions with affiliates gross revenues shall be computed in accordance with the principles set forth in 47 CFR section 32.27 as in effect on October 31, 1996, including in particular section 32.27(d), and otherwise at the fair market rate. 
(2)	Gross revenues shall include all amounts received, earned, or accrued during a period regardless of whether (a) received or not in the case of amounts earned or accrued; (b) the amounts are to be paid in cash, in trade, or by means of some other benefit to the permittee or its affiliates; (c) the goods or services with which the revenue is associated are provided at cost or the revenue amount can be matched against an equivalent expenditure; (d) the amounts are characterized, separately identified, or accounted as being for goods, services, or fees to be paid to units of government or government agencies; or (e) the amounts are initially recorded or received by the permittee or by an affiliate. However, gross revenues shall exclude uncollectible accounts during the period, computed on a fair basis consistently applied. 
(3)	Gross revenues shall be computed at the level where first received from an entity not in any way affiliated with the permittee and shall not be net of (a) any operating expense; (b) any accrual, including without limitation, any accrual for commissions; or (c) any other expenditure. 
(4)	Revenues from customers shall be allocated to the city based upon whether or not the location being provided service pursuant to the permit is located in the city and not by any other allocation method. Revenues from non-switched telecommunications services shall be allocated to the city as set forth in Appendix A-1. 
(5)	Revenues whose source cannot be identified with a specific customer or city shall be allocated to the city based upon the percentage of customers in the city compared to the number of customers served by that portion of permittee's telecommunications system (including portions outside the city) to which such revenues are reasonably attributable. 
(Ord. No. 230, § 1, eff. 2-19-98) 
APPENDIX A-1. - ALLOCATION OF REVENUE FROM NON-SWITCHED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 
    Gross revenues from non-switched telecommunications services shall be allocated to the city as follows: 
a.	For purposes of this Appendix A-1, "non-switched telecommunications services" means the two-way transmission of high speed digital voice, data and (for such applications as teleconferencing) video signals (i) to carry interexchange traffic between long distance carrier points-of-presence; (ii) to interconnect user locations to interexchange carrier points-of-presence; and (iii) to interconnect user locations. 
b.	If all the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in the city, gross revenues shall include all revenues received from or imputed to that customer. 
c.	If any but not all of the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in the city, the revenues attributable to the city shall be computed separately for each service taken by the customer. For each separate service taken the revenues attributable to the city are all revenues received from or imputed to that service times a fraction whose numerator is the number of locations of the customer within the city taking that service and whose denominator is all the customer's locations taking that service. 
d.	If (such as with an interexchange carrier which contracts for capacity from the permittee so as to connect with its customers through the permittee's telecommunications system) a customer uses the permittee's telecommunications system to connect to third parties, such third parties shall be treated as customers (or customer locations, as the case may be) for purposes of this provision and revenue attribution thereunder. "Interexchange carrier" means a person who provides interexchange telecommunications service, commonly called a long distance carrier (Sprint, MCI and AT&T are examples), and typically deemed a carrier under the Federal Communications Act of 1934 or amendments thereto. 
e.	The different services taken by customers shall correspond with the classes of service offered by the permittee. 
f.	Examples of the preceding computations are as follows:
Example 1 
A customer leases a 56 kbps data channel for $5,000/month which serves/may be accessed by 1 customer location each in Municipality A, Municipality B, and Municipality C. 
$1,666/month is Gross revenues from Municipality A (1/3 times $5,000). 
Example 2 
A customer leases 3 T-1 telephone lines @ $400/month to connect to MCI. Gross revenues from Municipality A are computed separately for each line as follows: 
The first connects a location in Municipality B to an MCI point of presence in Municipality A. $200/month is the gross revenues from Municipality A for this service (1/2 times $400). 
The second connects a location in Municipality A to the same MCI point of presence. All $400 is gross revenues from Municipality A for this service. 
The third connects a location in Municipality C to a different MCI point of presence, located in Municipality D. There are no gross revenues from Municipality A for this service (but there would be gross revenues of $200 each in Municipality C and Municipality D). 
Example 3 
Sprint, an interexchange (long distance) carrier, leases a large amount of capacity from the permittee for $50,000/month so that persons desiring to use its services may connect with it directly and not have to go through the local Ameritech central office. Sixteen (16) customers take advantage of this service, comprising 42 locations, of which 28 locations are in Municipality A. Sprint's point of presence is also in Municipality A. 
$41,667 is gross revenues from Municipality A as follows: 
$25,000 (half of the $50,000) is included because all the circuits (wherever the customer is located) connect to the point of presence in Municipality A, i.e.-each customer circuit is composed of two locations (one at the customer, one at Sprint), one of which is in Municipality A. 
$16,667 (28/42 of $25,000) because the other half of the $50,000 is attributable to the specific customer locations being connected to Sprint, of which 28 out of 42 are in Municipality A.

In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials (A.S.T.M.) and the Water Pollution Control Federation (W.P.C.F.) shall apply. 
(1)	If the building sewer is located within ten (10) feet of a water service pipe, is exposed to damage by tree roots, or is installed in filled or otherwise unstable ground, the use of vitrified clay pipe or cement asbestos pipe for that part of the sewer so situated is prohibited. The building sewer shall not be located closer than three (3) feet on a horizontal plane to any other utility service. 
(2)	The size of the building sewer shall not be less than four (4) inches when cast iron is used and six (6) inches when clay pipe is used. The slope shall not be less than one-eighth inch per lineal foot. 
(3)	Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to and within three (3) feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe or long-radius fittings with a cleanout at each curved pipe. 
(4)	In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the building sewer, sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(5)	All excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the city manager. No backfill shall be performed until the work has been inspected and approved by the city manager. Under no circumstances shall cinders be used as backfill.

If the public sewer is twelve (12) inches in diameter or less, and no "Y" branch is available at a suitable location, the owner shall, at the owner's expense, install a "Y" branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the city manager. If the public sewer is greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter, and no "Y" branch is available at a suitable location, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about forty-five (45) degrees. A forty-five (45) degree ell may be used to make the connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The inside crown line of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or higher elevation than the inside crown line of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection shall be made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only if approved by the city manager. 
(7)	All excavation for building sewer installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
(h)	Inspection required. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the city department of public works when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the city department of public works within forty-eight (48) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) of receipt of notice by the department of public works. 
(i)	Connection of surface runoff or groundwater prohibited. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.

(24)	Any substance which may cause the effluent from the POTW or any other product of the sewage works, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or cause interference with the reclamation process, or which otherwise inhibits or disrupts the POTW sludge processes, use or disposal. 
(25)	Any liquid, solid or gas, including, without limitation, any toxic pollutant or hazardous substance, which by reason of its nature or quantity is or may be sufficient, either singly or by combination or interaction with other substances, to be injurious in any way to the POTW, the POTW treatment facilities, processes or operations; to endanger human health or the environment; to create a public nuisance; to result in noncompliance with the POTW's NPDES permit or the water quality standards of the receiving water; or to result in noncompliance with any other applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. 
(26)	Any trucked wastes or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the city manager and subject to the prior approval of the city manager. The city manager shall determine whether to permit the discharge of trucked wastes or hauled pollutants based on the particular nature or quantity of the proposed discharge in accordance with the discharge prohibitions, limitations and requirements provided by this division. The city manager may impose any conditions on the discharge determined necessary to ensure compliance with this division, including, without limitation, requiring a certification or manifest to verify the source of the wastes, or sampling and analysis of individual truckloads prior to discharge. 
(27)	Any pollutant or discharge prohibited by, or in excess of the limitation contained in, any applicable order of determination. 
(c)	Pretreatment standards and requirements. The following provisions shall apply in determining compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements: 
(1)	The categorical pretreatment standards when finalized for specific industries shall become a part of the requirements of this division in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations. A user shall comply with all categorical pretreatment standards and any other pretreatment requirements established under the FWPCA that are applicable to that user. If specific parameter levels established by this division are more restrictive than an equivalent federal or state requirement, the more restrictive parameter level established by this division shall apply. 
(2)	If federal categorical standards are expressed in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production, the city may elect to convert these limits to equivalent limitation expressed as either a mass of pollutant discharged per day or an effluent concentration. Equivalent discharge limits calculated in accordance with federal regulations (40 CFR 403.6) shall be deemed pretreatment standards and enforceable as pretreatment standards. Any industrial user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard that does not notify the superintendent of significant changes in production levels as required by 40 CFR 403.6(c)(9) or MAC 323.2311(5)(g) shall be required to meet the applicable mass or concentration limits that were based on the original estimate of the long term production rate. 
(3)	A user may apply to the superintendent for an adjustment in a categorical pretreatment standard to reflect the presence of pollutants in the user's intake water in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15 (net/gross calculations). In the event that adjustment is made, the adjusted categorical pretreatment standard shall apply, provided the adjustment will not result in interference or pass through. 
(4)	If process effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the POTW, or by the industrial user with the written approval of the POTW, for application to the mixed effluent as provided by 40 CFR 403.6(e) (combined waste stream formula) and MAC 323.2311(7). 
(5)	Existing sources shall comply with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements in accordance with the deadline for compliance provided by 40 CFR 403.6(b) and as provided by the city. New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety (90) days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(6)	Alternative categorical limits may be derived and applied to an industrial user otherwise subject to categorical standards pursuant to MAC 323.2313, at the city manager's discretion. 
(d)	Reserved right of revision. Future conditions imposed on the city by other government agencies may require subsequent amendment of this division by the city. If federal pretreatment standards require limits on parameters not covered in this division or limits more stringent than those specified in this division, the federal limits shall control and shall be complied with within the time period provided by 40 CFR 403.6(b). The city reserves the right to establish more restrictive prohibitions, limitation or requirements for discharges to the POTW as necessary to prevent interference, pass through, to protect the POTW, to comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations, to comply with the POTW's NPDES permit, or otherwise as determined necessary by the city. 
(e)	Special agreements. Nothing in this division shall be construed as preventing a special agreement between the city and any user (which may be in the form of an order of determination). The special arrangements may include, but are not limited to, pollutant concentration discharge limitations different than those provided in this section. The city shall not be obligated to enter into a special agreement, but may do so in its discretion. A special agreement shall not create any vested rights or property rights in the user. The special agreement may be terminated or modified at will by the city. As a condition to the issuance of or entry into a special agreement, the city shall require the user to sign an acknowledgement and acceptance of the provisions of this section. A special agreement or arrangement may contain provision for the user to pay a surcharge to the city. A violation of the terms of a special agreement shall be a violation of this division. No special agreement shall be entered into which, in the opinion of the city manager, has the potential to cause or result in a discharge which violates applicable pretreatment standards or the discharge prohibitions established by this division, to cause or result in pass through or interference, or to endanger public health or the environment. 
(f)	Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. Unless expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with any pretreatment standard or requirement. 
(g)	Pretreatment required prior to point of discharge. The discharge prohibition, limitation and requirements provided by this division or by any order or special agreement shall apply at the point where wastewater and pollutants are discharged or caused to be discharged into the POTW and any required pretreatment shall be effected prior to that point of discharge. 
(h)	Authority for control of discharges to POTW. If any user discharges or proposes to discharge wastewaters or pollutants to the POTW which are prohibited or limited by this division, the city manager may issue an order, enter into a special agreement, impose surcharges, assess fines and penalties, or take any other action as authorized by this division or by other applicable law or regulation to assure and require compliance with this division. 
(Ord. No. 280, § 2, eff. 2-19-2010) 
Sec. 26-106. - Industrial waste control program. 
(a)	Notice of intent to discharge; information required. Prior to connecting to the POTW and commencing any discharge to the POTW, all nondomestic users must notify the city of the nature and characteristics of their processes and proposed discharge. Existing industrial users already connected to the POTW or discharging to the POTW shall submit the notice and required information upon request of the city manager. The notice of intent to discharge shall be made on forms prepared by the city, or in the form prescribed by the city, for that purpose. The city manager shall determine whether the user will be considered a significant industrial user for purposes of this division based on the information received from the user (in addition to any other information that may be available regarding the user's processes or discharge). The information required by this section shall be provided by the user in units and terms appropriate for adequate evaluation by the city manager, and shall include at least the following as applicable to the user: 
(1)	User name, address, and location (if different than address).
(2)	Whether the user is a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, or other type of entity, and the name of the person(s) responsible for discharges by the user. 
(3)	Standard industrial classification (SIC) code of both the industry (or use) as a whole and any processes for which categorical pretreatment standards have been promulgated. 
(4)	Wastewater constituents and characteristics, including, without limitation, the nature and quantity of any pollutants which are limited or regulated by any federal, state, or local standards or requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the U.S. EPA and contained in 40 CFR part 136. 
(5)	Time and duration of discharges.
(6)	Daily maximum, daily average, and monthly average wastewater flow rates, including daily, monthly, and seasonal variation, if any. 
(7)	Description of activities, facilities, and plant process on the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used at the facility which are or could be (by accident or otherwise) discharged to the POTW. 
(8)	Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details to show all sewers, sewer connections, floor drain, inspection manholes, sampling chambers, and appurtenances by size, location and elevation. 
(9)	Each product produced by type, amount, process, and rate of production, as relevant to pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(10)	Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per day), including copies of material safety data sheets. 
(11)	Number and type of employees, and hours of operation, and proposed or actual hours of operation of the pretreatment system. 
(12)	A listing of and copies of all environmental permits held by the user applicable to the premises. 
(13)	A statement whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the user to meet all applicable federal, state and local standards and requirements. If additional O&M or additional pretreatment will be required to meet the applicable standards and requirements, then the user shall indicate the shortest time schedule necessary to accomplish installation or adoption of the additional O&M and/or pretreatment. The completion date in this compliance schedule shall not be longer than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following conditions shall apply to this schedule: 
a.	The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (including, without limitation, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, beginning operation, conducting routine operation, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this division). No progress increment referred to above shall exceed two (2) months. 
b.	No later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the city manager including, at a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the schedule established. In no event shall more than three (3) months elapse between the progress reports to the city manager. 
(14)	Any other information determined necessary by the city manager to adequately evaluate the impacts of the discharge on the POTW and on POTW operations and treatment processes. To the extent that actual data is not available for a new source, the user shall supply estimated or expected information. All information requested by the city manager shall be submitted by the user to the city manager as soon as possible, but in no case later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the request for information. 
(15)	All notices and information submitted by a user as required by this section shall be signed and certified as provided by section 26-106(c)(9). 
(b)	Sampling, analysis and monitoring. Unless expressly provided otherwise for a particular industrial user by an order or special agreement, all users shall sample, monitor and analyze their discharges to the POTW according to the following minimum requirements: 
(1)	Sampling and analytical techniques and procedures. All sampling, measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of discharges to the POTW shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the U.S. EPA contained in 40 CFR Part 136. If the city manager determines that these sampling and analytical techniques are not available or do not apply to the discharge or pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated sampling and analytical methods and procedures approved by the city manager. 
(2)	Sampling frequency. Users shall sample their discharges to the POTW at a frequency necessary to assess and assure compliance with the requirements of this division, any order issued pursuant to this division, all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, other applicable state and federal laws and regulation, or as otherwise determined necessary by the city manager consistent with the purposes and intent of this division. At a minimum, all users shall sample their effluent two (2) times per year and report the results to the city manager. Each discharge point to the POTW shall be sampled and reported individually. 
(3)	Sample types. Where representative samples are required to be taken, a user shall take a minimum of four (4) grab samples for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques. The city manager may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city manager that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. If flow-proportional sampling is waived, samples may instead be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques, or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples, if the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
(4)	Approval of sampling methods, equipment and location required. Users shall submit a written description of the specific sampling method, sampling equipment, and sampling location to the city for approval by the city manager. Users discharging as of the effective date of this division shall obtain approval within ninety (90) days of that date. For new sources, approval shall be obtained prior to commencement of the discharge. Except as otherwise authorized by this division and approved by the city manager, industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall conduct their sampling and monitoring at the end of each process waste stream (or immediately following the pretreatment associated with each process waste stream, if pretreatment is provided for the waste stream). 
(5)	Costs of sampling and analyses. All samples shall be taken and analyzed at the sole cost of the user. 
(6)	Self-monitoring. Except as otherwise provided by this division, self-monitoring shall be conducted by each user to insure compliance with all applicable requirements of this division and other applicable laws and regulation. A user performing its own sampling shall submit the samples for analysis to a laboratory approved by the city (which may include the user's own laboratory). If the user uses its own laboratory for the analysis, the user shall send a split sample to an independent laboratory at least once per year as a quality control check. If a user performs its own sampling and analysis, the city may also take and cause to be analyzed up to four (4) daily composite samples or up to four (4) grab samples per day, for up to four (4) days in any calendar month, at the sole cost of the user. A user performing its own sampling shall record the date when a sample is taken, start time, stop time, sample location, sampler programming information, and persons involved in the sampling. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except that the user shall not be required to resample if (a) the city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month, or (b) the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of the sampling which indicates the violation. 
(7)	Sampling and analysis performed by city. The sampling and analysis required by this division may be performed by the city in lieu of the user, as determined necessary and appropriate by the city manager. The city shall provide the user with copies of analytical results prepared by the city. If the city performs the required sampling and analysis for a user, the user shall pay a sampling fee to the city to fully reimburse the city for the sampling, including administrative and overhead costs. The city may contract with an independent firm to perform the sampling and analysis and the user shall fully reimburse the city for amounts paid by the city to the firm. 
(8)	Split samples. If requested, the city shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by a user. A user shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by the city if the user requests a split sample within fourteen (14) days after the sample is taken. If possible, split samples shall be provided at the time the sample is taken. 
(9)	Maintenance, repair and calibration of equipment. A user who is performing self-monitoring, or the city if performing sampling and monitoring in lieu of a user, shall contract with an independent company to maintain, repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow measurement equipment and instruments used to monitor the user. The maintenance, repair, and calibration shall be performed as often as necessary to ensure that monitoring data is accurate and representative, but in no event less frequently than twice in a calendar year at reasonable intervals. The city, in any event, may inspect and test a user's flow meters at reasonable times. 
(10)	Required sampling structures and devices. The city may require any user to install at each discharge point a suitable control structure (such as a manhole or sampling vault) and necessary measuring and sampling devices to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the quantity, composition, and concentrations of discharges to the POTW, including sampling and measuring of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The control structure and devices shall be constructed and installed at the user's expense in accordance with plans submitted to the city manager and with all applicable local construction standards and specification. The control structure and devices shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe and accessible to POTW personnel during all reasonable times and so as to provide accurate and representative monitoring data. The control structure shall be located on the user's premises, provided that if a location on the premises would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, the city manager may permit the structure to be located in the public street or sidewalk if it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The complexity of the required control structure or devices may vary with sampling requirements determined necessary by the city manager to protect the POTW and to comply with applicable laws and regulation. The control structure and monitoring facilities shall be constructed by the user within ninety (90) days of written notification to the user by the city that the structure and facility are required. If a user fails to install or maintain a required structure or device, the city may do so at the expense of the user. Samples shall be taken at the control structure. In the absence of a suitable control structure as required by this section, samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. 
(c)	Reporting and notice requirements. All industrial users shall comply with the reporting and notice requirements provided by this section, as follows: 
(1)	Reports by industrial users regarding categorical pretreatment standards and requirements.

(3)	Notice by user of potential problems (40 CFR 403.12(f); MAC 323.2310(5)). All industrial users, whether or not subject to categorical pretreatment standards, shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges by the user that could cause problems to the POTW, including, without limitation, slug loadings, or that exceed a discharge prohibition or limitation provided by this division. 
(4)	Notice by user of violation of pretreatment standards (40 CFR 403.12(g)(2); MAC 323.2310(6)(b)). If sampling performed by an industrial user to demonstrate compliance with applicable pretreatment standards indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation and perform any additional sampling required under MAC 323.2310(6)(b). 
(5)	Notice by user of changed discharge or change in user status (40 CFR 403.12(j); MAC 323.2310(9)). All industrial users shall promptly notify the city manager in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under section 26-106(c)(6), as required by 40 CFR 403.12(j) and MAC 323.2310(9). If the change in discharge may convert an industrial user into a significant industrial user, the user shall promptly notify the city manager. 
(6)	Notice by user regarding wastes which are otherwise hazardous (40 CFR 403.12(p). Any industrial user that discharges to the POTW a substance which, if disposed of other than by discharge to the POTW, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261 or under the rules promulgated under Part 111 of NREPA shall notify the city manager, the U.S. EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the Chief of the Waste and Hazardous Materials Division of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment of the discharge as required by 40 CFR 403.12(p) and MAC 323.2310(15). 
(7)	Notice by user of installation of new pretreatment facilities. Within five (5) days after completing installation of new pretreatment facilities, an industrial user shall notify the city manager in writing of the time and date when it intends to commence operation of the new facilities, and the identity of the person who will conduct any tests to be performed. The pretreatment facilities shall not be placed in regular operation until adequate tests have been conducted to establish that the discharges will comply with the requirements of this division. Upon prior written request by the city manager, the user shall allow a representative of the POTW to observe the tests at the time they are conducted. The cost of the tests shall be paid by the user. 
(8)	Other reports and notices required by this division or by other applicable laws and regulations.

If subsequent to the required annual submission of this information, changes are made in the designation of the person(s) in charge, the chemicals stored, used or manufactured, the user's discharge, or the user's premises, the user shall within fifteen (15) days of making the change (or sooner as otherwise required by this division) provide the city manager with written notice of the changes made. 
(6)	Segregation of wastewaters requiring pretreatment. Industrial users shall segregate wastewaters requiring pretreatment (including, without limitation, spent concentrates, toxics, and high strength organic wastes) as necessary to prevent pollutants from interfering with or passing through the POTW. All sludges generated by pretreatment shall be used or disposed of only as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. 
(7)	Spill prevention plan. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of materials which may interfere with the POTW by developing a spill prevention plan. If the materials of concern are on the state critical materials list, the user shall develop and submit to the city manager for approval a Pollution Incident Prevention ("PIP") Plan in accordance with the requirements of Part 31 of NREPA, Water Resources Protection, MCL 324.3101 et seq., as amended, and rules promulgated thereunder. Detailed spill prevention and/or PIP plans certified by a state-licensed professional engineer, including the facilities and the operating procedures, shall be submitted to the city manager within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this division for an existing source, or thirty (30) days prior to the date of discharge for a new source. 
(8)	Spill containment requirements. Each industrial user must provide and maintain at the user's expense spill containment structures (including diking, curbing or other appropriate structures) adequate to protect all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges to the POTW of any pollutants or discharges regulated by this division. The containment or curbing shall be sufficient to contain not less than one hundred fifty (150) percent of liquid polluting material stored or used, unless a lesser containment area or alternate control measures are approved by the city manager. The containment area shall be constructed so that no liquid polluting material can escape from the area by gravity through building sewers, drains, or otherwise directly or indirectly into the POTW. All floor drains within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill troughs and sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. Emergency containment protection shall also be provided for storage tanks which may be serviced by commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas. Solid pollutants shall be located in security areas designed to prevent the loss of the materials to the POTW. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide the protection required by this section shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be approved by the city manager before construction. Construction of approved containment facilities for existing sources shall be completed within the time period specified by the city manager. No new source shall be permitted to discharge to the POTW until emergency containment facilities have been approved and constructed as required by this section. The city manager may order an industrial user to take interim measures for emergency containment, if circumstances require. 
(9)	Posting of accidental discharge information. All industrial users shall permanently and prominently post a clearly legible set of instructions in the area where the user manages wastewater so that the applicable reporting and notice requirements (including telephone numbers) are made known and are immediately available to the user's employees. In addition, all industrial users shall instruct their employees on the applicable reporting and notice requirements of this section. 
(10)	Notice of accidental discharge. In the case of an accidental discharge, an industrial user shall immediately notify the city manager of the incident by telephone. The notification shall include available information regarding the location of the discharge, its volume, duration, constituents, loading and concentrations, corrective actions required and other available information as necessary to determine what impact the discharge may have on the POTW. A written notification providing the same and any additional available information shall also be provided by the user to the city manager within five (5) days of the incident. 
(11)	Slug control plan. The city manager shall evaluate each significant industrial user at least once every two (2) years, and other industrial users as necessary, to determine whether such user needs a plan to control slug discharges. If the city manager determines that a slug control plan is needed, then the plan shall contain at least the following elements: 
a.	A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
b.	A description of stored materials;
c.	The procedures for immediately notifying the city manager of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate any discharge prohibition, limitation or requirement under this division, and procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days of the discharge; 
d.	The procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(h)	Upsets. The provisions of this section govern upset liability and responsibility, and the conditions necessary to establish the affirmative defense of upset. 
(1)	Upset liability. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if all of the requirements of section 26-106(h)(2), below, are met. However, in the event of an upset, the user may still be liable for surcharges for exceeding applicable discharge limitations as provided by this division. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(2)	Conditions necessary to demonstrate upset. A user seeking to establish the affirmative defense of upset must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.	An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.	The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.	The user has submitted the following information to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
1.	A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.	The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.	The steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)	User responsibility in case of upset. The user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and other applicable limits upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(i)	Bypass. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's pretreatment facility is prohibited, except as otherwise expressly provided by this section. 
(1)	Bypass prohibited. The bypass of industrial wastes from any portion of an industrial user's facility is prohibited unless: 
a.	Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime; and 
c.	The industrial user submitted notices required under this section.
(2)	Required notices. 
a.	If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
b.	An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(3)	POTW approved bypass. The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it meets the condition in section 26-106(i)(1)a., b. and c., above. 
(j)	Additional affirmative defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions and specific prohibitions as provided by 40 CFR 403.5(a)(2) if the user can demonstrate that all of the conditions necessary to establish the defense under 40 CFR 403.5(a)(2)(i) and (ii) are met. However, even if the affirmative defense is established, the user may still be liable for surcharges for exceeding applicable discharge limitations as provided by this division. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the native defenses provided for by 40 CFR 403.5(a)(2) shall have the burden of proof. 
(k)	Preliminary treatment facilities. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater as provided by this section shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be approved by the city manager before construction of the facility. The review of pretreatment facility plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to produce a discharge which meets the requirements of this division. Any subsequent changes proposed in the pretreatment facilities or methods of operation shall be reported to the city manager and shall require approval by the city manager prior to initiation of the changes by the user. 
(l)	Application. Unless specified otherwise, this section shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW.

Sec. 26-107. - Sewer charges and surcharges. 
(a)	Purposes. This section provides for the assessment, payment and collection of charges and fees by users of the POTW to reimburse the city for the costs of administering this division. 
(b)	Basic sewer rates and charges. 
(1)	The complete sewage works of the city, including all main and lateral sewers, and all facilities, instrumentalities or properties used or useful in the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial waste, as same now exists, and as may hereafter be improved and expanded, shall be operated and maintained on a rate basis. 
(2)	To pay for the cost of O&M, repair, and enlargement of the sewage works there is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having any sewer connection with the sewage works system of the city and the owners of such premises shall pay the sewage service rates and charges as are determined by resolution of the city council. The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant occupying the property serviced, but those billings shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event payment is not made as required by this division, except as herein specified. The owners of property served which are occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether the rates and charges have been paid by the tenants, provided that the examination shall be made at the office in the which the records are kept and during the regular business hours of the office. In a case where a tenant is responsible for the payment of the charges and the city is so notified in writing, the notice to include a true copy of the lease of the affected premises, then the charges shall not become a lien against the premises after the date of notice. In the event of filing of the notice, the city may elect to render no further service to the premises until a cash deposit in the amount to be determined by resolution of the city council is made as security for the payment of the charges. 
(3)	Each sewer service charge, fee or surcharge levied pursuant to this division is hereby made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by the connection to the sewage works, and if the same is not paid within thirty (30) days after it shall become due and payable, it shall be certified by the city clerk to the city assessor. The charges shall then be collected as other city taxes are collected. The official record of this city shall constitute notice of penalty and of a lien. Whenever any person shall become delinquent in the payment of any sewer service charge, the city may sue in an appropriate court of law to collect the amount so due. Commencement of an action to collect delinquent charges shall not destroy the lien upon the premises as provided by this section. In addition, the city shall have the right to shut off and discontinue the supply of water to any premises for nonpayment of the sewer service charges when due. 
(4)	At least biennially, the city shall cause to be reviewed the rates and charges, including all charges for O&M, applicable to the sewage works and shall adjust the rates to ensure that the costs of the sewage works shall be recovered from the customers proportionately to the cost of providing service to them. 
(5)	At least annually, enclosed with billing information, the city shall inform all users of the sewage works of the percentage of rates and charges assessed that are attributable to the O&M costs of the sewage works. 
(6)	To provide for the payment of fees from users of the sewage works to compensate the city for the cost of administration of the pretreatment program established by this division, charges and surcharges for the use of the sewage works, all penalties, fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures, fees for permit application, fees for filing appeals as provided in this division, fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction, and any other fees authorized by this division or deemed necessary by the city council shall be set by resolution of the city council. 
(c)	Surcharges. 
(1)	Applicability of surcharges. Any user exceeding the discharge prohibition, limitations and requirements as provided by section 26-105, or as provided by any applicable order or special agreement, shall be subject to the imposition of one (1) or more surcharges as provided by this section to reimburse the POTW for any costs or expenses (direct or indirect) the POTW may incur in handling or treating the discharge (or which may be imposed upon the city), where the exceedance of applicable limits causes or contributes to those costs or expenses. All exceedances of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements shall constitute a violation of this division, subject to applicable fines, penalties and other enforcement action provided by this division. In no event shall the imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this division. 
(2)	Surcharge rates. Surcharge rates shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
(3)	Determination of amount of surcharge. The city manager shall calculate the amount of the surcharge to be assessed against a user based upon samples of a type and frequency as required by the city manager taken and analyzed by the user and/or the city at the user's expense, and based upon additional factors including, without limitation, the following: 
a.	The volume, composition, strength or duration of the discharge.
b.	The degree of success the POTW is able to achieve in minimizing or mitigating the impacts of the discharge. 
c.	The toxicity, degradability, treatability, and dispersal characteristics of the discharge.
d.	Costs incurred by the city to treat the discharges, including sludge handling and disposal. 
e.	The amount of any fines and penalties imposed on the city as a result of the discharge, including the city's costs of defense (including actual attorneys' fees, consultant fees, and sampling and analytical fees) of actions brought or threatened against the city by the state or federal government or any third party. 
f.	Any damages to the POTW or damages imposed upon the city by the state or federal government or third parties as a result of the discharge. 
g.	Other factors related to costs or expenses incurred by the city or claims brought against the city as a result of the discharge.

6.	Inability of a user (or a proposed user) to comply with the discharge prohibitions and limitations as provided by this division or by an applicable order of determination or special agreement. 
c.	Order to cease discharge within a time certain. The city manager may issue an order to show cause why an order to cease and desist by a certain time and date should not be issued. The proposed time for any required remedial action shall be specified in the order to show cause. The order may also contain conditions as determined appropriate by the city manager. Failure to pay applicable fees or to comply with any term or condition of an enforcement order, an order of determination, a special agreement, or provision of this division constitutes sufficient cause for an order under this section. 
d.	Order to effect pretreatment. The city manager may issue an order to show cause why a user should not be required to pretreat as required by this division or by any order of determination or special agreement. Any user subject to an order to pretreat shall prepare a plan to pretreat its discharge so that the discharge complies with the requirements of the order and this division. The plan shall be submitted to the city manager within a reasonable period specified in the order. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with good engineering practice and shall state whether construction is necessary, as well as identify measures which can be implemented without construction. The plan shall contain a schedule of compliance for the completion of each of the various phases necessary to implement full pretreatment as provided by section 26-106(a)(13). The schedule of compliance must be approved by the city manager. 
e.	Order to perform affirmative action. The city manager may issue an order requiring a user to perform any action required under this division (or an order to show cause why the user should not be required to perform the action), including, without limitation, requiring a user to submit samples; to install sampling, metering and monitoring equipment; to submit reports; to permit access for inspection, sampling, testing, monitoring and investigations; to reduce or eliminate a discharge or pollutants in a discharge; or to pay fees or other applicable charges. 
f.	Order to show cause; show cause hearing. The city manager may issue the user to appear and explain any noncompliance with the requirements of this division or any permit, order, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made under this division, and to show cause why more severe enforcement action against the user should not go forward. A show cause hearing shall be held within ten (10) days after the order to show cause was issued, as follows: 
1.	The hearing shall be conducted and evidence shall be taken by the city manager or by an authorized representative designated by the city manager. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in the hearing. If the hearing is conducted by an authorized representative of the city manager, the city manager shall thereafter be provided with a written report of the hearing, including transcripts, any other evidence, and any recommendations to the city manager for further action. 
2.	Any testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded. A copy of the transcript of the hearing shall be made available at cost to any person upon payment of applicable charges. 
3.	After reviewing the evidence taken at the hearing, the city manager shall decide whether further enforcement action is required and, if so, the nature and extent of that further action, including, without limitation, the issuance of any order or the imposition of any fines, fees, surcharges or penalties, as authorized by this division. 
(3)	Immediate response to order may be required. Any user issued an order by the city manager as provided by this section to immediately suspend its discharge to the POTW shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge using whatever means are necessary to do so, or take any other action as required by the order. If the user fails to comply voluntarily with the order to immediately suspend its discharge, the city shall take any action determined necessary as authorized by this division, including immediate suspension of water service and/or the severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to public health, safety or the environment. The city manager may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon satisfactory proof or other demonstration provided by the user that the noncomplying discharge has been eliminated or will not reoccur. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the noncomplying discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. 
(4)	Noncompliance due to factors beyond user's control. If noncompliance with an order is unintentional and temporary and due to factors beyond the reasonable control of a user, and the user can demonstrate the conditions necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by section 26-106(h), the city manager may (but shall not be required to) modify the order or take other actions as determined appropriate under the circumstances. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for noncompliance with an order to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(5)	Amendment, suspension and revocation of orders. An order shall be subject to amendment, suspension or revocation as determined appropriate by the city manager. Notice of the amendment, suspension or revocation shall be served upon the user in the same manner as notice was provided for the original order. An amendment, suspension or revocation of an order shall be subject to the same procedures for review and appeal as the original issuance of the order, as provided by this division.

Except as otherwise provided in this division, a person who violates any provision of this division (including, but not limited to, any notice, order, permit, decision, determination, or agreement entered into, promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under this division) is responsible for a municipal civil infraction, subject to payment of a civil fine of no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each infraction, plus costs and other sanctions. Each day on which a violation of this division shall occur or continue is a separate and distinct violation, as set forth in subsection (n) below. The fine as authorized by this section may be assessed in addition to any other charge, fee, surcharge, penalty or fine authorized or levied under this division, as set forth in subsection (o) below. 
(2)	Subsequent offenses; increased fines. Increased fines may be imposed for subsequent offenses committed by any person. As used in this section, the term "subsequent offense" means a second or any subsequent municipal civil infraction violation of any requirement or provision (including either the same or a different requirement or provision) of this division committed by a person for which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be responsible. The increased fine for a subsequent offense under this division shall be as follows: 
a.	The fine for any offense that is a second offense shall be no more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), plus costs. 
b.	The fine for any offense that is a third offense or any subsequent repeat offense shall be no more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) plus costs. 
(3)	Amount of fines. 
a.	Factors in determining amount of fine. In determining the amount of a fine, subject to the maximum fine amounts specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the city manager shall consider the following: the type, nature, severity, frequency, duration, preventability, potential and actual effect, and economic benefit to the violator (such as delayed or avoided costs or competitive advantage) of a violation; the violator's recalcitrance or efforts to comply; the economic impacts of the fine on the violator; and such other matters as justice may require. A violator shall bear the burden of demonstrating the presence and degree of any mitigating factors to be considered by the city manager in determining the amount of a fine. However, mitigating factors shall not be considered unless the city manager determines that the violator has made all good faith efforts to correct and terminate all violations. The fact that a fine may cause severe financial damage or put a violator out of business shall not be determinative of the amount of a fine. 
b.	Failure to pay fine by applicable deadline. Failure to pay a fine in full by the applicable payment deadline as specified in any notice or order issued by the city constitutes as separate violation of this division, subject to payment of the following additional amounts for each day past a deadline that the fine is not paid in full: 
1.	For late payment of a fine assessed for a first offense: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day past payment deadline for offenses under subsections (1) or (2) of this section. 
2.	For late payment of a fine assessed for a second offense: One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day past payment deadline for offenses under subsections (1) or (2) of this section. 
3.	For late payment of a fine assessed for a third offense (or any subsequent offense): Three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per day past payment deadline for offenses under subsections (1) or (2) of this section. 
c.	Municipal civil infraction notices. If a fine is assessed under this section, the city manager shall cause a written notice of assessment to be served on the violator as provided by section 26-108(f). A copy of the schedule of fines as set forth above shall be posted at the city municipal ordinance violations bureau. 
(4)	Any person aggrieved by the assessment of an administrative fine under this section may request an informal hearing before the city manager, or a formal hearing before the sewer board of appeals, as provided by section 26-109 
(5)	Fines assessed under this section that have not been paid in full within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of assessment shall be added to the next scheduled service bill and shall be paid and collected along with other rates, charges, fines or penalties as provided by section 26-107 
(f)	Service of notices of violation, orders of enforcement, and notices of assessment. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this division, all orders, notices of violation and notices of assessments shall be served upon persons and shall contain the information as provided by this section. 
(1)	Service. Service shall be by personal delivery or certified mail (return receipt requested), addressed to the user, alleged violator or other person, as applicable. The person served shall sign and date the order or notice and shall return the signed original copy to the city; provided, that the failure to do so shall not affect the person's obligation to comply with the order or notice.

i.	The date and time the order or notice was issued.
(3)	Request for additional information. A person served may request additional information from the city manager regarding the contents or requirements as provided by any order or notice. However, a request for additional information shall not extend the time for compliance with an order or notice. 
(g)	Control authority enforcement response plan. The city manager is authorized to develop and implement a control authority enforcement response (CAER) plan as required by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5). The CAER plan shall provide procedures for the POTW to investigate and respond to instances of noncompliance by industrial users. The CAER plan and any associated regulation developed by the city manager shall become effective upon approval by resolution of the city council. 
(h)	Publication of list of users in significant noncompliance. The city shall publish once per year in the largest daily newspaper in the city, a list of users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.

(n)	Continuing offense. Each act of violation, and each day or portion of a day that a violation of this division, or of any permit, order, notice or agreement issued or entered into under this division is permitted to exist or occur, constitutes a separate offense and shall be punishable as provided by this division. 
(o)	Cumulative remedies. The imposition of a single penalty, fine, order, damage, or surcharge upon any person for a violation of this division, or of any permit, order, notice, decision, determination or agreement issued or entered into under this division, shall not preclude the imposition by the city or a court of competent jurisdiction of a combination of any or all of those sanctions and remedies or additional sanctions and remedies with respect to the same violation, consistent with applicable statutory limitations on penalty amounts. A criminal citation and prosecution of a criminal action against a person shall not be dependent upon or held in abeyance during any civil, judicial, or city administrative proceeding, conference, or hearing regarding the person. 
(p)	Judicial relief. The city manager is hereby empowered, with the city attorney, to institute legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction for the abatement of any nuisance, and to seek relief for violation of this chapter, or of any permit, order, notice or agreement issued or entered into under this division.

(b)	Hearings before the sewer board of appeals. This section governs formal appeals to the sewer board of appeals from actions taken by the city manager or other authorized representatives of the city in administering this division. 
(1)	Sewer board of appeals; duties. To ensure that the provisions of this division are reasonably applied and substantial justice done in instances where unnecessary hardship would result from carrying out the strict letter of this division, the city council of the City of Grandville shall serve as a sewer board of appeals ("SBA"). The duty of the SBA shall be to consider appeals from decisions of the city manager or other authorized representatives of the city manager charged with enforcement of this division, and to determine in particular cases whether any deviation from strict enforcement of this division will violate the purposes of this division or endanger the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or the POTW. 
(2)	Notice of appeal required. An appeal from any final action of the city manager or other authorized representative (including any order, decision, determination, citation, charge, fee, surcharge, penalty, fine or other action, but not including any requirement or action taken as required by state or federal law or regulation) may be made to the city council, acting as the sewer board of appeals, within thirty (30) days from the date of the action. The appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved by the action. The appellant shall file a notice of appeal with the city manager and with the SBA. The notice of appeal shall specify the grounds for the appeal. Failure to file a timely notice of appeal shall be deemed to be a waiver of the appeal. 
(3)	Summary of previous action. Prior to the SBA hearing on the appeal, the city manager shall transmit to the SBA a written summary of all previous action taken in connection with the action being appealed. The SBA may, at its discretion, request the city manager or other city officials or employees to provide further information regarding the action which is the subject of the appeal. 
(4)	Notice; decision. The SBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, shall give due notice of the appeal to interested parties, and shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time. Within the limits of its jurisdiction, the SBA may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, the action appealed from, or may make any order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its opinion, ought to be made in the case under consideration. To that end, the SBA shall have all the powers of the official from whom the appeal is taken. The final disposition of the appeal shall be in the form of a resolution by the SBA, either reversing, modifying, or affirming, in whole or in part, the action of the city manager. The action appealed from shall not be reversed or modified, in whole or in part, and the SBA shall not otherwise find in favor of the appellant unless at least four (4) members of the SBA concur. The decision of the SBA shall be final. 
(5)	Meetings of SBA. The SBA shall meet at the times as the board may determine. There shall be a fixed place of meeting and all meetings shall be open to the public in accordance with applicable laws. The SBA shall adopt its own rules of procedure and keep a record of its proceedings, setting forth findings of fact, the action taken by the board, and the vote of each member upon each question considered. The presence of at least five (5) members of the SBA shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. 
(c)	Effect of appeal on payment of charges, penalties, fines, fees. All service charges, penalties, fines, fees, surcharges, costs or expenses outstanding during any appeal process shall be due and payable to the city. Upon resolution of any appeal, the city shall, if required, adjust the amounts due and payable accordingly. However, the adjustments made upon resolution of an appeal shall be limited to the previous one (1) year's billing unless otherwise directed by court order. The SBA shall also have the responsibility to terminate wastewater treatment services if a corrective course of action is not taken or if service charges, penalties, fines, fees, surcharges, costs or expenses are not paid. 
(d)	Finality of administrative action. If an informal or formal hearing is not demanded within the periods specified by this section, the administrative action shall be deemed final. In the event either or both hearings are demanded, the action shall be suspended until a final determination has been made, except for orders to immediately cease and desist discharge or to terminate sewer services, or other emergency orders or actions where a suspension or delay might endanger human health, the environment or the POTW, or except as otherwise expressly provided by this division. 
(e)	Appeal to circuit court. Appeals from the determination of the SBA may be made to the Circuit Court for the County of Kent as provided by law.

(1)	By personal delivery of order to the person responsible;
(2)	By leaving the order with some person of suitable age and discretion upon the premises;
(3)	By affixing a copy of the order to the door at the entrance of the premises in violation;
(4)	By mailing a copy of the order to the last known address of the owner of the premises by certified mail; or 
(5)	By publishing a copy of the order in a newspaper of local circulation for three (3) successive weeks. 
(c)	Time for compliance. The order required by this section shall set forth a time limit for compliance, dependent upon the hazard and danger created by the violation. In cases of extreme danger to persons or public property, the city forester shall have the authority to require compliance immediately upon service of the order. 
(d)	Appeal from order. A person to whom an order is directed shall have the right to appeal to the city council by filing such appeal in writing with the city clerk within forty-eight (48) hours of the service of such order. Unless the order is revoked or modified, it shall remain in full force and be obeyed by the person to whom directed, within two (2) days after an appeal shall have been determined. 
(e)	Failure to comply. When a person to whom an order is directed shall fail to comply within the specified time, the city forester shall remedy the condition or contract with others for such purpose and charge the cost thereof to the person to whom the order is directed. The person remedying a condition under a contract made pursuant to this subsection shall be authorized to enter the premises for that purpose. 
(f)	Special assessment. If the cost of remedying a condition is not paid within ninety (90) days after receipt of a statement therefor from the city forester, such cost shall be levied against the property upon which the hazard exists, as a special assessment. The levy of such assessment shall not affect the liability of the person to whom the order is directed to other remedies, penalties, or fines as provided in this article. Such special assessment shall be certified by the city forester to the city treasurer and shall thereupon become and be a lien upon such property, shall be included in the next tax bill rendered to the owner thereof unless paid before, and shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes against such property.

and other public facilities; to facilitate adequate and efficient 


provision for transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility needs; and to promote public health, safety, and welfare; and for those purposes to divide the city into districts; to prescribe penalties for the violation thereof; and to repeal 
conflicting ordinances. 
Section 1.2. Short title. 

This ordinance shall be known as The Zoning Ordinance of 
2010 and may be cited as such. 
Section 1.3. Purpose. 
As they are interpreted and applied, the provisions of this ordinance shall be the minimum requirements adopted to promote public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. 

The provisions of this title are intended, among other things, 
to protect the lands, water, and other natural resources of the community by encouraging uses that are best suited to the capabilities and characteristics of those resources and limiting their improper use; to promote orderly development in accordance with the citys master plan, as amended; to facilitate economical municipal water and sewer services, 
adequate traffic capacity, recreational areas, schools, and 

other public requirements; to provide adequate light, air, and 
healthful conditions in residential, commercial, and industrial areas; to promote convenient and safe access; to protect 
against fire and other dangers; to avoid undue concentrations 
of people by regulating the height and bulk of buildings; to establish and require adequate yards, courts, and other open spaces; to regulate and restrict the location of all uses, 
trades, industries, and buildings in relation to safe traffic 
and pedestrian movement; and to achieve stability in the expenditure of funds for public improvements and services. 
Section 1.4. Scope. 
This ordinance does not repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other 
laws or ordinances, except those specifically repealed by 
this ordinance, or of any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed, or other private agreement. Where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions than are imposed or required by existing laws or ordinances, or by rules, regulations, or permits, or by private restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall control.

Ordinary repairs and normal maintenance may be performed on any structure devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming use, or on any nonconforming structure, including repair or replacement of nonbearing walls or 
partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the 
expense of such repairs and maintenance do not exceed, during any 12 consecutive month period, 50 percent of the 


General Provisions for All Districts state-equalized value of the use or structure, exclusive of been spent in reliance upon prior zoning regulations, but, 

the value of the land. 
Any nonconforming structure, or part thereof, declared 

to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the 
public safety, may be strengthened or restored to a safe condition. However, repairs, maintenance, or other restoration of a nonconforming structure, as permitted by this section or any other provisions of this ordinance, shall not cause the nonconforming use or structure to be enlarged, expanded, extended, increased, relocated, or changed to any degree as prohibited by this section. 


I. Prior commencement of construction. 
This section shall not be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any structure for which, prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, a building permit was obtained and actual construction was lawfully commenced on the site.  Actual construction of the structure must have been commenced within six months of the issuance of the building permit, and must thereafter be diligently 
carried on to completion according to the plans filed 
with the building permit application, without any period of suspension or abandonment of work in excess of six months. 
For purposes of this section, the commencement of actual construction means work of a substantial character by way of preparation for an actual use of the premises. The actual use must be apparent and manifested by a tangible change in the land, as opposed to merely intended or contemplated work by the property owner. In this regard, preliminary operations, such as the ordering of plans, surveying the land, grading the land, clearing of trees and 
debris, and the removal of old buildings, are insufficient. 
The test in each case is not how much money may have rather, whether there has been any tangible change in the land itself by excavation and construction, such as the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. 
Uses and structures that do not meet all of the requirements of this subsection shall be considered nonconforming uses and structures for purposes of this section. 


J.	 Change of ownership or occupation. 
The ownership, occupation, or management of an existing nonconforming use or nonconforming structure may be changed, but the use or structure shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended, increased, relocated, or changed as otherwise prohibited by this article. 


K.	 Elimination of nonconforming use or structure. 
The city of Grandville may acquire by purchase, condemnation, or other means, private property, or an interest in private property, for the removal of any nonconforming use or structure, in accordance with the Zoning Act and all other applicable state and federal laws. 




Floodplain Regulations 




City of Grandville Zoning Ordinance 

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 4.1. Purpose and intent. 
Certain areas in Grandville are subject to periodic or seasonal 
inundation which may result in flood damage to property, 
health and safety hazards, or loss of life; disruption of commercial, industrial, municipal, and other economic activities; and adverse effects upon the general welfare of the community. 
A. 	Purpose. This section seeks to promote the public health, 


safety, and general welfare, and to minimize flood damage by: 
1. 	Restricting or prohibiting uses that are dangerous to 
health, safety, and property in time of flood or which 
cause increased flood heights and velocities; 
2.	 Requiring uses vulnerable to floods, including public uses, to be constructed to protect against flood 
damage; and 


3. 	Protecting individuals from buying lands prone to 
flooding that are unsuited for intended purposes. 
B. 	Scope. All lands prone to flooding that adjoin the Grand River, Buck Creek, and other properties as described in the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Grandville, dated 
March 16, 1982, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate 
Maps and Flood Boundary Floodway Maps, as amended 
from time to time, are subject to these regulations. Such 
areas of the city of Grandville are divided into floodway 


areas and flood fringe areas, with boundaries as shown 
on the previously described maps. Within these areas, the provisions of this article shall take precedence over any 
conflicting ordinances or codes. Uses otherwise permitted 
by the various regulations of this ordinance, but that are 
located in the floodway or flood fringe areas, shall not 
be permitted unless also permitted herein and developed 


in accordance with the regulations of this section. 
Uses permitted by this article, but not permitted in the underlying zone district are not authorized. 
Section 4.2. Definitions. 
As used in this article, the following words and phrases shall 
have the meanings provided by this section: 
Base flood. A flood having a one percent chance of being 

equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Floodway area. That portion of the floodplain carrying deeper fast-moving floodwaters, considered to be the 50-year flood area. 
Flood fringe area. The portion of the floodplain that carries 
shallower, slow moving waters, considered to be lands 
between the 50-year and 100-year flood areas. 
Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings 
or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, 
excavation, or drilling operations. 
Section 4.3. Permitted uses in the flood fringe 
areas. 
A. 	Development that is a permitted use in the underlying zoning districts shall be permitted in flood fringe areas provided the following conditions are met: 
1. New construction and substantial improvements of 
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, 
including the basement, elevated to or above the base 
flood level. 
2. New construction and substantial improvements of 
nonresidential structures shall either: 
a.	 Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level; or 


Floodplain Regulations 

b.	 Be constructed such that below the base flood capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds. 

level, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify 
that the standards of this subpart are satisfied, and that the floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand flood depths, pressures, velocities, 
impacts and uplift forces, and other factors 
associated with a base flood in the location of the structure. Certification shall be submitted to the city 
manager or designee along with the application for building permit and shall indicate the elevation to 
which the structure is floodproofed.

The danger that materials may be swept into other lands to the injury of others; 

2.	 
The danger to life and property due to flooding or 


erosion damage; 
3. 	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its 
contents to flood damage, and the effect of such 

damage on the individual owner; 
4. 	
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 

5. 	
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 

6. 	
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 6.1. Purpose and Intent. 	Section 6.2. Table of Uses. 
A. 	R1-A, R1-B and R1-C Single Family Residential Districts. The single family conventional zoning districts contain a predominance of detached dwellings on individual lots or parcels, each housing only one family. These districts preserve single family residential areas and promote and encourage a suitable and safe environment for single family residential living. Uses that are accessory or ancillary to one-family dwellings, such as home occupations and storage buildings are also permitted, subject to the requirements contained in this ordinance. 

B. 	R2-A Two Family Residential District. The R2-A district includes portions of Grandvilles original plats and neighborhoods that are located north of Prairie Street and allows a mix of one and two-family residences in certain older, established areas. Two-family dwellings in this district are typically the result of converted. older single family homes. 

C. 	R2-B Two Family Residential District. The R2-B district achieves the same character, stability, and quality residential environment as that for single family districts, but at a slightly higher population density. The R2-B district accommodates one or two-family dwellings in a newer area of Grandville, generally south of Buck Creek. The R2-B district has a limited application, serving primarily as a transitional zoning district between single family residential and more intensive use districts. 

The following abbreviations apply to the Table of Uses for the 
Single Family Residential Districts:

A. R3-A Moderate Density Residential District. The 
R-3A Moderate Density Residential District accommodates 
moderate density residential development and encourages a mix of housing types (including multiple-family residential), occurring at higher densities than conventional one-family subdivisions, but not with lower quality 
standards. Moderate density residential development 

must be served by public utilities, community services, 
and/or amenities, and must be accessed by arterial or collector streets. In certain instances the district may serve as a transition area between one-family residential and either nonresidential uses or high density residential development. 

B. R3-B, Multiple Family Residential District. The 
R-3B Multiple Family Residential District accommodates 

higher density multiple family dwellings, including 
apartments, groups of apartments in single ownership, two-family dwellings, planned unit  development projects in accordance with Article 11 of this ordinance, one-family dwellings, and institutional uses. 

C. RMH Manufactured Home Park Residential District. 
The RMH Manufactured Home Park Residential District 
accommodates manufactured home dwellings within a manufactured home park, as regulated by applicable 
State of Michigan statutes and administrative rules. The

Section 8.1. Purpose and Intent 
A. 	OS-1 Office/Service District. The OS-1 Office/Service District accommodates a variety of business, professional, 
executive, and administrative office uses, sports or club 

buildings, and related activities, as well as a limited range of personal services. Uses in this district are to be located in close proximity to major streets and by virtue of their relatively low level of intensity, unobtrusive hours of operation, and architecture,  they may often serve as 
a transition between more intensive uses and residential uses. 
B. OS-2 Regional Office/Service District. The OS-2 
Regional Office/Service District provides a limited range of office and service activities along and near Rivertown Parkway. The district encourages office and certain service 
uses, but discourages general commercial activities. Permitted uses are appropriate to allow a transition 


between residentially planned areas and the traffic 
and higher intensity uses along the Rivertown corridor. The regulations in this article ensure development will occur in a planned, coordinated fashion with regard to infrastructure and site use so as to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; promote economic stability and growth; prevent the encroachment of uses incompatible with the character of the district; and 
promote the efficient movement of traffic. 


C. 	C-1 Commercial Neighborhood Business District. C-1 Commercial Neighborhood Business District accommodates neighborhood shopping and personal service opportunities in close proximity to residential areas. The uses permitted in this district satisfy the need for nondurable convenience goods or personal services as demonstrated by the residential population in the immediate area. By encouraging the consolidation of neighborhood shopping 
and personal service uses in a limited number of locations strip commercial development, and the related impacts on 
traffic flow and resulting congestion, are avoided. 
D. 	C-3 Commercial Highway District. The C-3 Commercial Highway District serves the highway merchandising and servicing needs of Grandville and the surrounding area. These districts are found on regional and principal arterial streets, such as 28th Street and Chicago Drive. 
E.	 C-4 Commercial Shopping Center District. The C-4 Commercial Shopping Center District accommodates planned regional commercial centers that by virtue of their size service not only the city, but also the surrounding market. Such commercial centers are characterized by a single major structure, along with an integrated or planned cluster of retail establishments served by a common parking area. This article facilitate shopping center development in a planned, orderly fashion, so as to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, especially relative to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
F. 	C-5 Commercial Freeway Interchange District. The C-5 Commercial Freeway Interchange District accommodates a variety of uses that are appropriate to freeway interchange locations. Related regulations protect against uncontrolled development and optimize nonresidential land uses. All of this is accomplished while the immediate environment, both existing and proposed, is protected. The district also promotes rational urban design that provides community facilities or infrastructure, employment and retail opportunities, and services to the traveling public in a convenient and attractive manner and encourages creative and imaginative land use and design in a unique setting.

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 10.1. Purpose and Intent 	entertainment, public spaces, residential uses and 
The purpose of form-based Districts is to provide specific regulations to achieve the following: 
A. 	To develop a fully integrated, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented environment with traditional residential neighborhoods and a traditional downtown with buildings 
containing commercial, residential and office uses. 

B. 	To create a synergy of uses within the downtown supporting economic development and redevelopment. 

C.	 To calm traffic, thereby creating a more pedestrian-friendly 
environment and preventing a clustering of auto-oriented uses. 
D. 	To regulate building height and placement to achieve appropriate scale along streets and ensure proper transition between the different areas of the city. 

E.	 To establish clear controls on building form and placement to frame a well-defined public realm comprised of human-

scale streets, neighborhoods and public spaces, all of which contribute to creating a safe, comfortable and livable environment. 
Section 10.2. Form-based districts 
A form-based code is established for the core area of 
Grandville, which is divided into the following districts: 
A.	 PB  Prairie/Barrett District. The Prairie/Barrett District 


supports a quiet single family residential setting, while preserving the traditional development patterns of the area. 
B. 	CBD - Central Business District.  The Central Business District protects the traditional, small town development character of downtown Grandville and enhances a pedestrian-oriented environment.  The 


district accommodates a mix of retail stores, offices, 
related activities that are mutually supporting and serve the needs of the community.  The intent of this district is to encourage a lively social environment and economically viable downtown with a wide variety of uses 
in a pedestrian-oriented and unified setting with shared 
parking. 
Section 10.3. Application of Regulations 
Within the form based districts, all requirements of this 
ordinance shall apply, except as modified by this article.

1. Residential Buildings 

a. Intent. The implementation of the requirements of this District will result in a complementary residential development pattern, ensure that uses are easily accessible, and accommodate certain building projections and variations in design.  By regulating the character of buildings, façades can be located closer to the street and 

sidewalk and be aligned to form a street edge that frames the public realm, while retaining sufficient width for 
people to walk and mingle with neighbors.  Further, new buildings can be designed to blend with existing ones and the character of existing residential areas, as expressed by traditional architecture and residential style entries, 
window openings, and building height, can be maintained and enhanced.

1. Mixed-Use and Commercial Buildings, Apartment Buildings, and Townhouses 
a. Intent. The Requirements of this District provide a compact development pattern, ensure that uses are adjacent to the 
sidewalk, and accommodate variations in architectural character and design. They further support a walkable, pedestrian 
environment that promotes a mix of uses, accessibility to retail and a high quality public realm.  By regulating building elements, 

façades can be aligned along streets and sidewalks to form a street edge that frames the public realm, while retaining a sufficient 
dimension that allows people to comfortably walk two to three abreast. Strong architectural character should be reflected in the 


design of buildings including lintels, windowsills, cornices, transoms, etc., and by traditional storefronts, as expressed by front 
entries, window openings, and minimum building heights. Walls visible from the public right-of-way must include windows and 
architectural features customarily found on the front façade of a building, such as awnings, cornice work, columns, edge detailing 
or other character elements. Prominent and usable public building entrances at the front of the building result in a clearly 


identifiable orientation and façades whose mass is divided by rhythmic architectural elements helps to reduce scale.

when a pedestrian plaza, park, or landscaped front yard, compatible with 
the character of the surrounding area, is provided. 


Walls that face a public street, plaza, green or park shall include windows 
and architectural features customarily found on the front of a building, 

such as awnings, cornice work, edge detailing or decorative finish 
materials. 



There shall be at least one usable front pedestrian entrance from the 
public sidewalk. Design details shall enhance the appearance and 
prominence of main pedestrian entrances to make them recognizable 
from the street and parking areas. 


The requirements for Mixed Use and Commercial Buildings contained in 
this article shall be used as a basis for the design of civic/institutional 
buildings. The planning commission may, however, allow modifications 

based upon unique building requirements and a desire to create 

community landmarks.

12. Where the requirements of this article conflict with any requirements in Article 12, the requirements of this article shall prevail. 

B. 	Administrative Approvals: An administrative approval provides an incentive to applicants who develop projects or sites within form-based districts that fully comply with all of the requirements of this article, without deviations or variances, and do not require site plan review or special land use approval. 
1. 	
The city manager or designee shall have the capacity to make an Administrative Approval. The city manager or designee shall consult with designated representatives of other city departments, as deemed necessary, before making an approval. 

2. 	
Within 30 days of submitting a completed application, 


in writing, the city manager or designee shall administratively approve the plan, or shall inform the applicant in writing as to why the administrative approval has not been granted.

Permits for building or site development shall not be 
submitted or applied for until Administrative Approval 
has been granted. 


4. 	
Decisions by the city manager or designee may be 
appealed to the zoning board of appeals. 



5. 	
The city manager or designee can opt to submit a 
plan for a Site Plan review even if it is eligible for 
Administrative Approval when the scale or effect of the 



project is deemed significant enough to warrant such 
review. 

C. 	Variances. All variances listed in Table 10.7 shall be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals, in accordance with Article 18. 

D. 	Deviations from Form Based District Requirements. A development in a form Based District that does not qualify for Administrative Approval requires Site Plan Review. 
1. 	
Site Plan Review cannot permit a lesser building or site 
requirement than that contained in this ordinance. A 
request for a lesser requirement shall be considered 
a variance and may only be approved by the zoning 
board of appeals per Article 18. 



2. 	
A deviation from requirements not listed as variances 
shall be reviewed under the requirements of this 
subsection. 


3. 	
The planning commission does not have the 
authority to change part of a site plan that meets the 
Development Requirements of the District or one that 





has been approved as an Administrative Departure. A. CBD District: Any expansion of a nonconforming 
E.	 In determining if a deviation is warranted, the planning commission shall consider the following: 
1. 	Deviations shall be permitted when an applicant demonstrates that the resulting design is superior in terms of compatibility with surrounding structures 
and better fits the character of the area than when it 
conforms to form-based requirements. 


2. 	
The planning commission may also allow deviations when the applicant shows that conformance with the form-based requirements is impractical due to existing building or site layouts or on adjacent sites, where the deviation has no exterior effect, or where the deviation is necessary to meet other laws or regulations. 

3. 	The deviation shall be the least necessary to achieve the results in either subparagraphs 1 or 2, above. 


4. 	
Cost, convenience or franchise/corporate designs shall not, by themselves, be reasons for granting a deviation. 


5. 	
The planning commission may grant a lesser deviation than requested. 

6. 	
When approving a deviation, the planning commission may attach conditions necessary to meet the requirements of this section and to uphold the intent of this article. 





Section 10.9. Nonconformities in the form-based districts 
Existing uses, structures (other than signs) and lots that do 
not conform to the requirements of the form-based districts shall be subject to the regulations of Section 3.29, except that 


the following provisions shall apply: 
structure greater than 25 percent of the gross leasable area of the existing building or any expansion or renovation of such structure greater than 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the expansion shall require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the form-based district  For any expansion, the more restrictive of these two criteria shall 
be controlling. For the purposes of this subsection: 
1.	 Expansion of a nonconforming structure shall be 
undertaken only one time per structure without 
requiring compliance with the code. 
2. 	
The assessed value shall be determined at the time of the proposed expansion. 

3. 	
An expansion on the front of a nonconforming building does not increase the extent of nonconformity if the expansion is at the same or less distance to the required build-to line as is the existing structure. 


4. 	Façade alterations to existing buildings or expansions that comply with the required build-to line shall also comply with building elements specifications of this article. 
5. 	Repair and maintenance work shall be allowed without regard to subparagraph 1, above; such exempt activities include roof replacement, window replacement and maintenance, mechanical and electrical upgrades, interior fit out (tenant improvement work), parking resurfacing and other site work, such as stormwater improvements, landscaping, and site amenities.  Any such non-complying expansion or site improvements shall nevertheless not occur outside of the required build-to lines of the property.  
6. 	A structure destroyed by any means by more than 50 percent of its value prior to such destruction shall be replaced only by a structure that conforms to the requirements of the form-based district; however, this does not preclude the property owner from seeking variances or deviations as provided by this article. 


7. 	Parking lots, bicycle facilities, loading areas, landscaping, screening, and other site improvements shall be considered structures for the purposes of these provisions. 


B. 	PB District. 
1. 	
Non-residential uses and structures in the PB District shall be subject to the same requirements as for all nonconforming uses and structures in the CBD District. 

2.	 
Residential uses: Any expansion or renovation of a 


residential structure greater than 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the expansion shall require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the PB District. 
3. 	A structure destroyed by any means by more than 50 percent of its assessed value prior to such destruction shall be replaced only by a structure that conforms to the requirements of the PB District; however, this does not preclude the property owner from seeking variances or deviations as provided by this article. 

C. 	Nonconforming signs. Existing signs that do not conform to the requirements of the form-based districts shall be subject to the regulations of Section 17.13 Non-Conforming Signs, except that the permission granted by Section 17.13, allowing the restoration of destroyed or damaged signs under 50 percent of the value, shall be permitted only within 6 months of the damage.

City of Grandville Zoning Ordinance 

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 11.1. Intent and purpose. 
Metropolitan growth and rising costs have necessitated land 
development that is economical, has higher densities, provides urban conveniences and yet retains many of the attractive features of suburban living. PUDs are regulated so that carefully planned areas for imaginative land uses, variety in the physical makeup of the community and attractive open spaces can be achieved. PUDs also include preserved and/or enhanced natural features, such as brooks, ponds, woodlots, 


floodplains, and other elements with significant aesthetic or 
recreational value. 
The 
following 
PUD 
requirements 
fulfill 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 

Zoning Ordinance through a development review process that applies site planning criteria to guarantee that a project is integrated with the character of the site and the surrounding 
area. PUDs must achieve the following: 

A. 	Provide innovative land uses and variety in the design, layout and types of structures. 

B.	 Accommodate economies and efficiencies in the use of 
land, natural resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities. 
C. 	Assure that a combination of uses comply with sound site planning standards that may vary from zoning regulations such as those that address the placement of land uses, lot area, and building regulations. 


D. 	Include usable open spaces and extensive landscaping. 
E.	 Provide opportunities to improve public streets or facilities, 
pathways, and natural storm water systems. 
F. 	Accommodate a walkable, mixed-use development that results in more sustainable and healthy neighborhoods.  

G. Provide a consistently high quality and coordinated level of site and architectural design and materials. 

H.	 Encourage the reuse and improvement of existing sites. 
I.	 Encourage the use and improvement of land where site 
conditions make development under conventional zoning 
difficult and less desirable. 
J.	 Provide enhanced residential, employment and commercial opportunities that are particularly suited to Grandvilles needs. 
K.	 Accommodate varied densities and uses that are complementary to and help strengthen sustainable development practices. 
Section 11.2. Rezoning to PUD 
PUDs shall be reviewed according to the procedures and standards in this article. Upon approval, the property subject to the PUD shall be indicated as such on the City Zone District Map, including the PUD type as outlined in Section 11.4. 
Section 11.3. Existing PUDs 
PUDs in existence at the time this ordinance was adopted shall continue to be regulated based on the requirements in place when the PUD was originally approved. However, an amendment or an expansion of an existing PUD shall be considered based on the requirements of this article. 
Section 11.4. PUD types 
A. 	Residential PUD (RPUD). This type of PUD allows a mix of housing types, such as single family detached, single family attached, two family and/or multiple-family. It also permits cluster and zero lot line development. 
B. 	Mixed Use PUD (MPUD). This type of PUD allows a mix of residential and non-residential uses either within a project or within a building(s). The mix of uses is determined by the uses allowed in the underlying zoning district.

2. 	Regulatory Flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity the planning commission may recommend the city council grant departures, except as otherwise prohibited, from zoning requirements.  Requirements for lot area and width, setbacks, building heights, 

and parking may be modified provided the results 
accomplish any of the following: additional open space; 
enhanced buffers to adjacent land uses; views that are screened along major streets, preserved natural features, pedestrian-oriented development, more 
efficiently used land, and proposed land uses that are 
compatible with adjacent ones. 

3. 	Approval of Departures. In approving the PUD, the planning commission shall recommend approval of any departure from any development regulation(s) and state that the departure results in a higher quality of development than would be possible when the zoning requirements of the existing zone district are applied.  

B. 	Open Space. A PUD shall include common open space 
that preserves significant natural features, that is 

accessible to the residents of the development and that connects with other open spaces within and adjacent to the development.  For a non-residential PUD, open space 
shall preserve natural features to the extent practicable and shall be located to enhance the character of the 
property and to benefit the users and employees of the 
development. 
1. 	Table 11.1 indicates PUD open space requirements,

2. 	To avoid scattered, isolated or remnant open spaces and to ensure they are valued and usable, contiguous open space shall be at least twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area and have a maximum width to 
depth ratio of 3:1. This requirement may be waived for 
an open space corridor with a pathway that is located between a row of lots or buildings, that interconnects open spaces, and that is a desirable element of the project. 
3. 	
Ineligible open space areas. Stormwater detention or retention, land under water, street rights-of-way, parking lots, required setbacks or bufferyards are not considered open space. 

4. 	
Protection. Open space and common areas shall be protected in perpetuity and retained as open space, park land, recreation, conservation or other similar uses, by an irrevocable conservation easement or shall otherwise be dedicated to an association of residents or owners. Documents shall be approved by the city, recorded by and all costs paid by the applicant, before a building permit can be issued. 


C. 	Signs. Signs shall comply with the requirements of Article 17; however, the city may approve or require departures when necessary to ensure safe and efficient traffic circulation or to reduce the number of signs that would otherwise be allowed. A PUD application shall include a plan showing all signs by type, location and setbacks, and the height and area of each sign. 


Planned Unit Development Districts 

D. 	Plats and Condominiums. When a portion of a PUD is density bonus, as provided in this section, if 
developed as a subdivision plat or condominium, the preliminary plat or the preliminary condominium site plan shall be submitted and reviewed concurrently with the 
final PUD. In such a case, the planning commission shall 
make a recommendation to the city council in accordance with the city Subdivision Regulations or Condominium Regulations, as applicable.  The regular subdivision or condominium approval process shall be followed from that point forward.

2. 	Streets, service roads or driveways that provide vehicular ingress to and egress from each development site must be properly located and designed so that they appropriately and safely relate to the surrounding network of streets, paths, and sidewalks. 

3. 	Site circulation and parking areas must be designed to 
ensure: 
a. 	Safety and convenience for vehicular and 
pedestrian traffic, both within the site and on 
streets accessing the PUD. 

b. 	Harmonious relationships between the PUD and existing and prospective development on adjacent land, especially when the uses are dissimilar. 

c. 	Access for emergency vehicles. 
4.	 Land uses must be functionally, efficiently, and 
compatibly arranged on the site and relate well to 
adjacent uses. 


5.	 Public spaces must be of a size and configuration and 
located to maximize access and visibility. 
6. 	
There must be available capacity for sewer and water service and other utilities. 

7. 	
Potential impacts related to air quality must be 
addressed. 


8. 	
Potential noise impacts related to the PUD and its 


associated traffic must be addressed. 
9. 	
The PUD must relate to and be compatible with the character of surrounding properties and not substantially interfere with the safety, light, air and convenience of surrounding private and public property. 

10. 
Any other matters that are within the jurisdiction of the city or its departments must be considered. 

11. 
The design of a PUD shall be more urban in character and emphasize walkability and pedestrian access. Automobile related facilities, such as parking lots, shall be designed to mitigate their impacts. 


Section 11.15. Effect of approval. 
Approval of the final PUD site plan shall be effective for 
a period of eighteen (18) months. Failure to complete substantial construction in that period shall void the PUD approval; however, the planning commission may grant a one 
(1) year extension upon written request by the applicant. A PUD that becomes void may not be constructed, and any further development of the property shall require a new PUD 
application to be filed, according to the process outlined in 
this article, or the property shall be rezoned to an appropriate district. 
Section 11.16. Changes to an approved PUD. 
A. All conditions imposed and recorded in the PUD approval action shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the city council and the landowner. The city council shall maintain a record of any granted changes in the conditions. 


B. 	The planning commission shall determine if a change is major or minor and it may approve a minor change. As a guide, the standards for minor changes to site plans defined in Section 14.8 shall be used, but other changes not listed that would significantly impact the factors considered when the PUD plan was approved shall also be considered to be a major amendment. 
C. 	Amendments that are determined by the planning commission to be major shall require the applicant, or the applicants successors, to return to the planning commission and city council for approval of an amended plan. The procedure outlined for original approval shall be followed when submitting an amended plan. 
Section 11.17. Appeals of PUD decisions 
A decision by the city regarding a PUD or a request for a departure from any applicable standard may not be made to the zoning board of appeals; however, the owners of individual properties within a PUD, to the extent not affected by the requirements and conditions of a PUD, may apply for variances to the underlying zoning district standards as they apply to the PUD, in accordance with the requirements of Article 18.

Section 12.26. Two-family dwelling units (R1-A and R1-B districts). 
A. 	Intent. This subsection regulates and guides the 
conversion to or construction of two-family dwelling units in the R1-A and R1-B residential districts. Two-family dwellings fill a need in the community for sound, affordable housing for persons of varying age groups and requirements. Further, when confronted with current energy and maintenance costs, converting a one-family dwelling to a two-family may extend the effective life of 
a structure that may otherwise border on obsolescence. 
Duplexes may also serve as transitional uses in select 
situations; therefore, the design provisions of this section 
do not stifle architectural design or style, rather they 
provide the minimum design controls needed to achieve the objectives of this section. Under these circumstances, the application of design guidelines for two-family units is based on the architectural elements of the structure being harmonious and proportional and relating to surrounding uses and structures. 


B. 	Application. This section shall apply to the development of two family dwellings in the R1-A and R1-B districts only. 
C. 	Development standards. 
1. 	Two-family dwellings are considered transitional uses and shall be located at subdivision entrances, abutting principal or minor arterial streets (as designated by 
the Grandville master plan) or high-traffic areas, or 
adjacent to public, multi-family residential, office, or 


other nonresidential uses. 
2. 	
A two-family dwelling shall look much like a one-family dwelling, have a similar scale, proportion, design, and character, have not more than one entrance per front or side elevation and include a garage. An elevation drawing shall be submitted with a special land use application for new construction. 

3. 	
Required parking shall be provided off-street. 




4.	 The minimum floor area for a dwelling unit shall be 900 
square feet.

additional antennas for future users.  
i.	  Identification of the entities providing the backhaul network for the tower(s) described in the application and other cellular sites owned or operated by the applicant in the municipality.  
j.  A description of the suitability of the use of existing towers, other structures or alternative technology not requiring the use of towers or structures to provide the services to be provided through the use of the proposed  

k. 	A description of the feasible locations(s) of future towers or antennas within the city based upon existing physical, engineering, technological or geographical limitations in the event the proposed tower is erected. 
l. 	An inventory of the proposed users existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one mile of the border of the city, including specific information 
about the location, height, and design of each tower. The city manager or designee may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative or special land use approval under this section, or with other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the city manager or designee is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 

H. 	Administratively approved uses: 
1. 	General. The following provisions shall govern the 
issuance of administrative approvals by the city 
manager or designee for towers and antennas.

c. 	
The city manager or designee shall respond to 



each application within 60 days after receiving it 	of new towers, provided that the co-location is 
by either approving or denying the application. If the city manager or designee fails to respond to the applicant within that 60 day period, then the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
d. 	If an administrative approval is denied, the 
applicant shall file an application for special land 
use approval by the planning commission pursuant 
to subsection H prior to filing any appeal that may 


be available under the zoning ordinance. 
2. 	Requirements for certain administratively approved uses. 
a. 	Antennas on existing structures. An antenna that attached to an existing structure and is not attached to a tower may be approved as an 
accessory use to any commercial, industrial, office 

or institutional structure, or to any multifamily 
structure of eight or more dwelling units in a conventional zoning district, as allowed in Table 12.30.F, provided: 
(1) 
The antenna does not extend more than 20 feet above the highest point of the existing structure; 

(2) 
The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations; and 



(3) 
The antenna complies with all applicable building codes. 


b. 	
Antennas on existing towers. An antenna proposed to be attached to an existing tower may be approved by the city manager and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction 



accomplished in a manner consistent with the 
following: 
(1)	 A tower that is modified or reconstructed to 
accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the city manager or designee allows reconstruction as a monopole. 
(2) Height. 
(a)	 An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt 
to a taller height, not to exceed 20 feet over the towers existing height, to accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna. 
(b) 
This height change may only occur one time per the lifetime of the communication tower. 

(c) 
The allowed additional height shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in subsection I. The towers 


pre-modification height shall be used to 
calculate such distance separations. 
I. 	Special land use approvals. 
1. 	General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance by the planning commission of special land use approvals for towers or antennas, as allowed in Table 12.30.F: 
a. 	Applications for special land use approvals under this section shall be subject to the procedures, standards  and requirements of Article 13, except 
as modified in this section. 
b. 	In granting a special land use approval, the planning commission may impose conditions that are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 


Use Restrictions 

c.  Any information of an engineering nature that  of the citys boundaries; and  
the applicant submits whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer.  j.  Willingness of the applicant to allow co-location of antennas on the proposed tower at a reasonable charge.  
2.  Factors considered in granting special land use approvals for towers. In addition to any standards for considering special land use approval pursuant to Article 13, the planning commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special land use approval. The planning commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the planning commission concludes that the goals of this section are better served and public health, safety and welfare are still met:  3.  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. A new tower shall not be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning commission that an existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures cannot accommodate the applicants proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the planning commission related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to 
 
a.  Height of the proposed tower;  demonstrate that an existing tower, structure or  
b. c. d.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; Surrounding topography;  alternative technology cannot accommodate the applicants proposed antenna may consist of the following: a.

subsection I.3;  the existing towers or structures, or the antenna  
i.  Willingness of the applicant to allow co-location of antennas at a reasonable charge on the applicants  on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicants proposed antenna. 
 
existing towers within the city and within one mile  e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required  


Use Restrictions by the owner in order to share an existing tower or 
structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
f. 	The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 

g. 	The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 

4. 	Setbacks. The following setbacks shall apply to all towers for which special land use approval is required. However, the planning commission may reduce the setback requirements if the goals of this section would be better served and that public health, safety and

Special Land Uses 


City of Grandville Zoning Ordinance 

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 13.1. Intent and purpose. 
Special land uses are generally consistent with the purpose of the zoning district in which they are permitted but, due to unique operational characteristics, may not be desirable or 
compatible in all locations. Factors such as traffic, hours of 

operation, noise, odor or similar potential effects require that the special use be evaluated relative to its appropriateness on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, special land uses are permitted within a zoning district following a review of the use 
and its potential impact on its surroundings and city approval. This chapter establishes the review procedures for special land uses and the general standards that must be met. 
Some special land uses require specific standards and 
requirements to mitigate their potential negative impacts. These specific standards, where applicable, are listed in Article 
12. 


Section 13.2. Scope. 
A special land use shall be permitted only when the planning commission has reviewed and approved the proposed use and the associated site plan, as provided by this article and other 
applicable provisions of this ordinance. Except as otherwise 

expressly provided by this ordinance, the general procedures, standards, and requirements in this article shall apply to all special land uses and shall be in addition to any other procedures, standards, or requirements that apply to particular 
special land uses under Article 12 or under other provisions of this ordinance.

C. 	The establishment, maintenance, location, or operation of the use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in that zone district. 
D. 	The establishment, maintenance, location, or operation of the proposed use will not be detrimental to or endanger the health, safety, or general welfare of any persons; will not be injurious to or conflict with the use or enjoyment of neighboring property for the purposes permitted; and will not result in any significant adverse impact on the natural environment. 
E.	 The proposed use will not involve activities, processes, materials, and equipment or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors. 
F. 	Adequate utilities, highways, streets, access, drainage 
structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, 
schools, and other necessary services or facilities have been or will be provided to serve the proposed use; the proposed use will not place undue demands on public services or facilities that result in exceeding their capacity. 

G. The proposed use will, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the zone district in which it is located, conditions of approval, and all other applicable provisions of law, ordinance, or statute.

City of Grandville Zoning Ordinance 

The CiTy of 
Grandville 
Section 14.1. Purpose and scope. 
A. 	Purpose and intent. This article establishes standards and requirements for site plan review and approval by the planning commission. As used in this section, the term site plan includes the documents and drawings as 
specified by this article that are necessary as a part of land 

development review. That process ensures that a proposed land use or activity is in compliance with applicable local ordinances and state statutes, and is compatible with the 
character of the surrounding area, the adjacent uses of land, the natural environment, the capacities of public services and facilities, and the public health, safety, and welfare. The standards and requirements of this article are in addition to those required elsewhere in this ordinance, which are applicable to the use or activity under consideration. 
B. Scope. Site plan review and approval by the planning 


commission is required for the following: 
1.	 A change in use, whenever the change: 
a. 	
is from a residential use to a non-residential use; 

b. 	
is from a non-residential use to another non­residential use that results in increased intensity of use on the property, or requires an increase in the number of required parking spaces. 



2. 	
An increase in the number of units in a multiple family development 


3. 	The creation of a principal use or the erection of a structure other than single family detached or a two family dwelling;

6. 	
Single-family attached and detached site condominium projects. 

7. 	
The site plan for any use that does not meet one of the above conditions and does not have an effect on the exterior of the property may be reviewed and approved by the city manager or designee. 

8.	 
Notwithstanding the above, a project that qualifies for 


administrative approval within a form-based district, per Section 10.7, is exempt from the requirements of this article. 
Section 14.2. Application procedures. 
A. 	An application, on a form supplied by the city, all required fees and all other required submittals for site plan review shall be submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the planning commission meeting at which the project will first be considered. The city manager or designee shall determine the required number of copies of the site plan, which shall be submitted along with the application. 
B. 	Fees established by resolution of the city council shall be 
paid to the city treasurer at the time the site plan is filed 
with the city manager or designee. Transmittals shall not be made until required fees have been paid in full and fees are not refundable.

Section 14.4. Site plan review process. 
The planning commission shall review site plans based on the purposes, objectives, and requirements of the zoning ordinance and the standards of this article. The planning commission may choose to preliminarily and informally review a proposed site plan with an applicant; however, such a review does not obviate the review procedures, standards and requirements of this article. The planning commission may also distribute site plans to governmental departments or 
officials allowing review and comment on matters that may fall 
under their jurisdiction. 
Section 14.5. Standards of review 
When reviewing a site plan the planning commission shall 
consider the following standards, as they may apply: 
A. 	Dimensional requirements. The arrangement of buildings and structures shall conform to the required yards, setback, and height restrictions of this ordinance. 
B. 	Building arrangement. Proposed buildings and structures shall have a harmonious relationship to the site, terrain, vegetation, open space, and other buildings, structures and improvements, existing and proposed. The bulk, location, and height of proposed buildings and structures, as well as the general character of the development, shall minimize any adverse impacts on other development in the surrounding area and shall not place excessive demands on public services or facilities. 
impacts shall be addressed in an appropriate manner 
that is environmentally sound, yet does not adversely 
affect neighboring properties or the public storm water 
system. If practical, water shall be returned on-site to the 
groundwater table from roofs, canopies, and paved areas 
utilizing best management practices, or shall be directed 
to an underground drainage system. Temporary on-site 
storage to reduce peak runoff may also be used. Rainwater 
from impervious areas shall not result in ponding that 


obstructs the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The 
use of rain gardens, sunken parking lot islands, pervious 
pavements, vegetated swales, and other low impact 
development techniques is encouraged. 


D. 	Public services and utilities. The location, availability, and compatibility of sewer, water, and storm drainage systems shall be considered. The location of utility distribution lines or associated utility installations shall result in a harmonious relationship between neighboring properties and the site. Utility lines (electric, phone, cable, etc.) shall be located underground unless the site has existing overhead service. 

E.	 Vehicular access and parking. Loading, unloading, parking, and on and off-site vehicular and pedestrian circulation shall be done safely and in a way that does not place demands on public services or facilities in excess of their capacities. All buildings and structures shall be accessible to emergency vehicles. 

F. 	Pedestrian access. Pedestrians must be able to safely and conveniently access major activity areas, and employment and service centers, and residential neighborhoods through interconnected walkways. Sidewalks shall be provided along streets unless the planning commission determines another way better serves these objectives. 

G. Exterior lighting. All lights shall be installed and 
maintained to confine illumination, as much as practicable, 
or divert glare to the property upon which the use is located. Light levels shall be adequate for the safety of occupants or users of the site and glare shall not adversely affect the safety or welfare of an adjacent property or street. 
H. 	Signs. The size, location, design, and lighting of signs shall be considered in relation to signs on adjacent sites, 


glare, traffic safety, and compatibility with adjoining 
properties. Signs shall be located and designed to avoid creating distraction or clutter. 
I. 	Special features: 

1. 	Storage areas, mechanical areas, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar features shall be located, buffered, and/or screened so as to be unobtrusive and not interfere with access to, or circulation within, the site. Such areas, buildings, structures, and features shall not detract from the visual impression of the site. 

2. 	Trash containers shall be enclosed on all sides by a structure aesthetically compatible with the development and surrounding property. The waste storage area shall be maintained free from litter and in a sanitary condition. 
J.	 Landscaping. Existing vegetation shall be preserved in 


its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal. Grade changes made shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas. Plants shall be used to enhance the appearance of the site, to screen unsightly or harsh elements, and to provide visual relief from large monotonous features, such as parking lots. Plants shall conform to the minimum 
requirements of the landscape regulations in Article 16. 
K.	 External effects. Noise, odor, light, dust, dirt, smoke, or other external effects from any aspect of the proposed use shall not adversely affect adjacent and neighboring properties or uses. 
L. 	Compliance with all applicable laws. The planning commission shall not approve a site plan that violates or that is inconsistent with local, state, or federal laws or regulations. 
Section 14.6. Site plan approvals. 
A. 	The planning commission shall review the site plan and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the site plan in accordance with this article and any of its applicable provisions. The basis for the decision, and any conditions imposed relating to approval, shall be specified in the record of the planning commission approving or denying the site plan. If approved, or approved with conditions, the site plan as approved shall become a part of the record. 
B. 	The chair of the planning commission and the applicant shall sign and date three copies of the site plan as approved. One signed copy shall be kept on file by the planning commission, one copy shall be forwarded to the city manager or designee, and one copy shall be returned to the applicant. 
C. 	A site plan shall expire one year from the approval date and the site plan shall be void unless the authorized use or activity has commenced prior to that time or an extension has been granted. 
1. The planning commission may approve an extension 
for an additional period of up to one year if: 
a. 	The extension is requested prior to the expiration of the initial one-year period; and 


Site Plan Review 

b. 	The applicant presents reasonable evidence that Section 14.8. Site plan modifications. 

the delay was due to unforeseen difficulties and 
that the use or activity will commence within the approved extension period. 
2. 	If the use or activity has not commenced within the approved extension period, or if an extension is denied, the site plan shall be void. 

Section 14.7. Conditions of approval. 
A. 	The planning commission may impose reasonable conditions in conjunction with site plan approval to ensure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased services and facility demands that may result, to protect natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. 
B.	 Conditions shall: 
1. 	
Be designed to protect natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of those who will use the proposed use, residents, and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed use, and the community as a whole;

2. 	
Storage areas can only be located within a side or rear yard, and shall not hinder driver or pedestrian site lines within the parking lot. 

3. 	
A snow storage area shall be at least equal to 10 percent of the area of the planned parking lot. The calculation for snow storage shall not include deferred parking areas, until such time the deferred parking area has been converted to parking. 

4. 	
Snow shall be removed as needed to maintain the number of required parking spaces. 


G. 	Construction and Maintenance. Parking lot construction shall require site plan approval in accordance with Article 14, Site Plan Review. Before a certificate of occupancy can be issued construction shall be completed and approved by the city manager or designee and the city engineer. 
1. 	
Parking lots and vehicle and equipment storage areas shall be paved with asphalt or concrete. The city engineer may also be approve alternate paving materials such as permeable/grass pavers. The planning commission may approve a substitute for hard-surfaced pavement in storage areas if they determine that it will not adversely impact an adjoining property. 

2. 	
Surfacing of a parking lot shall be completed prior to occupancy unless seasonal restrictions apply. In such cases the applicant shall provide a performance 


guarantee that ensures completion by a specified date 
the following season. 
3. 	Parking spaces shall be striped with paint or other approved material, at least four inches wide, well maintained and clearly visible. 


Parking 

4. 
Bumper blocks shall not be used in parking lots except Section 15.5. General off-street parking require­

where the planning commission determines they are necessary, or in the case of administrative approvals, the city manager or designee. 


5. 	
Rainwater from parking areas shall be detained on site in accordance with city engineering standards. Depressed landscape islands, rain gardens, permeable pavement, vegetative swales and other low-impact designs are preferred as a way to avoid large detention basins. 

6. 	
To protect landscaped areas, sidewalks, buildings, or adjacent property from vehicles that might otherwise extend beyond the edge of the parking lot, a six inch concrete curb, or alternative as determined by 




the planning commission, shall define all sides of a 
parking lot and landscaped islands. Curb openings to accommodate drives, sidewalks and storm water drainage, as recommended by the city engineer are allowed. Plants shall be located two feet from curbs to accommodate a bumper overhang. 
7. 	
Off-street parking areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the requirements of Article 15.

requirements established by the fire department. 
10. Parking lots shall be free of trash and debris and 
surfaces, curbs, light fixtures and signs shall be 
maintained in good condition. 

ments. 
A. 	Collective or Shared Parking. Two or more buildings or uses may use a common parking lot provided the total parking spaces are equal to the required number when all uses computed separately.  Cumulative parking requirements for mixed-use developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the planning commission when determined that one or more of the factors listed in 
subsection (d) below apply.  When uses are on separately-owned lots, a legal agreement for shared parking shall be recorded and a copy provided to the city before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
B. 	Reduction of Parking Requirements. The planning commission may reduce the parking requirements based on finding that there will be a lower demand for parking due to one or more of the following: 

1. 	Parking is shared by multiple uses and a high 
proportion of multi-purpose visits or uses will have 
peak parking demands during different times of 
the day or days of the week. However, pedestrian 
connections shall be maintained between all uses, 
separate parking lots shall be adjacent to each 
other and both pedestrian and vehicular access 
shall interconnect. After approval by the planning 

commission and before a certificate of occupancy can 
be issued a shared parking agreement shall be filed with the Kent County Register of Deeds and the city 
clerk. 
2. 	
Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street 
spaces are located along the frontage of the site. 


3. 	
Walk-in business is expected due to the density and 
intensity of adjacent residential neighborhoods or 





employment centers.  When a reduction in parking 
spaces is allowed off-site pedestrian connections and on-site pedestrian circulation must offer safe and convenient access to building entrances. 
4. 	Other forms of travel such as transit are available. When a reduction in parking spaces is allowed site design that incorporates transit stops, pedestrian connections to nearby transit stops or bicycle parking facilities may be required. 


5. 	The applicant provides a parking study, conducted 
by a qualified traffic engineer, that demonstrates a 
different standard would be more appropriate based on the actual number of employees, expected level 
of customer traffic or actual counts at a similar 
establishment.  The planning commission may require a parking study to document that any one of the criteria (1) through (4) above would be met. 


C. 	Maximum Allowed Parking. To minimize excessive pavement that can negatively affect site aesthetics and contribute to high rates of storm water runoff, the planning commission may allow the minimum parking space requirement to be exceeded by not more than 10 percent. In granting additional parking spaces the planning commission shall determine that based on documented evidence more parking will be required to accommodate a use on a typical day.  The planning commission may require the additional parking spaces to be constructed using alternative paving materials, such as permeable/ grass pavers or pervious concrete. 

D. 	Banked Parking. 

1. 	Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the planning commission may defer some 
of the parking. The city may request a performance guarantee to cover the cost of developing the deferred parking lot. 
2. 	
The site plan shall identify portions of the site where future parking spaces may be located. Such areas must be maintained in a landscaped appearance and not occupy required greenbelts, or parking lot setbacks or be used for any other purpose.  Landscaping, such as parking lot trees that would otherwise be required shall be installed in the banked parking area. 

3. 	
The banked parking shall meet all ordinance requirements if constructed; based on parking needs or observation, construction of the deferred parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the city manager or designee. Such an action shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan. 


E.	 Prohibited uses. Except as may be approved as a special 
land use, the following are prohibited for areas designated 
for parking, access and maneuvering: 
1. 	
outdoor storage or display of merchandise; 

2. 	
motor vehicle sales, except on properties where vehicle sales are allowed as the principal use; 

3. 	
trucks or equipment, unless being used for a permitted construction project on the same site; 

4. 	
wrecked, junked or unlicensed vehicles; 

5. 	
vehicle repair.

2. 	Using landscaping to address alternative stormwater management techniques, such as green roofs, rain gardens and vegetative swales, is encouraged. Where such measures are incorporated into a site plan and 

the planning commission finds that the proposed 

techniques meet the intent of this section and that the low-impact stormwater management improves drainage or protects sensitive natural features (such as streams, lakes or wetlands) on the site and/or within 
the surrounding area some of the requirements of this section may waived. 
3. 	Existing Landscaping: 
a.	 Existing trees shall be labeled To Be Removed or 

To Be Saved on the site plan. If labeled To Be Saved, protective measures shall be implemented, such as installing a construction fence around a tree(s) and vegetation at the critical root zone. Vehicles or other construction equipment shall not 
be parked or stored within such a protected area. 
b.	 Efforts will be made to preserve existing healthy 

trees on a property outside the immediate building area that are greater than 12 inches in diameter, measured four and one half feet above the ground.  In order to preserve landmark trees the planning commission shall review and approve tree 
protection measures and may also require changes to a site plan. 
c. 	Should trees and plants, intended to meet the requirements of this section, be cut down, damaged or destroyed, they shall be replaced with the same species or an approved substitute.

Section 16.6. Bufferyards. 
A bufferyard is a designated open area that includes required plants, barriers, or fences. The required land area and the 
type and amount of landscaping specified by these provisions 
lessen impacts between adjoining land uses and minimize potential nuisances such as noise, glare, activity, dirt, or 
unsightly parking lots. Bufferyard standards must be flexible 
and respond to the particular circumstances associated with different land uses and activities. A single standard applied to unnecessary hardships. Accordingly, the following provisions 
provide flexibility by allowing four basic elements to be manipulated: distance, type of plant, density, and land forms. 
A. 	Bufferyards required. When required, bufferyards shall be located along exterior lot lines and extend to the boundary of a lot or parcel. Bufferyards shall not extend into or be located within an existing street right-of-way. 

B. 	General bufferyard requirements: 
1. 	When Required. 
a. 	
A bufferyard is required whenever a property in a conventional Commercial or Industrial zoning district abuts property in an R1, R-2 or R3 residential district or the PB Prairie/Barrett Form-based District, or when a property in an R-3 District abuts any property in the R1 districts, R2 districts or the PB District. 


b. 	
The planning commission may also require a landscaped bufferyard in conjunction with site plan review, Planned Unit Development or Special Land Use. When a bufferyard is required, it shall be located on the multi-family or nonresidential district property. The planning commission shall approve the location, size, shape, landscape design, 


materials and other bufferyard specifications 

subject to the general requirements of this section. 
2. 	A bufferyard may contain berms, landscaping as 
required by this section, additional plants where the 

required landscaping is insufficient, walls, fences, or 
any combination of these elements. 
3. 	Front yards. Except as otherwise required by this 
section, when a property in a different zoning district, 


as defined in subparagraph 1.a, above, is located 

across a street right-of-way, a bufferyard shall be 
located within the required front yard setback. In addition to the setback landscaping requirements in section 16.4, the bufferyard shall be landscaped with at least one evergreen tree for every 20 lineal feet, or fraction thereof, of frontage abutting a public road 
right-of-way. Evergreen trees within a bufferyard shall 
be at least six feet tall at the time of planting. 

4. 	
Bufferyards along all other property lines. Bufferyard(s) shall be located within the required side or rear setback. In addition to the setback landscaping requirements listed in Section 16.4, the bufferyard shall contain four shrubs for every 20 lineal feet of property line and grass, ground cover, or other natural landscape materials. 


5. 	Areas that do not contain trees or planting beds shall be planted with grass or other living ground cover. 



6. 	
Detention/retention areas shall be permitted within the required bufferyard, except as may be prohibited elsewhere in this section. However, they must not hamper screening or jeopardize plant survival. 

7. 	
The planning commission may reduce the landscaping requirements when berms, fences or walls are used as buffers; however, there shall be no gaps between trees or shrubs greater than 50 feet along a property line. Trees located behind a fence or wall shall count toward this requirement. 



8. 	District Specific Bufferyard Requirements: 
a.	 OS-2 District: 
(1) A bufferyard adjacent to 44th Street shall be 
landscaped as follows: 

(a) At least six canopy or coniferous trees for every 100 lineal feet of bufferyard; and

Table 17.5 Prohibited Signs  
Unsafe Signs. A sign or sign structure that: a. is structurally unsafe; b. constitutes a hazard to safety or health because of poor maintenance, dilapidation, or abandonment; c. is capable of causing an electric shock; or d. it has broken parts, missing letters, or lights that do not work.  

A. 	Permit required. Unless specifically exempted from permit requirements in this article, no sign shall not be erected unless a sign permit, in accordance with section 17.11, has been issued by the city manager or designee. 
B. 	Design, construction, and maintenance. All signs shall be designed, constructed, altered, and maintained in 
accordance with the following: 

1. 	
Signs shall comply with the provisions of this article and applicable building and electrical codes, and shall be maintained in good structural condition. 

2.	 
Except as otherwise allowed by this article, signs 


and supporting structures shall be constructed of lasting and quality materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or a structure directly attached to a rigid wall, 
frame, or other structure. Sign support systems and 
related attachments shall be designed by a qualified 
professional. 
3.	 Except as otherwise allowed by this article, a sign shall 
not be placed on or attached to a pole supporting utilities or street signs. 
4. 
Signs using glass shall not create a hazard if broken. 


5. 
Illuminated signs shall be constructed and maintained 



in full compliance with applicable electrical codes. 
a.	 Except for electronic message signs allowed by this 
article, lights shall not be intermittent, oscillate, or 
flash. 
b. 	Glare and direct light from a sign shall not trespass onto an adjacent residentially zoned lot, and except as otherwise allowed, lights shall be shielded from neighboring uses. 
c.	 Exposed neon lights are permitted only in the C-1, 


C-3, C-4 and C-5 districts. 
C. 	Sign area and sign height. The following shall control sign area (individual sign area and maximum allowed sign area per lot) and sign height calculations. 
1.	 Computing the area of an individual single-faced sign: 
The area of a sign is determined by measuring the smallest right-angled polygon that can completely cover all sign text, logo, emblem, image or other 


figure, and the color, frame or other background 
material that differentiates the sign from its backdrop or the structure against which it is placed. Supporting structures (such as a brace, pole, fence or wall) are not included in calculations if they otherwise meet the applicable requirements of this zoning ordinance, they are clearly incidental to the sign, and do not contain advertising copy. 


2. 	Computing the area of a multi-faced sign. The area of a sign is determined by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from a single location on the ground. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both cannot be simultaneously viewed from a single location and when the sign faces are contained by the same structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, sign area is determined by measuring one of the faces. If back-to-back sign faces are of unequal area, 

the larger of the two shall be used for the calculation. 
3. 	Computing sign height. Sign height is determined by measuring the distance from the base of the sign or supporting structure at normal grade to the top of the highest sign component. Normal grade is the lower of either the existing grade before the sign was constructed or the new grade after construction of the 
sign, exclusive of any filling, berming or excavating 
associated with locating the sign. 

D. 	Clear vision requirements for intersections and entrance ways. In addition to the setback requirements of this article signs must also meet the clear vision requirements of section 3.18. 
E.	 Signs that project over a public right-of-way. An awning sign, marquee sign, projecting sign, or suspended sign may project over a right-of-way; complying with the requirements of Table 17.9.B. The owner of the sign must 


Signs 

maintain liability insurance in an amount of $500,000.00 property on which they are located. 

per occurrence per sign. The city must be named as an additional insured party and insurance must be in a form and in an amount deemed necessary by the city manager or designee. 

F. 	Responsibility for signs. All signs shall be erected, altered, and maintained at the risk of the sign owner who shall assume full responsibility for consequences of any damage caused by the sign. 
G. 	Removal of signs notice. A sign that is deemed unsafe, improperly maintained, or otherwise does not comply with the requirements of this article shall be removed by the owner within 24 hours of receiving a notice from the city manager or designee. The notice shall state that the sign will be removed unless the owner corrects the problem within 24 hours of receiving the notice. If not corrected the city manager or designee shall take whatever action is necessary to have the sign removed or abate the unsafe or improper condition. In addition, the city manager or designee shall take whatever action is necessary to recover from the sign owner all costs to remove and dispose the sign or abate the unsafe or improper condition. 
H. 	Abandoned signs. A sign that the city manager or designee determines to be abandoned shall be removed by the owner. If the owner does not remove the sign, or if an owner cannot be found, the city may remove the sign. If the owner is known, the city shall have the right to recover all costs to remove and dispose the sign.

be reclassified to a type of sign subject to different or 
more restrictive regulations (e.g., a change from an on-premise to an off-premise sign). Further, routine repair to maintain a nonconforming sign in a safe and aesthetic condition exactly as it existed at the time of the enactment

C. Damage or destruction. If a nonconforming sign is 
damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, wind, or 
other calamity, the sign may be restored to the condition 
exactly as it existed immediately prior to the damage 
or destruction, unless the estimated cost of restoration 
or replacement exceeds 50 percent of the appraised 
replacement cost of the entire sign prior to the loss, as 

determined by the building official. If the estimated cost 

of restoration or replacement exceeds 50 percent of that 
appraised replacement cost, the right to continue using 

the nonconforming sign shall immediately terminate and 
the sign shall be brought into full compliance with all 
applicable provisions and requirements of this article prior 
to further use.

the applicant that there are practical difficulties in the 
way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance relating to the construction, equipment, or alteration of buildings or structures, or of storm water management requirements so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured and substantial justice done. 


Zoning Board of Appeals 

2. 	A dimensional variance may be allowed by the ZBA to allow the preservation of these substantial 

only in cases where the applicant has shown a practical 
difficulty in the official record of the hearing. The 
applicant must prove that all of the following conditions 
have been met: 
a.	 Extraordinary Circumstances. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions may include: 
(1)	 Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the effective date of 
this ordinance. 
(2) 
By reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on the land, building or structure. 

(3) 
By reason of the use or development of the property immediately adjoining the property in question; whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of this ordinance would 


involve practical difficulties. 
b.	 Substantial Justice. Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density, or other dimensional provisions would unreasonably prevent the use of the property.  Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district and such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity.  Any variance granted shall be the minimum necessary property rights.  The possibility of increased 
financial return shall not of itself be deemed 
sufficient to warrant a variance. 
c. 	
Impact on Surrounding Neighborhood.  The variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood or interfere with or discourage the appropriate development, continued use, or value of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood as compared to other uses in the neighborhood. 


d. 	
Public Safety and Welfare.  The granting of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or 


increase the danger of fire or endanger the public 
safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city. 

e.	 Not Self Created. The immediate practical difficulty 
causing the need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant. 

G. 	Use Variances 
1. 	Application Requirements. In addition to the 
information required for other variance requests, 
an application for a use variance shall include a 

plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and 

improvements proposed by the applicant, and a 
summary of the facts which support each of the 

following conclusions: 
a. 	
Applicants property cannot be used for the 
purposes permitted in the zoning district; 


b. 	
Applicants plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to his property and not to general 




neighborhood conditions; 

c.  Applicants suggested use would not alter the essential character of the area;  
d.  Applicants problem has not been self-created;  
e. 
 Unavailability of administrative relief which may afford reasonable use of applicants property.  
f. 
 At the end of each statement (a) through (e) above, identify all persons who will testify at the hearing with respect to each of the facts and, separately, identify all persons who will testify at the hearing relative to the respective conclusion (and if any person is to be offered as an expert witness, include with the application a resume which shows the education and experience of such person within the particular area of expertise).  

2. 	Use Variance -- Pre-Hearing Conference. 
a. 	
Prior to the scheduling of a hearing, the applicant shall contact the city manager or designee for the purpose of scheduling a pre-hearing conference. 

b. 	
The purposes of the pre-hearing conference shall 


be to: 
(1) Review the procedure for the hearing and identify all persons who will testify (directly 
or through affidavit) and the evidence to be 
offered on behalf of the applicant; 


(2) Attempt to secure a statement of agreed-upon facts to be used to narrow the matters of dispute and shorten the hearing; 
(3)	 Explore a means of providing relief to the 

applicant by way of non-use variance from the ZBA, or other relief which may require action by 
persons or bodies other than the ZBA which will afford an adequate remedy for the applicant; 
(4) Discuss the need, desirability, and the terms of providing a verbatim record of the hearing. 
c. 	
The city manager or designee shall determine who should be present at the pre-hearing conference based upon the application submitted, and taking into consideration the discussion with the applicant or the applicants representative. 

d. 	
The pre-hearing conference shall be scheduled and conducted on an expeditious basis so as to avoid 


unreasonable delay to the applicant. Sufficient time 
shall be taken, however, to achieve the purposes of the pre-hearing conference stated above. 
3. 	Use Variance -- Hearing Procedure. 
a. 	The applicant will have the burden of proof. In order to be entitled to relief, the applicant must demonstrate each of the five factors in subsection 5 of this section. 
b.	 Manner of Presentation 
(1) Community representatives shall present an overview of the zoning regulations involved. This may include an indication of the objectives sought to be achieved in the zoning district, 
and any planning, engineering, financial, 
environmental or other considerations which are generally relevant within the zoning district and/or in the general area of the property at issue. 
(2) The applicant may present witnesses, including 
the applicant, or may submit affidavits, for 
the purpose of attempting to prove facts or conclusions. The applicant shall be provided 
with the opportunity to present all testimony 

Zoning Board of Appeals and evidence proposed to be presented points raised by interested persons and community 

at the pre-hearing conference, either 
through witnesses or affidavits; however, 
the chairperson of the ZBA may restrict testimony and evidence which would result in unreasonable duplication. In addition, by motion made on its own or at the request of a person at the hearing, the ZBA may require the presence of any witness who has offered either 
testimony by affidavit on a material question of 
fact or testimony of an expert nature, with the view of permitting members of the ZBA to ask questions of such witnesses. 
(3) At the conclusion of the applicants presentation, interested persons attending the hearing shall be provided with the opportunity to present testimony and evidence in the same manner and subject to requiring the presence and questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the applicant. 
c. 	When interested persons have completed their presentations, at the same meeting and/or at an adjourned meeting date, testimony and evidence may be presented on behalf of the community in the same manner, and subject to requiring the presence and questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the applicant. The purpose of such presentation shall be to ensure that a full picture, including all relevant information, is before the ZBA for consideration as it relates to the specific application presented. 
d. 	If testimony or evidence has been offered by or on behalf of interested persons and/or the community, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make a responsive presentation, restricted to answering the representatives. The manner of presenting witnesses, and requirement of their presence and questioning, shall be the same as provided above for the applicants principal case. 
e. 	
At the hearing, the ZBA may establish other rules 
of procedure, such as meeting hours on any given 
day, procedure for presentations by interested 
persons and/or on behalf of the community, or 
other rules found to be necessary or appropriate 
by the board. When questions of procedure arise 
during the hearing, the chairperson of the ZBA may 
solicit the recommendation of the representatives 
of both the applicant and the community. 



f. 	
If a hearing is not completed at a given meeting 
within the time period allowed by the ZBA, the 
board shall adjourn the hearing to a date certain 
for continuation. 




4. 	Use Variance -- Decision of the zoning board of appeals 
a. 	The ZBA may deem it appropriate in any given case 
to provide an opportunity for anyone presenting 

testimony or evidence to submit proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions. 
b. 	At the conclusion of the hearing, the ZBA may 
make its decision at that meeting, or it may 
adjourn the hearing to a new date for the purpose 
of reviewing the testimony and evidence, and 


reviewing proposed findings and conclusions 
submitted by hearing participants, in preparation for making its decision. 
c. 	If the ZBA determines to grant variance relief, 
it shall be the minimum relief required to allow 
reasonable use of the property, while maintaining 
the essential character of the area. Such relief may 



be in the form of one or more non-use variances 
and/or in the form of a use variance. The motion 
may include conditions that are authorized by law. 
d. 	If the ZBA adopts a motion to grant variance relief, such a motion may be made as a tentative grant of relief, subject to review by the planning commission, planning director/consultant, engineer 
or other person or official with expertise, with 

a view of obtaining recommendations on any 
conditions that may be relevant and authorized by law, and for the further purpose of ensuring that the grant of relief would not violate applicable law. If such a tentative grant of relief is approved, the ZBA shall request the completion of all reviews by 
other boards or persons by a specific date, so that 
relief may be expeditiously finalized. 

5. 	Use Variance Standards for Review. A use variance may be allowed by the ZBA only in cases where the applicant has shown an unnecessary hardship in the 

official record of the hearing. The applicant must prove that all of the following conditions have been met: 
a. 	Hardship.  The applicant has demonstrated that the site cannot reasonably be used for any of the uses allowed within the current zoning district designation. The ZBA may require professionals 
or certified experts to submit documents to 


substantiate this finding. 
b. 	Unique Circumstances.  That the condition or 
situation of the specific parcel of property or 

the intended use of such property for which the variance is sought is unique to that property and not commonly present in the general vicinity or in the zone district. The applicant must prove that 
there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment. 
Such unique conditions or situations include: 
(1)	 Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the effective date 
of the ordinance from which this chapter is 
derived. 
(2)	 Exceptional topographic conditions or other 
extraordinary situation on the land, building or 
structure. 
(3) 
The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the property in question. 

(4) 
Any other physical situation on the land, building or structure deemed by the ZBA to be extraordinary. 


c. 	
Character of Neighborhood.  The use variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or the intent of the comprehensive development plan, or be a detriment to adjacent properties. 

d. 	
Capacity of Roads, Infrastructure and Public Services.  The capacity and operations of public roads, utilities, other facilities and services will not 


be significantly compromised. 
e.	 Not Self Created. The immediate practical difficulty 
causing the need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant. 
Section 18.5. Procedure. 
The following procedures shall be followed: 
A. 	An application for decision by the board for all matters 


Zoning Board of Appeals delegated to the board by this ordinance, or for shown, be granted by the board or by the Circuit Court, on

Within 30 days after a final hearing the ZBA shall make a 
decision on an application and appeal. A copy of the boards decision shall be transmitted to the applicant or appellant, and to the city manager or designee.

criteria in making their findings, recommendations, and 
decisions: 

1. 	
Consistency with the goals, policies and future land 
use map of the Grandville master plan, including all 
applicable subarea and corridor studies. If conditions 
have changed since the master plan was adopted, then 
consistency with recent development trends in the area 
shall be evaluated. 



2. 	
Whether development under current zoning is 
impractical or less reasonable than the requested or 
other zoning district given factors such as development 
trends and other factors. 





3. 
Capability of the sites physical, geological, 

hydrological, and other environmental features to accommodate the potential uses allowed in the proposed zoning district. 

4. 	
Compatibility of all the potential uses allowed in the proposed zoning district with surrounding uses and zoning in terms of land suitability, impacts on the 


environment, noise, density, nature of use, traffic 

impacts, aesthetics, infrastructure, impact on the ability 
to develop adjacent properties under existing zoning, 
and potential influence on property values. 
5.	 Capacity of city infrastructure and services sufficient 
to accommodate the uses permitted in the requested district without compromising the health, safety, and welfare of the city. 

6. 	The apparent need for the types of uses permitted in the requested zoning district in the city in relation to the amount of land in the city currently zoned to accommodate that need. 

7. 	Other factors as determined by the planning commission and the city council. 
B. 	Where a rezoning is reasonable given the above criteria, a determination shall be made that the requested zoning district is more appropriate than another district or amending the list of permitted or special land uses within a district. 


Section 19.5. Amendments required to conform to court decree. 
An amendment for the purpose of conforming to a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be adopted by the city council and published, without necessity of a public hearing or 
a referral to any other commission or agency. 
Section 19.6. Conditional zoning agreement. 
A. 	Conditional Zoning Agreement.

A decision to submit a conditional zoning agreement shall be pursuant to the Zoning Act and this article. 
B. 	The conditional zoning agreement shall be in writing, executed by the applicant and the city and recorded with the Kent County Register of Deeds. 
C. 	The conditional zoning agreement may include limitations on the uses permitted on the property in question, specification of lower density or less intensity of development and use; may impose greater restrictions on the location, size, height, or other measure for buildings, structures, improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design, architecture and other features; or may provide for financing and installation of public works necessary to serve the proposed project. 
D. 	Compliance with ordinance requirements. 
1. 	
The conditional zoning agreement shall not authorize uses or developments of greater intensity or density, or which are not permitted in the proposed zoning district; 

2. 	
The conditional zoning agreement may not permit variations from height, area, setback or similar dimensional requirements that are less restrictive than the proposed zoning district; however, any variance approved by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with article 18 may be allowed as part of a conditional rezoning agreement. 

3. 	
If a special land use or site plan review is required by 




Amendments this ordinance for use proposed or subject to conditions assigns, receivers or transferees. Where the applicant 

within the rezoning agreement, the use(s) shall comply with the review and approval requirements as applicable prior to establishing or commencing the use(s). 

E.	 The conditional zoning agreement shall include conditions 
that bear a reasonable and rational relationship and/or 
benefit to the property in question. The conditional zoning 
agreement may include conditions related to the use and 
development of the property that are necessary to: 
1. 	
Serve the property with improvements, including but not limited to, the extension, widening, or realignment of streets; construction or extension of utilities, other infrastructure improvements serving the site; or the construction of recreational facilities serving the site or uses thereon; 

2.	 
Minimize the impact of the development on 


surrounding properties and the city overall; or, 
3. 	Preserve natural features and open space beyond what is normally required. 

F. 	Content of Agreement. In addition to any limitations on use or development of the site, preservation of site features or improvements described above, the conditional zoning agreement shall also include the following: 
1. 	
An acknowledgement that the conditional zoning agreement was proposed voluntarily by the applicant. 

2. 	
A statement that the property shall not be developed or used in any manner that is not consistent with the conditional zoning agreement. 

3. 	
A statement that the approval of the rezoning and the conditional zoning agreement shall be binding upon 


and inure to the benefit of the property owner and 
the city, and also their respective heirs, successors, 
for rezoning is acting on behalf of the landowner through some form of purchase agreement or other mechanism, then the landowner must also consent and sign the agreement. 
4. 	A statement that, if a rezoning with a conditional 
zoning agreement becomes void in accordance with 
this section, that no further development shall take 
place and no permits shall be issued unless and until 


a new zoning district classification for the property has 
been established. 
5. 	
A statement that no part of the conditional zoning 
agreement shall permit any activity, use, or condition 
that would otherwise violate any requirement or 
standard that is otherwise applicable in the new zoning 
district. 


6. 	
A legal description of the land to which the agreement 
pertains. 



7. 	
Any other provisions as are agreed upon by the parties. 



G. 	Process. The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed concurrently with the petition for rezoning following the process in Section 19.3 and the following: 
1. 	The conditional zoning agreement may be submitted 
prior to or following the planning commission public 
hearing. If the agreement is provided following the 
public hearing it must be reviewed by the planning 
commission prior to planning commission making its 
recommendation on the rezoning to the city council. 
The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed 
by the city attorney to determine that the conditional 
zoning agreement conforms to the requirements of this 


section and the Zoning Act and shall confirm that the 
conditional zoning agreement is in a form acceptable 

for recording with the Kent County Register of Deeds. 

2. Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning 
amendment, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council based upon the criteria listed in Section 19.4. In addition, the planning commission shall consider whether the proposed 


conditional zoning agreement: 

a.  Is consistent with the intent of this section;  
b.  Bears a reasonable and rational connection  
or benefit to the property being proposed for rezoning;  
c. 
 Is necessary to insure that the property develops in such a way that protects the surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any potential impacts to adjacent properties;  
d.  Is necessary to allow the rezoning to be approved, in that the property could not or would not be rezoned without the proposed conditional zoning agreement;  
e. 
 Leads to a development that is more compatible with abutting or surrounding uses than would have been likely if the property had been rezoned without a conditional zoning agreement, or if the property were left to develop under the existing zoning classification; and,  
f.  Is clearly in the public interest and not inconsistent with the recommendations of the Grandville master  
plan.  

3. 	If a conditional zoning agreement has been offered by the applicant and recommended for approval by the planning commission, the city council may approve the conditional zoning agreement as a condition to the rezoning if it meets all requirements of subsection 2, above. The conditional zoning agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by the city council to accomplish the requested rezoning. 
4. If the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement are 
approved, the zoning classification of the rezoned 
property shall consist of the district to which the property has been rezoned, and a reference to the 
conditional zoning agreement. The Official Zoning Map 
shall specify the new district, plus a parenthetical CZ to indicate that the property is subject to a conditional zoning agreement (i.e., R1-A (CZ)). The city clerk shall maintain a listing of all properties subject to conditional zoning agreements and shall provide copies of the agreements upon request. 
5. The approved conditional zoning agreement shall be 
recorded with the Kent County Register of Deeds. 
6. 	Any uses proposed as part of a conditional zoning agreement that would otherwise require approval of a special land use or site plan approval shall be subject to the applicable review and approval requirements of Articles 13 and 14. 
H. 	Expiration 
1. 	
The rezoning and conditional zoning agreement shall expire one year after adoption of the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement, unless substantial construction on the approved development of the property, pursuant to building and other required permits issued by the city commences within the one year period and proceeds diligently to completion, unless extended by the city council for good cause. 

2. 	
In the event that substantial construction on the approved development has not commenced within one year, the conditional zoning agreement shall be void. 




Amendments 

3. Should the conditional zoning agreement become void, same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning 

all development on the subject property shall cease, and no further development shall be permitted. Until action satisfactory to the city is taken to bring the property into compliance with the conditional zoning agreement, the city may withhold or, following notice to the applicant and being given an opportunity to be 
heard, revoke permits and certificates, in addition to or 
in lieu of any other lawful action to achieve compliance. 
4. 	Notwithstanding the above, if the property owner applies in writing for an extension of the conditional zoning agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration date, the city council may grant an extension of up to one year. Further extensions may be granted by the city council, although the number of previous extensions granted to a particular conditional zoning agreement shall be considered in relation to the diligent effort of the land owner to satisfy the conditions of the agreement. 

I. 	Reversion of zoning. If the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement becomes void as previously outlined, then the land shall revert back to its prior zoning classification as set forth in the Zoning Act. The city manager or designee shall initiate the rezoning to the prior zoning classification and advise the land owner and/or developer, by registered letter, of the reversion of zoning. 
J.	 Continuation. Provided that all development and/ or use of the property in question is in compliance with the conditional zoning agreement, an authorized use or development may continue indefinitely, provided that all terms of the conditional zoning agreement continue to be met. 
K.	 Amendment. The conditional zoning agreement may be amended by the city with the landowners consent in the 
and conditional zoning agreement. 

L. 	Violation of agreement. Failure to comply with the conditional zoning agreement at any time after approval will constitute a breach of the agreement and also a violation of this Ordinance and further use of the property may be subject to legal remedies available to the city. 
M.	 Subsequent rezoning of land. Nothing in the conditional zoning agreement, nor any statement or other provision, shall prohibit the city from later rezoning all or any portion of the property that is the subject of the conditional zoning agreement to another 

zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in 
compliance with this ordinance and the Zoning Act. 

N. 	Failure to offer conditions. The city shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect the owners rights under this ordinance. 

O. 	City not obligated. The city is not required or obligated to accept any or all conditions offered by a developer on a rezoning application. In no way is an offer of a conditional zoning agreement the basis for requiring the city to approve a rezoning application.
