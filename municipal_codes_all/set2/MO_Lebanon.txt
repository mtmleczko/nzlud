PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Lebanon of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Andrew D. Connally, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Kenneth Cowan, Mayor; Thomas J. O'Neil, City Counsellor; Robert Mayfield, Municipal Judge and Phyllis Richardson, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in those catchlines, headings and titles;

    Controllable asset means a controllable asset fails the cost test of being a capital item, but needs to be controlled. These assets are not capitalized on the general ledger nor are they depreciated, but they are inventoried on the fixed asset system and given a unique identifying number. 
    Curable condition means curable conditions can be corrected economically through major repairs or replacement. 
    Depreciation means in both the valuation and accounting senses implies a loss in the value of a given asset or property.

The cost of the betterment is added to the book value and the total remaining undepreciated cost is allocated over the estimated remaining life. 
(3)  If a component of an asset is replaced, the book value of the replaced component should be deleted from the books to prevent an overstatement of the asset's value.

( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.2. - General objectives. 
    The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be: 
(1)  Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The goal is to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. 
a.  Credit risk. The City of Lebanon will minimize credit risk, the loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by diversifying the portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized. 
b.  Interest rate risk. The city will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in the market interest rates. 
(2)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in bank deposits or repurchase agreements that offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds. 
(3)  Return. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions: 
a.  A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal; 
b.  A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio; and 
c.  Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.3. - Standards of care. 
(a)  Prudence. The standard of care to be used by investment officials shall be the Missouri Prudent Investor Act and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion to the governing body and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
    The "prudent person" standard states that: 
    "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived." 
(b)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. Disclosure shall be made to the governing body. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking any personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the city. 
(c)  Delegation of authority and responsibilities. 
(1)  Governing body. The governing body will retain ultimate fiduciary responsibility for the portfolios. The governing body will receive monthly reports, designate investment officers and review the investment policy making any changes necessary by adoption. 
(2)  Investment officers. Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the city administrator, hereinafter referred to as investment officer, as designated by the governing body. 
Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated to the finance director, who shall act in accordance with established written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Officers will prepare monthly investment reports and other special reports as may be deemed necessary. 
All participants in the investment process shall seek to act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. No officer or designee may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and supporting procedures. 
(3)  Investment committee. The city may seek to establish an investment committee to provide guidance to investment officers. The committee would be established by the governing body in a manner as other committees within the city. 
(4)  Investment adviser. The city may enter into agreements with one or more external investment managers to assist in the management of the entity's investment portfolio in a manner consistent with the entity's objectives. Such external managers may be granted discretion to purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this investment policy. Such managers must be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Approval of such agreements by the governing body is required. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.4 - Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. 
(a)  Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. A list will be maintained of financial institutions and depositories authorized to provide investment services. In addition, a list will be maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by conducting a process of due diligence. These may include 'primary" dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) and are deemed adequately financed to conduct public business. The city shall not conduct public business with any securities dealer through which public entities have paid excessive prices or been defrauded. 
    The city shall annually evaluate each institution's financial condition, credit worthiness and registrations to determine whether it should remain on its qualified institution list. 
    All financial institutions and broker/dealers must annually supply the finance director with an audited financial statement and all broker/dealers shall provide proof of National Association of Security Dealers certification. The finance director shall ensure that a current audited financial statement is on file for each financial institution and broker/dealer with which the city invests. 
(b)  Minority, emerging and community financial institutions. From time to time, the investment officer may choose to invest in instruments offered by minority, emerging and community financial institutions. All terms and relationships will be fully disclosed prior to purchase and will be reported to the appropriate entity on a consistent basis and should be consistent with state or local law. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.5. - Safekeeping and custody. 
(a)  Delivery vs. payment. All trades of marketable securities will be executed (cleared and settled) on a delivery vs. payment (DVP) basis to ensure that securities are deposited in the City's safekeeping institution prior to the release of funds. 
(b)  Third-party safekeeping. All securities shall be perfected in the name or for the account of the City of Lebanon and shall be held by a third-party custodian as evidenced by safekeeping receipts or reconciled statements. The safekeeping institution shall annually provide a copy of its most recent report on internal controls - service organization control reports (formerly 70, or SAS 70) prepared in accordance with the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 (effective June 15, 2011.) 
(c)  Internal controls. The city administrator or its designee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. 
    The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by investment officers. The internal controls shall address the following points at a minimum: 
(1)  Control of collusion; 
(2)  Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping; 
(3)  Custodial safekeeping; 
(4)  Avoidance of physical delivery securities; 
(5)  Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members; 
(6)  Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers; 
(7)  Dual authorizations of wire transfers; 
(8)  Staff training; and 
(9)  Review, maintenance and monitoring of security procedures both manual and automated. 
    The external auditor shall provide an annual independent review to assure compliance with state law, policies and procedures. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.6. - Suitable and authorized investments. 
(a)  Investment types and credit guidelines. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the cost of control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived, and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits require estimates and judgments by investment officers. 
(1)  U.S. Treasury and other government obligations that carry the full faith and credit guarantee of the United States for the payment of principal and interest; 
(2)  US Agency Securities that are issued or guaranteed by any agency of the United States Government as described in subsection (b); 
(3)  Bankers' acceptances issued by domestic commercial banks possessing the highest rating by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation; 
(4)  Collateralized public deposits (certificates of deposits) that are backed by acceptable collateral securities as dictated by state statute;

It is further limited to issued corporations that have total commercial paper program size in excess of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00); and 
(6)  Fully collateralized repurchase agreements, contractual agreements between the city and commercial banks or primary government security dealers. 
    If the credit rating of a security is subsequently downgraded below the minimum rating level for a new investment of that security, the investment officer shall evaluate the downgrade on a case-by-case basis in order to determine if the security should be held or sold. The investment officer will apply the general objectives of safety, liquidity, yield and legality to make the decision. 
(b)  Security selections. The following list represents the entire range of United States Agency Securities that the City of Lebanon will consider and which shall be authorized for the investment of funds by the City of Lebanon. Additionally, the following definitions and guidelines should be used in purchasing the instruments:

(6)  U.S. Government Mortgage Backed Securities. Restricted to securities with final maturities of ten (10) years. 
(c)  Investment restrictions and prohibited transactions. To provide for the safety and liquidity of the City of Lebanon's funds, the investment portfolio will be subject to the following restrictions: 
(1)  Borrowing for investment purposes ("leverage") is prohibited; 
(2)  Instruments known as Structured Notes (e.g. Inverse floaters, leveraged floaters, and equity-linked securities) are not permitted. Investment in any instrument, which is commonly considered a "derivative" instrument (e.g. options, futures, swaps, caps, floors, and collars), is prohibited; 
(3)  Contracting to sell securities not yet acquired in order to purchase other securities for purposes of speculating on developments or trends in the market is prohibited; and 
(4)  No more than five (5) percent of the total market value of the portfolio may be invested in bankers' acceptances issued by any one commercial bank and no more than five (5) percent of the total market value of the portfolio may be invested in commercial paper of any one issuer.

Securities will be delivered to the City of Lebanon's designated custodial agent. Funds and securities will be transferred on a delivery vs. payment basis. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.7. - Investment parameters. 
(a)  Diversification. It is the policy of the city to diversify its investment portfolios to minimize risk of loss resulting from the over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, issuer, or class of securities, assets in all [entity] funds shall be diversified by maturity, issuer, and class of security. Diversification strategies shall be determined and revised periodically by the investment officer. At a minimum diversification standards by security type and issuer shall be: 
(1)  U.S. treasuries and securities having principal and/or interest guaranteed by the U.S. government or U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored enterprises one hundred (100) percent. 
(2)  Collateralized time and demand deposits one hundred (100) percent. 
(3)  Collateralized repurchase agreements fifty (50) percent. 
(4)  U.S. Government agency callable securities no more than thirty (30) percent. 
(5)  Commercial paper no more than thirty (30) percent. 
(6)  Bankers' acceptances no more than thirty (30) percent. 
    Due to fluctuations in the aggregate surplus funds balance, maximum percentages for a particular issuer or investment type may be exceeded at a point in time subsequent to the purchase of a particular issuer or investment type. Securities need not be liquidated to realign the portfolio; however, consideration should be given to this matter when future purchases are made to ensure that appropriate diversification is maintained. 
(b)  Mitigating market risk in the portfolio. Market risk is the risk that the portfolio value will fluctuate due to changes in the general level of interest rates. The city recognizes that, over time, longer-term/core portfolios have the potential to achieve higher returns. On the other hand, longer-term portfolios have higher volatility of return. The city shall mitigate market risk by providing adequate liquidity for short-term cash needs, and by making longer-term investments only with funds that are not needed for current cash flow purposes. The city further recognizes that certain types of securities, including variable rate securities, securities with principal pay downs prior to maturity, and securities with embedded options, will affect the market risk profile of the portfolio differently in different interest rate environments. The city therefore, adopts the following strategies to control and mitigate its exposure to market risk: 
(1)  The city shall maintain a minimum of three (3) months of budgeted operating expenditures in short term investments to provide sufficient liquidity for expected disbursements; 
(2)  The City of Lebanon shall adopt weighted average maturity limitations that should not exceed five (5) years and are consistent with the investment objectives; 
(3)  Investments in bankers' acceptances and commercial paper shall mature and become payable not more than one hundred eighty days (180) from the date of purchase; 
(4)  The maximum stated final maturity of all other securities in the portfolio shall be five (5) years, except as otherwise stated in this policy; 
(5)  Liquidity funds will be held in money market instruments maturing one year and shorter; and 
(6)  Longer term/core funds will be the defined as the funds in excess of liquidity requirements. The investments in this portion of the portfolio will have maturities between one day and ten (10) years and will be only invested in higher quality and liquid securities. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.8. - Performance standards/ evaluation. 
    The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a market average rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. A series of appropriate benchmarks shall be established against which portfolio performance shall be compared on a regular basis. The benchmarks shall be reflective of the actual securities being purchased and risks undertaken and the benchmarks shall have a similar weighted average maturity and credit profile as the portfolio. 
    Commercial paper and bankers' acceptances must be reviewed monthly to determine if the rating level has changed. The commercial paper and bankers' MOC acceptances should be reviewed for possible sale if the securities are downgraded below the minimum acceptable rating levels. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.9. - Reporting/disclosure. 
(a)  Methods. The investment officer shall prepare an investment report at least quarterly, including a management summary that provides an analysis of the status of the current investment portfolio and the individual transactions executed over the last quarter. This management summary will be prepared in a manner which will allow the city to ascertain whether investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to the investment policy.

    The investment policy and any modifications to that policy shall be formally approved and adopted by the governing body of the city. 
( Ord. No. 5563 , § 1, 1-23-17) 
Sec. 2-470.11. - Securities acceptable as collateral to secure state deposits.

The City of Lebanon reserves the right to refuse to accept as collateral any security or securities on this list, or to request the submission of an alternate acceptable security or securities, if, in the sole discretion of the City of Lebanon, the City of Lebanon determines that such action will provide greater security for the deposit of city funds.

DIVISION 3. - DISCIPLINE AND GRIEVANCES 

Sec. 2-620. - Disciplinary action and offenses. 
    This policy and procedure sets forth guidelines for employee disciplinary actions. Each step builds on the former, thereby providing a progressive approach. Honest, straightforward communications, both verbal and written, is essential to the supervisor-employee relationship. 
    Conduct that interferes with operations, discredits the City of Lebanon, or is offensive or dangerous to others in the work place is grounds for discipline, whether or not such conduct is expressly prohibited by or in violation of any applicable rule, policy or directive. 
    Disciplinary action involving more than a verbal warning or counseling shall not be initiated without first consulting with the human resources department. A progressive discipline approach is the preferred method of resolution, however; certain circumstances may require a more severe resolution. In these circumstances, one or more steps may be bypassed straight to termination of employment. 
    The following are declared to be improper conduct and may be grounds for disciplinary action. This list is intended to serve as a guide to employees and department heads and is not inclusive.

(4)  Theft, attempted theft, misappropriation or willful damage to city property or the property of another person or entity; misappropriation, destruction theft, conversion or falsification of any record, report or information required by the city. 
(5)  Dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, exaggeration, or concealment of a material fact in connection with any official document or proceeding; withholding material facts in connection with matters under official investigation. 
(6)  Repeated failure or negligence in the care and handling of city property or equipment which causes damage to the property or equipment. 
(7)  Engaging in profane, lewd or offensive conduct or language toward members of the public, city officials, supervisors or other personnel.

(9)  Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace, unless authorized by the city.

Sec. 2-621. - Forms of discipline and procedures of appeals. 
    The City of Lebanon believes that a progressive discipline approach is in the best interest of the employee and the city. The employee progressive discipline procedure can begin at any discipline level, depending upon the nature and severity of the employee's conduct. This listing does not necessarily imply a required sequence. Employee discipline above a warning or counseling shall be initiated by the Human Resources department and any discipline shall become a part of the employee's permanent file. All actions will be kept confidential to the greatest extent as possible. 
(1)  Warning and counseling. A minor infraction of the City of Lebanon's Personnel Policies and Regulations Handbook and departmental policies shall result in the employee receiving a verbal or written warning from the supervisor or department head. The warning or counseling shall include a description of the deficiency and the corrective action taken by the supervisor or department head. If a supervisor or department head issues a warning or counseling, it shall be taken into consideration in the employee's next performance evaluation. The written warning or counseling shall be forwarded to the human resources department and shall become part of the employee's permanent file. Warnings and counseling are considered to be an administrative action and may not be appealed. An employee who receives a warning or counseling may submit a written response which shall accompany the warning or counseling in the permanent file. 
(2)  Written reprimand. A serious infraction of the City of Lebanon's Personnel Policies and Regulations Handbook or departmental policies shall result in the employee receiving a written reprimand from the supervisor or department head. Written reprimands shall only be initiated after the operational supervisor, division leader, or department head has consulted with the Human Resources department. A written reprimand is a written communication from the supervisor or department head to the employee which sets out the offense or deficiency and details the disciplinary action that was taken. An employee who is issued a written reprimand will be required to acknowledge receipt. The written reprimand and acknowledgement shall become part of the employee's permanent file. A copy of the written reprimand will be furnished to the employee. Written reprimands are considered to be an administrative action and may not be appealed. An employee who receives a written reprimand may submit a written response which shall accompany the written reprimand in the permanent file. 
(3)  Probation. Defined as a period of time, not to exceed six (6) months (unless authorized by the city administrator, where up to twelve (12) months' probation can be used), during which the employee is placed under enhanced supervision and regular observation of his or her performance and conduct. An employee is not eligible for pay increases or promotional opportunities during this period. Written notice of the probation shall cite the reasons for the probation and shall be provided to the employee. The employee will be required to acknowledge receipt. The written notice and the acknowledgement shall become part of the employee's permanent file. Department heads who are contemplating probation must consult the human resources department prior to taking action. Department heads contemplating probation exceeding six (6) months must consult the human resources department and obtain authorization from the city administrator prior to taking action. Probation may be appealed in accordance with the disciplinary appeal procedure. 
(4)  Suspension. An employee may be temporarily suspended from work without pay for a period not to exceed thirty (30) consecutive calendar days for any disciplinary offense or offenses, or pending the outcome of an investigation involving the employee. Upon approval of the city administrator, a suspension with pay may be invoked pending the outcome of an investigation. An employee will not be permitted to offset suspension time with accrued leave time. If found innocent or cleared, or if the suspension is overturned upon review or appeal, the employee's wages and benefits shall be retroactive to the date suspension commenced. Written notice of suspension shall cite the reasons for the suspension and the employee will be required to acknowledge receipt. The written notice and the acknowledgement shall become part of the employee's permanent file. Department heads who are contemplating suspension must consult with the human resources department and obtain authorization from the city administrator prior to taking action. Suspensions may be appealed in accordance to the disciplinary appeal procedure. 
(5)  Demotion. A department head, in consultation with the human resources department, may recommend to the city administrator that an employee receive a disciplinary demotion for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, by moving the employee to a position classification which has a lower salary. Written notice of the disciplinary demotion shall cite the reasons for the demotion, shall be provided to the employee and the employee will be required to acknowledge receipt. The written notice and the acknowledgement shall become part of the employee's permanent file. Demotions may be appealed in accordance to the disciplinary appeal procedure. 
(6)  Termination. A department head, in consultation with the Human Resources department, may recommend the termination of an employee. An employee may be terminated for one single serious violation of the City of Lebanon's Personnel Policies and Regulations Handbook or departmental policies or after the employee has failed to improve his work performance or correct his deficiencies. Termination of an employee will only occur after the review and approval of the action by the city administrator. The city administrator shall review all terminations. Written notice of the termination shall cite the reasons for the termination and shall be provided to the employee. The written notice shall become part of the employee's permanent file. Terminations may be appealed in accordance to the disciplinary appeal procedure.

( Ord. No. 5621 , § 5, 7-10-17) 
Sec. 2-623. - Grievance policy and procedures. 
    The city desires to resolve employee grievances promptly and fairly. A calm and sensible discussion between the employee and the immediate supervisor will usually resolve most employee problems. This sort of settlement, without bringing in a third party is, of course, the best way to settle most grievances. This can be done readily when both the supervisor and the employee adopt a proper attitude and show willingness to settle differences that may exist, intelligently and on a reasonable basis. 
    Employees are free to seek answers to any questions and adjustments of any grievances without discrimination, coercion, restraint, or reprisal. Supervisors and higher authorities shall see that all questions, complaints, and grievances receive prompt, impartial, and systematic consideration in attempting to reach satisfactory adjustments. 
    If a situation occurs when you believe that a condition of employment or a decision that affects you is not fair, you are encouraged to use the following problem resolution steps. You may stop the procedure at any step. 
    In the event the employee elects to process the facts of the grievance through an alternate process (lawsuit, charge of discrimination, etc.) the city may elect to terminate the processing of the employee's grievance to allow it to be handled in the alternate forum selected by the employee. 
(1)  Step 1-First line of supervision. 
a.  Informal discussion of grievance. An attempt should be made to resolve any alleged grievance in an informal discussion between the employee who is the grievant and the person in the first line of supervision. An informal answer or adjustment of a question or complaint concluded between an employee and the first line supervision shall not establish a precedent in any comparable situation. 
b.  Filing of grievance with the division supervisor. If the grievant is not satisfied with the resolution of the grievance after the informal discussion outlined above, the grievant may file a grievance, in writing, on a form prepared for this purpose, with the division supervisor within ten (10) business days after the date of occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or after such date first became known to the grievant. 
1.  The written grievance shall provide a description of the facts that all alleged to give rise to the grievance and shall state the remedy requested. 
2.  Within five (5) business days after the division supervisor receives the written grievance, a meeting shall be held with the grievant and the department supervisor at a mutually agreeable time other than when the employee is engaged in assigned duties, to discuss the grievance and attempt to resolve the same. 
3.  The division supervisor shall render a decision and communicate it in writing to the grievant and the human resource director within five (5) business days following the meeting between that person and the grievant. 
(2)  Step 2-Division supervisor and human resource director. 
a.  Filing a grievance with the division supervisor and human resource director. If the grievant is not satisfied with the resolution of the grievance at Step 1, or if no decision has been rendered, the grievant may present the grievance to the division supervisor and human resource director. The grievance shall be presented in writing within five (5) business days after the decision at Step 1, or ten (10) business days after the meeting between the grievant and the division supervisor if no decision was rendered. 
b.  Meeting with the division supervisor and human resource director. Within five (5) business days after the grievance is filed with the division supervisor and human resource director, a meeting shall be held with the grievant and the division supervisor and human resource director, in an effort to resolve the grievance. 
c.  Decision of the division supervisor and human resource director. The division supervisor and human resource director shall give an answer within five (5) business days of the meeting and communicate it in writing to the grievant and the department supervisor. 
(3)  Step 3-City administrator. 
a.  Filing of grievance with the city administrator. If the grievant is not satisfied with the resolution of the grievance at Step 2, or if no decision has been rendered, the grievant may appeal the grievance to the city administrator. The grievance shall be presented in writing within five (5) business days after the decision at Step 2, or ten (10) business days after the meeting between the grievant and the department head or human resource director if no decision was rendered. 
b.  Meeting with the city administrator. Within five (5) business days after the grievance is filed with the city administrator, a meeting shall be held with the grievant and the city administrator, in an effort to resolve the grievance. 
c.  Decision by the city administrator. The city administrator shall give an answer within five (5) business days of the meeting and communicate it in writing to the grievant, department supervisor, department head, and human resource director. 
(4)  Step 4-Appeal to the personnel board. 
a.  Appeal to the personnel board. In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the resolution of the grievance at Step 3, or if no decision has been rendered by the city administrator, the grievant may appeal to the personnel board. 
b.  The personnel board shall consider and decide the grievant's appeal in closed session and may accept, reject, or modify any previous determination made on the grievance. 
c.  The personnel board may, in its discretion, elect to hear the appeal by receiving written submissions from the grievant and the mayor or city administrator; listening to oral presentations by the grievant and the supervision; or it may decide the appeal on the documents and decisions made at Steps 1 through 3 of this procedure. 
d.  Where the grievance involves discipline or termination, the employee may elect to have a hearing before the personnel board. 
e.  The decision of the personnel board shall be final and binding upon all parties to the grievance procedure. The personnel board shall notify the grievant in writing as to its decision within ten (10) business days after a final vote is taken concerning the appeal of the grievance.

b.  The city shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds received under subdivision (a) of this subsection to the insured or as the terms of the policy and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such insurance moneys, unless the city has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of subsection (7) of this section.

(9)  If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in subsection (8) of this section, at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from date of its insurance shall be a lien on the property and a personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid. 
(10)  Subsection (8) of this section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and structures.

Chapter 11 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4765, § 1, adopted September 13, 2010, repealed the former chapter 11, §§ 11-1-11-12, 11-31-11-34, 11-51-11-56 and 11-60, and enacted a new chapter 11 as set out herein. The former chapter 11 pertained to flood damage prevention and derived from Ord. No. 3288, adopted March 28, 1988; Ord. No. 3494, adopted March 15, 1993 and Ord. No. 4730, adopted June 14, 2010. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 11-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMO 77.260 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Lebanon, Missouri ordains as follows in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4765, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 11-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated September 29, 2010 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(e)  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 4765, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 11-3. - Statement of purpose 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 11-2(a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 4765, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 11-26. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Lebanon, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 4765, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 11-27. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
(Ord. No. 4765, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 11-55. - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b) through (f) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97; Ord. No. 3939, § 1, 6-14-99) 
Sec. 13-21. - Code enforcement official to determine when weeds, etc., constitute public nuisance.

(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97) 
Sec. 13-22. - Weeds, etc., over twelve inches in height declared nuisance per se.

(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97; Ord. No. 3939, § 2, 6-14-99) 
Sec. 13-23. - Permitting growth of high weeds, etc., prohibited.

In the event any of the other aforesaid plants, vehicles, structures or other obstructions which are otherwise permitted in this chapter equal or exceed eighteen (18) inches or more in height, then it shall be presumed that the same obstructs the view to the operator of the aforesaid vehicles in which case the city shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not the said obstruction shall be permitted in the sight triangle. This determination shall be based upon the geometry of the land taking safety factors into account; the purpose of this section is to prohibit objects in the sight triangle that obstruct the view of the operators of vehicles. It is intended that the sight triangles will serve to provide a viewing distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet from the intersecting street, alley, drive and/or other entrance. 
(b)  A "sight triangle" is defined as a triangle formed by the intersection of public streets, alleys, drives and/or other entrances to through streets where the triangle area is that area encompassed within two intersecting lines formed by the edge of the pavement, curb, roadway, or projection thereof, and extending sixty (60) feet down the through street from the right edge of the intersecting street, drive and/or entrance, when standing in the street, alley, drive, and/or other entrance facing the through street and extending fifteen (15) feet from the edge of the pavement, curb, roadway or projection thereof of the intersecting street, alley, drive and/or other entrance and the third imaginary line connecting the extremities of the other two (2). 
    On the left side of the intersecting street, alley, drive, and/or other entrance, the triangle shall be calculated by measuring one hundred (100) feet down the through street from the edge of the intersecting street, alley, drive, and/or other entrance and measuring fifteen (15) feet down the intersecting street, alley, drive, and/or other entrance from the edge of the through street, and a third imaginary line connecting the extremities of the other two.

ARTICLE IV. - DEFACEMENT OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROPERTY 

Sec. 13-36. - Graffiti. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. Graffiti on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such malicious vandalism, but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties, and in so doing, negatively impacts upon the entire community. The city has in the past undertaken to remove graffiti from public property but has been unable to mount a successful program for encouraging the owners of private property to undertake to remove graffiti and other inscribed materials from walls, structures, etc. The legislation of the State of Missouri has authorized the city to define, regulate, suppress, and prevent nuisance and to declare what shall constitute a nuisance and to abate and remove the same. 
(b)  Legislative determination. The city council finds and determines that graffiti is a nuisance and unless it and other inscribed material is removed from public and private properties, it tends to remain; and other properties are then in the target of the graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods and indeed the community is depreciated in value and made a less desirable place to be. The city council therefore determines that it is appropriate that the city develop procedures to implement an ordinance and to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed material from both public and private property under the circumstances set forth hereinafter. 
The city council hereby declares as a matter of legislative determination that: 
(1)  The increasing incidents of the defacement of public and private property through the application of graffiti upon walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, other structures, trees and other real and personal property within the corporate boundaries of the city constitutes a blight on this community, and, in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents and taxpayers of the city, immediate steps must be taken to remove this blight. 
(2)  When appropriate, the courts should require those who commit acts of defacement of public or private property through the application of graffiti to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. 
(3)  Obtaining convictions for the application of graffiti is difficult to the fact that the offense can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the act are frequently nonexistent. 
(c)  Definitions. Whenever the following terms are used in this chapter, they shall have the meaning established by this section: 
(1)  "Graffiti" means the defacing, damaging, or destroying by spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public and private buildings, structures, and places. 
(2)  "Graffiti abatement procedure" means an abatement procedure which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response. 
(3)  "Private contractor" means any person with whom the City shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. 
(d)  Graffiti-Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as "graffiti" within the city. 
(e)  Same-Violation; penalty. Any person who is convicted of violating subsection (d) above shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed three (3) months or both such fine and imprisonment. In addition to such punishment, the court may, in imposing sentence, order the defendant to restore the property so defaced, damages or destroyed. 
(f)  Same-Notice of removal. Whenever the code enforcement official or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti exists on any public and private buildings, structures and places which are visible to any person utilizing any public right of way in this city, be this road, parkway, alley, or otherwise, the code enforcement official or his/her designated representative shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. In the event painting of exterior surfaces is the only means by which abatement can be accomplished, additional time may be granted by the code enforcement official if seasonal temperatures would preclude abatement within the usual time frame outlined in section 13-40. Notice and abatement procedure outlined in section 13-40 may be used in lieu of or in addition to any other procedure available under this chapter. Such notice shall not be required as prerequisite to a violation of section 13-1.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 4138, § 1, adopted Aug. 26, 2002, amended the Code by renumbering Art. IV as Art. V. 

Sec. 13-40. - Abatement procedure. 
(a)  Notice to owner, occupant or person in possession to abate. Whenever the code enforcement official receives a complaint or is otherwise informed and believes that a nuisance exists under this chapter, he shall notify the owner, occupant and person in possession, (if the same is a person different than the owner), of the property that a hearing before the hearing officer shall be held in the council chambers at the city hall ten (10) days after notice of the same is personally delivered, mailed or posted as provided below at which hearing, the hearing officer may declare that a nuisance exists and order the same to be abated within five (5) days after the hearing. If the nuisance is on private property, proof that a person occupies the property or that a person has possession or right of possession of the property shall constitute prima facie evidence for purposes of this chapter that such person has caused, maintained or permitted the nuisance; and such person and the owner, if different from the occupant or person in possession, shall be responsible for its abatement. 
    Such notification may be made by any one (1) of the following methods: 
(1)  Delivery of the notice to the owner and the person occupying or having possession of the property if different than the owner; or 
(2)  Depositing in the United States mail, postage prepaid, the notice addressed to the owner and the person occupying or having possession or the right to possession of the property if different than the owner; or 
(3)  If such property is not occupied, the code enforcement official shall notify the owners by posting a notice of his request to abate or remove such nuisance within a time to be specified in such notice upon such property and shall send a copy of such notice by registered mail to the last known address of the owners; or 
(4)  If such property is not occupied and the owner is unknown or cannot be located, then the code enforcement official shall post a notice containing an order to abate the nuisance on the property where such nuisance exists; or 
(5)  By delivery of a notice or by depositing in the United States mail, postage prepaid, a notice to the person causing, maintaining or permitting a nuisance. 
(b)  Order to abate. If, upon a hearing for the violation of this article, the hearing officer finds that a violation exists and that proper notice has been given as provided for in this article, and that there has been a failure to abate the nuisance, the hearing officer shall make an order directing the code enforcement official to abate such nuisance forthwith. 
(c)  Abatement by city upon failure of owner, occupant or person in possession to comply. If an order to abate is issued as provided above in the previous subsection and the abatement has not occurred within five (5) days from the date of the order, then the code enforcement official shall effect the abatement of such nuisance by whatever reasonable means are necessary. 
(d)  Liability for costs; lien. The cost for abating the said nuisance shall be computed by the code enforcement official, who shall certify all costs of the same to the city clerk who shall cause a special tax bill therefor to be prepared and issued against the real estate involved and to cause the same to be collected by the collector of the County of Laclede, together with other taxes assessed against the said property; each special tax bill shall be issued by the city clerk and delivered to the collector on or before the first day of June of each year and such tax bill shall bear interest a the rate of eight (8) percent per annum pursuant to the provisions of Section 71.285, R.S.Mo. Said tax bill shall be a first lien on the said real estate until paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its validity and no mere clerical error or informality in the same or in the proceedings leading up the issuance shall be a defense thereto. 
(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97) 
Sec. 13-41. - Additional remedies for abatement of nuisances. 
(a)  Warrants issued by municipal court. The judge of the municipal court, upon application of the city attorney or the code enforcement official and upon a showing that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of any provision of this chapter exists, and that said violation constitutes a threat to public health, welfare or safety and that there is probable cause to believe that evidence of such violation may be found at a specified location, may issue a warrant, which shall be served by the code enforcement official. If the code enforcement official is not a police officer, he shall serve the warrant in the company of a uniformed officer of the city police department. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be seized on the property. 
(b)  Injunctive powers. In addition to the penalties set froth in this chapter, the code enforcement official is hereby authorized to file and obtain injunctions on behalf of the city against persons who are violating provisions of this chapter. In the event the city seeks injunctive relief from the circuit court for violations of this chapter, penalty provisions set forth in this chapter shall not apply. The city council finds and declares that the remedies set forth in this chapter may be inadequate to protect the public health, safety and welfare from violations which are continuous or violations that are repeated. 
(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97) 
Sec. 13-42. - Assessment of court costs upon finding of violation. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if, upon a trial for the violation of this article, the judge of the municipal court shall find that a violation exists and that the defendant has had proper notice, as provided in this chapter, and the defendant has failed to abate the nuisance, the judge of the municipal court shall have the right, in addition to the penalty for violating this chapter, to enter an order directing the code enforcement official to abate such nuisance forthwith, and immediately report the expense thereof to the judge of the municipal court, who shall, as a part of the costs of such prosecution, render judgment against the defendant for the amount of such expense, which shall be collected as other fines and costs. 
(Ord. No. 3786, § 1, 5-12-97) 
Sec. 13-43. - Minimum charges to abate nuisance. 
    Whenever the city is required to abate a nuisance under the provisions of this chapter, there shall be a minimum charge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the expenses incurred by the city for the abatement of the nuisance. In addition to the minimum charge of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the city shall charge the actual cost of abatement of the nuisance.

(6)  When the alarm is caused by natural or man-made catastrophe, or an act of God, including such events as tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, or other similar violent conditions. 
(b)  All false alarms as defined herein, to which the department responds, after the fifth false alarm in a one-year period, shall result in a fine, as set forth in the following schedule:

(2)  Twelfth false alarm and each false alarm call thereafter from a facility other than a residence within one-year period, fifty dollars ($50.00) per call. 
(3)  Sixth false alarm from a residence within one-year period, fifteen dollars ($15.00) per false alarm call and fifteen dollars ($15.00) per call for each false alarm call thereafter, to and including the eleventh call.

    Upon a determination by the department that more than five (5) false alarms have occurred, the department shall send a notice to the alarm user notifying the alarm user of the determination and directing payment within thirty (30) days. For the first five (5) calls, the determination of the department shall be deemed to be conclusive as to whether or not a false alarm has occurred. The department may consider, in determining whether or not the first five (5) calls are false alarms, any written or oral statement that the alarm user submits, provided such statement is provided within thirty (30) days after the date of notice for the sixth false alarm. Since no penalties accrue for the first five (5) calls, it has been determined as a legislative matter, that for administrative convenience there shall be no right to notice nor a right to contest or appeal the determination of the department for the first five (5) calls. 
(d)  Any alarm user who has had an alarm system installed for less than six (6) months shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in this section, nor shall any alarm that occurs within the first six (6) months after installation be counted in determining whether more than five (5) false alarms have occurred, provided:

In the event such information has been submitted to the department and the department determines that the alarm did not take place within the first six (6) months after installation of the alarm system, then the alarm user shall be subject to the penalties set forth in this section. The alarm user may raise, as a defense to prosecution under the section, that the false alarm took place within the first six (6) months after the alarm system was installed, provided the alarm user raised the issue and submitted proof to the department concerning the date of installation as required herein. The alarm user shall have the burden of proving such defense. 
(e)  The department may cancel any notice or fine upon satisfactory proof by the alarm user that a particular alarm falls within the exceptions enumerated in section 14-23.2(a). 
(f)  Willful refusal to pay the fine within thirty (30) days of notice shall constitute a violation of this chapter, but in any prosecution under section 14-23.2(h) for violation of this provision, the city shall prove, in addition to the willful refusal to pay, that the fine was properly imposed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the court from imposing a fine that is higher than the civil penalty established in section 14-23.2. 
(g)  In addition to the penalties set forth above, the department may notify an alarm user who has more than twenty (20) false burglar alarm calls within one year that the alarm system constitutes a public nuisance. The notice may direct the alarm user to take action to correct the matter within a certain time. In the event the alarm system is not corrected within such time and additional false burglar alarms are received, the department may order the burglar alarm system removed or disconnected. Each and every day that the system is maintained in violation of the order shall constitute a separate offense. 
(h)  Any person who violates or causes a violation of any provision of this section shall be punished, upon conviction, in accordance with provisions of section 1-12 of the City Code.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 3386, §§ 1-27 and §§ 29, 30, adopted August 13, 1990, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore, inclusion as Art. II, §§ 17-21-17-49, was at the discretion of the editor. This article shall be in full force and effect from and after the time of its passage. 

Sec. 17-21. - Determination of necessity for article. 
    It is hereby determined and declared by the council that in certain portions of the city there are obsolete, decadent, substandard, unsanitary or blighted areas which because of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design or physical deterioration, as well as inadequate planning, lack of proper light, air or open space and defective building arrangements, have impaired economic value and that these areas have become economic and social liabilities to the city and its citizens. These areas are characterized by depreciated real property values with reduced or negligible income potential and consequent inability to pay reasonable taxes, and are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime. Such obsolete, substandard, unsanitary and blighted areas constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the city. These poor conditions occur frequently in areas which are subdivided into small parcels with multiple owners where there is frequent confusion as to who owns individual parcels. The council further determines and declares that individuals would find it difficult and costly to assemble parcels of land for the purpose of clearing, replanning, rehabilitating, reconstructing and redeveloping these areas and that the failure to clear, replan, rehabilitate, reconstruct or redevelop these areas results in progressive deterioration of the city as a whole, continued decline in the city's population, and excessive and wasteful expenditures of public funds for policing, sanitation and other public services. The council further determines and declares that such conditions can be improved but that improvement may require the investment of large amounts of capital so that adequate parcels of land can be acquired at fair prices, such areas can be cleared by demolishing existing old, obsolete, inadequate, unsafe or unsanitary buildings, and such areas can be redeveloped using appropriate land use planning under proper supervision. The large scale redevelopment of these areas is necessary for the public welfare and constitutes public uses and purposes for which the city may acquire private property by purchase or eminent domain. Therefore, the provisions hereby enacted are declared as a matter of legislative determination to be in the public interest. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 1, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-22. - Acceptance of application of state enabling act.

At such meeting, a date shall be set for a public hearing thereon. 
(b)  After a public hearing has been held upon the development plan, and after the commission has submitted its report thereon, the council shall:

Sec. 17-37. - Findings and declarations of council. 
    In any ordinance approving a development plan, the council shall make the following findings and declarations:

(3)  That approval of the development plan and construction of the redevelopment project are necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, morals and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 17, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-38. - Certificate of public convenience and necessity for corporation to acquire property by eminent domain. 
    If the redevelopment corporation proposing a development plan seeks to acquire by eminent domain in its own name all or any part of the real property described in the development plan, the council shall, by ordinance, determine that the public convenience and necessity will be served by the development plan and redevelopment project, and grant to such redevelopment corporation a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing and empowering the redevelopment corporation to acquire by the exercise of eminent domain such real property in fee simple or other estate; provided that such real property shall be devoted to the purposes and used subject to the conditions described in the development plan. Such redevelopment corporation may thereafter exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by any other applicable statutory provision. Property already devoted to a public use may be acquired in like manner, provided that no real property belonging to the city or to the state or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired without its consent. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 18, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-39. - Deposit when city acquires property for corporation. 
(a)  Amount. If the person or redevelopment corporation proposing a development plan seeks to have the city acquire by eminent domain or otherwise, and/or thereafter clear all or any part of the real property described in the development plan, such person or redevelopment corporation shall, at the time hereinafter provided, deposit in escrow with the city, subject to the provisions of this article or any ordinance, a sum of money in cash or negotiable federal or municipal securities of a cash market value equal to the cost estimated by the commission to be incurred by the city in acquiring, or, if the clearance thereof is also sought, in acquiring and clearing such real property, conditioned as hereafter provided that such deposit shall constitute a bid for such real property is offered for sale or lease by the city. Such bid shall equal the actual cost incurred by the city in acquiring or in acquiring and clearing such real property, and shall be applied as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  Return of deposit. If the person or redevelopment corporation making any such deposit is not the successful bidder for such real property, after it has been acquired or acquired and cleared by the city, then such deposit shall be returned by the city to the person or redevelopment corporation making such deposit. 
(c)  "Cost" defined. By the term "cost" as used in this section and section 17-40 is meant all expenditures by the city, including what is paid for such real property and the clearance thereof, appraisal, abstract, title and recording fees, court costs, witness fees, fees of the commission, and all other expenses of acquiring and clearing such property. 
(d)  Custody of securities. All securities deposited in escrow with the city shall be promptly placed in a safety deposit box under the joint control of the mayor and the city's treasurer. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 19, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-40. - Acquisition, resale of property by city. 
(a)  Within ten (10) days after the council shall have approved any development plan calling for the acquisition by the city by the exercise of the power of eminent domain or otherwise of all or any part of the real property described therein, the person or redevelopment corporation submitting such plan shall deposit in escrow with the city the cash amounts or securities required by section 17-39. Thereafter the council shall determine by ordinance whether the real property described in such development plan constitutes a blighted area and should in the public interest be redeveloped, and the council may provide that the city acquire such property and procure the fee simple title thereto by purchase, by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or by other means. The payment therefor by the city, in whole or in part, may be made out of the general funds of the city, or in whole or in part, by general obligation bonds or the proceeds of general obligation bonds. The city shall then proceed to acquire such real property in accordance with such ordinance. Whenever any real property, land, easement, right-of-way, use or right of any character is taken or damaged by the city for such purpose, just compensation shall be paid to the owner thereof in accordance with the ordinances and applicable state law. 
(b)  After acquiring the title to such real property, the city shall sell such real property and all interest therein for the purpose of redevelopment, as hereinafter provided, subject to such restrictions, exceptions and conditions as may be recommended by the commission, or which the council deems to be in the public interest. 
(c)  No bid shall be considered by the council unless the bidder shall have made the escrow deposit required in section 17-39 within the time required by this section. 
(d)  If there be but one qualified bidder, such real property shall be sold to such bidder at not less than the acquisition of such real property to the city. If there be more than one qualified bidder, such real property shall be sold to the highest and best bidder. If any profit on such sale is realized by the city, such profit shall be credited to the general fund. Each sale shall be approved by the council. The deposit of the successful bidder shall be applied upon the purchase price, and the city shall give due credit therefor. When such deposit is represented by securities, the city shall immediately sell the same at the current market price thereof at private sale for cash and apply the proceeds to the selling price of such real property. If such deposit should prove to be insufficient to equal the actual cost to the city of such real property, when such cost is determined after purchase, or by action of a condemnation jury, or otherwise, as the case may be, then such persons shall make an additional deposit with the city, upon ten (10) days' written notice from the mayor, of a sum of money in cash equal to such additional acquisition cost as so determined, and failing to make such additional deposit, the city may, at its option, thereupon repeal the ordinance providing for the acquisition of such real property and dismiss the pending condemnation proceedings, if any. In such last event, the expenses of such uncompleted acquisition and condemnation proceedings, if any, shall be charged to and paid by the person or redevelopment corporation so making such deposit and the amount thereof shall be withheld by the city from the funds or securities deposited in escrow, and applied to the payment of such expenses, and if more than one deposit has been made, then each person so making a deposit shall be charged equally for his share of such costs. The balance of such funds and securities so deposited in escrow shall then be returned to the owner thereof. Sale of such securities may be made only upon order of the council by resolution or ordinance.

(2)  All amounts paid for taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and other similar charges; and 
(3)  An annual amount sufficient to amortize the cost of the entire project at the end of the period, which shall be not less than twenty (20) years nor more than sixty (60) years from date of completion of the redevelopment project.

(2)  May be used to accelerate the amortization payments; or 
(3)  May be used for the enlargement of the redevelopment project; or 
(4)  May be used for reduction in rentals therein; provided, that at the termination of the tax relief granted pursuant to section 17-46, the redevelopment corporation shall make a strict accounting of surplus earnings and shall turn over to the city any excess of such surplus earnings not previously used as provided in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 22, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-43. - Insurance companies as redevelopment corporations.

(2)  For use in the maintenance or enlargement of the redevelopment project; or 
(3)  For reduction in rentals charged tenants thereof.

(a)  Acquisition of property. A redevelopment corporation may acquire real property or secure options in its own name, or in the name of nominees, and it may acquire real property by gift, grant, lease, purchase or otherwise. 
(b)  Incumbrance of property. A redevelopment corporation may borrow funds and secure the repayment thereof by mortgage, which shall contain reasonable amortization provisions and shall be a lien upon no other real property except property forming the whole or a part of a single development area. Any mortgage on the real property in a development area, or any part thereof, may create a first lien, or a second or junior lien, upon such real property. 
(c)  Disposal of property. A redevelopment corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of the real property acquired by it for the purpose of a redevelopment project. The ordinance approving any development plan, and any contract entered into pursuant thereto, may provide that in the event of the sale or other disposition of real property of any redevelopment corporation by reason of the foreclosure on any mortgage or other lien through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, or by order of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by voluntary transfer or otherwise, the tax relief provided under section 17-46 of this article shall inure to any purchaser of such real property so long as such purchaser shall continue to use, operate and maintain such real property in accordance with the provisions of the development plan. If such ordinance and contract do not so provide and the purchaser of such real property shall continue to use, operate and maintain such real property in accordance with the provisions of the redevelopment plan, the council may grant the tax relief provided in section 17-46. If such real property shall be used for a purpose different than that described in the redevelopment plan, or if the purchaser does not desire the property to continue under the redevelopment plan, or if the ordinance approving the plan does not provide for continuing tax relief and the council shall refuse to grant the purchaser continuing tax relief, the real property shall be assessed for ad valorem taxes upon the full true value of the real property and may be owned and operated free from any of the conditions, restrictions or provisions of this article and the Urban Redevelopment Corporations Law. 
(Ord. No. 3386, § 25, 8-13-90) 
Sec. 17-46. - Tax relief for redevelopment corporations. 
(a)  Full exemption. The real property of a redevelopment corporation which is acquired pursuant to this article shall not be subject to assessment of payment of general and ad valorem taxes imposed by the city or by the state or any political subdivision thereof for a period of ten (10) years after the date upon which such redevelopment corporation became owner of such real property measured solely by the amount of the assessed valuation of the land, exclusive of improvements, acquired pursuant to this article and owned by such redevelopment corporation, as was determined by the assessor of Laclede County, for taxes due and payable thereon during the calendar year during which the redevelopment corporation acquired title to such real property; and the amounts of such tax assessments shall not be increased by the city or by the state or by any political subdivision thereof during such ten-year period so long as the real property is owned by a redevelopment corporation or its permitted successors and assigns and used in accordance with a development plan authorized by the council. 
(b)  Property already exempt. In the event, however, that any such real property was tax exempt immediately prior to ownership by any such redevelopment corporation, the commission shall immediately request such county assessor to promptly assess such land, exclusive of improvements, in accordance with the provisions of Section 110 of the Urban Redevelopment Corporations Law. The amount of such assessed valuation so fixed by the county assessor shall not be increased by the city or by the state or by any political subdivision thereof during the ten-year period next following the date upon which the corporation acquired ownership thereof, so long as such real property is owned by the redevelopment corporation and used in accordance with the development plan authorized and approved by the council. 
(c)  Partial exemption. For the next ensuring period of fifteen (15) years, all ad valorem taxes upon such real property shall be measured by the assessed valuation thereof as determined by the county assessor upon the basis of and not to exceed fifty (50) percent of the true value of such real property, including any improvements thereon, nor shall such valuations be increased over fifty (50) percent of the true value of such real property from year to year during the period of fifteen (15) years, so long as such real property is owned by a redevelopment corporation and used in accordance with an authorized development plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Missouri Redevelopment Corporation Law, the redevelopment corporation and the council may agree that such real property may be fully assessed for all or part of the term of partial exemption. 
(d)  Full assessment. After such periods, totaling twenty-five (25) years, such real property shall be subject to assessment by the city and payment of all ad valorem taxes based on the full true value of the real property, and shall be owned and operated by the redevelopment corporation free from the conditions, restrictions and provisions of this article, the approving ordinance and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article; provided that at any time after the completion of the redevelopment project, as authorized by ordinance, the redevelopment corporation may elect to pay to the city a sum equivalent to the amount of the general ad valorem taxes, not including interest or penalties, which would have been levied on the full value of the property from the date of the completion of the project, and from that date such real property shall be owned and operated by the redevelopment corporation free from the conditions, restrictions and provisions of this article, the approving ordinance and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article.

(b)  Exception. If any person or redevelopment corporation shall propose more than one redevelopment plan and such plans are approved as provided in this article, the failure to comply with one or more such plans within the time limits and in the manner for the completion of each stage thereof as therein stated shall not give the city any right of action with respect to plans which have been fully complied with within the limits and in the manner for the completion of each stage thereof as therein stated; and the real property included in such plans which have been fully complied with shall be entitled to the tax relief provided for in this article.

(4)  The landlord cannot raise the rent because of the rehab work performed except an amount that is not in excess of the Consumer Price Index for one year. Any rents raised must be reported to the city. 
(5)  If the rent charged is over Fair Market Rents, the house will not be rehabbed until the landlord and the tenant have entered into a rent agreement showing the rent will be at or below Fair Market Rent. 
(d)  A complete house inspection will be made by the program housing inspector. A work write-up will be prepared, as well as a cost estimate. All decisions concerning repairs to be made to the structure will be made by the program manager with the right of appeal by the owner to the mayor.

If the sign or the condition constituting the violation is on private property, proof that a person occupies the property or that a person has possession or right of possession of the property shall constitute prima facie evidence for purposes of this chapter that such person has caused, maintained or permitted the violation; and such person and the owner, if different from the occupant or person in possession, shall be responsible for the removal of the sign or correction of the violation. 
    Such notification may be made by any one (1) of the following methods:

(2)  Depositing in the United States mail, postage prepaid, the notice addressed to the owner and the person occupying or having possession or the right to possession of the property if different than the owner; or 
(3)  If such property is not occupied, the code enforcement official shall notify the owners by posting a notice of his request to abate or remove such violation within a time to be specified in such notice upon such property and shall send a copy of such notice by registered mail to the last known address of the owners; or 
(4)  If such property is not occupied and the owner is unknown or cannot be located, the code enforcement official shall post a notice containing an order to abate the violation on the property where such violation exists; or 
(5)  By delivery of a notice or by depositing in the United States mail, postage prepaid, a notice to the person causing, maintaining or permitting a violation. 
(b)  Order to abate. If, upon a hearing for the violation of this chapter, the hearing officer finds that a violation exists and that proper notice has been given as provided for in this article, and that there has been a failure to remove the sign or correct the violation, the hearing officer shall make an order directing the code enforcement official to remove the sign or correct the violation forthwith. 
(c)  Abatement by city upon failure of owner, occupant or person in possession to comply. If an order to remove the sign or correct the violation is issued as provided above in the previous subsection and the corrective action has not occurred within five (5) days from the date of the order, then the code enforcement official shall effect the corrective action by whatever reasonable means are necessary. 
(d)  Liability for costs; lien.

Sec. 20-5. - Additional remedies for abatement of violation. 
(a)  Warrants issued by municipal court. The judge of the municipal court, upon application of the city attorney or the code enforcement official and upon a showing that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of any provision of this chapter exists, and that said violation constitutes a threat to public health, welfare or safety and that there is probable cause to believe that evidence of such violation may be found at a specified location, may issue a warrant, which shall be served by the code enforcement official. If the code enforcement official is not a police officer, he shall serve the warrant in the company of a uniformed officer of the city police department.

The arrangement, character, extend, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the city's comprehensive plan and zoning regulations and access management guidelines as set forth in Appendix B of the Code, and shall be considered in their relationship to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Where not shown on the comprehensive plan and zoning regulations, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to the provisions found in this section and access management guidelines as set forth in Appendix B of the Code. 
(b)  Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas. 
(c)  Projection of streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of streets. 
(d)  Streets to be carried to property lines. When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible of being subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided. 
(e)  Street jogs prohibited. Street jogs with centerline offset of less than one hundred (100) feet shall be avoided. 
(f)  Dead-end street or cul-de-sac. Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than eight hundred (800) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least sixty (60) feet, and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar turn-around shall be provided and provision made for future extension of the street into adjoining properties. (See Exhibit A at the end of this chapter). 
(g)  Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing arterial street, the zoning and planning commission may require marginal access streets or other such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(h)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(i)  Street widths. Street widths shall not be less than as follows: 
  Width,
Street type     in feet 
Arterial ..... 66 
Collector ..... 60 
Minor, for row houses and apartments ..... 60 
Minor, for other residences ..... 60 
Marginal access ..... 60 
(See Exhibit A). 
In front of areas designed and zoned or where a petition for a change in zoning is contemplated for commercial use, to permit such use, the street width shall be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by the zoning and planning commission to assure the free flow of through traffic without interference by parked or parking vehicles and to provide safe parking space for such commercial and business district. 
(j)  Intersection. The intersection of more than two (2) streets at one point shall be avoided except where it is impracticable to secure a proper street system otherwise. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near to a right angle as possible, and no intersections of streets at angles less than sixty (60) degrees shall be approved. 
(k)  Street deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a slight distance of not less than one hundred (100) feet for minor and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the zoning and planning commission shall determine for special cases. 
(l)  Reverse curves. A tangent at least fifty (50) feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(m)  Subdivision into tracts larger than ordinary building lots. Where a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision. 
(n)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except under conditions approved by the zoning and planning commission. 
(o)  Street grades. No street grade shall be less than four percent and shall not exceed the following, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves: 
Percent grade,
 Street type       in percent 
Arterial ..... 10 
Collector ..... 15 
Minor ..... 15 
Marginal Access ..... 15 
(See Exhibit A). 
(p)  Railroad on or abutting subdivision. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the zoning and planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(q)  Half-streets prohibited. Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the zoning and planning commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(r)  Street names and numbers. Names and new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names unless a new street is a continuation of, or in alignment with the existing or platted street. All new streets shall be named in coordination with the building inspector. 
(s)  Access to streets across ditches. The subdivider shall provide access to all proposed streets, across all ditches, in a standard method approved by the city engineer. 
(t)  Vacation of streets. The zoning and planning commission shall not recommend the vacation of any street or part of a street dedicated for public use, if such vacation interferes with the uniformity of the existing street pattern of any future street plans prepared for the area. 
(u)  Private streets. Private streets shall not be approved nor shall public improvements be approved for any private street. 
(v)  Hardship to owners of adjoining property avoided. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. 
(w)  Street interval. In general, provisions should be made for through streets at intervals not exceeding six hundred sixty (660) feet, except as provided for in Appendix B of the Code.

(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

(2)  Steady yellow indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this article, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown. 
b.  The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the city traffic engineer may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require. This prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at the intersection giving notice thereof. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this article, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(4)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made but, in the absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past the signal only with caution.

These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city. 
(e)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, DNR and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operation. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, DNR and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(f)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
The city shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper published in Lebanon, Missouri a list of any industrial users which were in violation of any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. 
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city until and unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user. 
All information collected by the city under its pretreatment program shall be available to the EPA on an immediate and unlimited basis.

ARTICLE VII. - WATER CONTAMINATION PREVENTION[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3380, §§ 1-11, adopted June 25, 1990, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore, inclusion as §§ 26-181-26-191 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Cross reference- Plumbing code, § 6-161 et seq. 

Sec. 26-181. - Cross-connection control-General policy. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article to: 
(1)  Protect the public potable water supply from contamination by isolating or containing within the consumer's internal distribution system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public potable water supply system. 
(2)  Promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial-process systems. 
(3)  Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
(b)  Application. This article shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water system of the City of Lebanon, Missouri, existing as of June 1, 1990. As to all modifications to any existing consumer system and all new consumer systems introduced after June 1, 1990, and as to all backflow incidents occurring after June 1, 1990, to any system existing or future, the provisions of the Code of State Regulations of Missouri Section 60-11.010 relating to prevention of backflow as promulgated by the Department of Natural Resources together with all amendments thereto, shall apply, and such regulation is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. Section 26-189(d) of this article regarding inspections, section 26-190 of this article regarding violations, and section 26-191 of this article regarding penalties shall apply uniformly to all existing and future systems and all backflow incidents. 
(c)  Policy. This article will be reasonably interpreted by the City of Lebanon. It is the water purveyor's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
    It is the policy of the city that the consumer is responsible for protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement and maintain the program to control cross connections. 
    If, in the judgment of the city or its authorized representative, cross-connection protection is required through either piping modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall comply by providing the required protection at his own expense; and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.

SECTION 1. - TITLE, INTENT AND PURPOSE 

A. - Title. 
    These regulations may be referred to as the "ZONING ORDINANCE" of the City of Lebanon, Missouri. 
B. - Intent and Purpose. 
(1)  These regulations have been based upon the comprehensive plan for the City of Lebanon, Missouri. Said comprehensive plan included estimates of population growth, land use surveys, a land use plan, plans for major thoroughfares, other transportation facilities, community facilities, public services and utilities, and a public works program. 
(2)  Need for public services and facilities in both size and location depends upon the character and intensity of land use. Regulation of the use of land is thus fundamental to a coordinated optimum physical development of the community. The land use regulations are intended to be the foundation of the entire process of improvement of the physical environment. 
(3)  The regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing property uses and values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses. 
(4)  The land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning districts. 
(a)  The comprehensive plan included careful estimates of the land area requirements for the various land uses such as commerce, residence, industry, transportation, and public uses. These urban uses should be directed into that land area where they may be most efficiently served by public services and facilities such as sewers, water, schools, parks and the like. Remaining lands should be reserved for rural uses. Consequently, the regulations include a Rural District for non-urban land uses. 
(b)  In the past, residential neighborhoods have deteriorated because they were invaded by small isolated commercial uses and by more intensive residential uses such as duplexes or apartment buildings. The great majority of our population desire to, and do, live in single-family homes which they own and which are located on fairly large lots. The regulations establish residential districts particularly designed to provide maximum protection for single-family homes. 
(c)  Two-family and multiple-family uses are permitted as conditional uses in residential and commercial districts. Density, yard, and parking regulations would insure good living conditions in these areas. Much of present day building is by large projects instead of lot by lot. The regulations provide for planned unit developments which may be located in any district with approval of the site plan. This introduces an important measure of flexibility into the regulations. 
(d)  Commercial districts recognize the different types of commercial areas that will be needed by the future growth of the community. There is a central commercial district for the downtown area and a district for commercial areas along major streets and highways. 
(e)  For industry there are two districts-a "light" industrial district for nonobnoxious manufacturing and a "general" or unrestricted industrial district. 
(f)  The regulations are reasonable in relation to existing conditions. Yard dimensions are adjusted to peculiarities of existing lots. Lots that are now too small may be used. Nonconforming uses are permitted to continue for adequate time periods. 
(g)  All uses are required to provide their own off-street parking (with a few exceptions). Over a period of years, enforcement of this requirement will enable streets to be used primarily for traffic movement. 
(h)  Each of the regulations has been designed to work harmoniously with the others with the totality providing that minimum degree of land use control essential to the realization of the optimum urban environment.

(1)  Planned Unit Development 
    Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development is to allow: 
(a)  Greater flexibility than is permitted by standard district regulations for tracts and lands where the planned development would better utilize the topographic and natural character of the site and would produce a more economic and stable development; 
(b)  Permanent preservation of common open space and provision of recreational facilities; 
(c)  A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better development and design and the construction of aesthetic amenities; 
(d)  Developments which will have a more beneficial effect upon the health, safety, general welfare, and stability of the City than development under strict conformity with district regulations; and 
(e)  Innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development so that growing demands of population may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings. 
    Procedure: 
(a)  Pre-Petition Meeting-Prior to official submittal of an application for consideration of a Planned Unit Development, the petitioner shall submit a letter of intent to the Commission. Such letter shall be submitted to the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall forward copies of such letter of intent to the Commission and the letter shall be included in the agenda of the next meeting of the Commission. The Commission shall select a date and, upon the selection of such date, the petitioner shall meet with the Commission and discuss the scope and nature of the proposed development, and the design requirements of the Commission concerning this proposal. Any pre-petition meeting of the Commission may be a part of the regularly scheduled meeting, shall be open to the public, and shall be included in the agenda in advance of said meeting. A pre-application meeting is required; however, it is not binding, and it does not require formal application, fee, or filing of a Planned Unit Development plat. A pre-petition conference may be repeated by mutual agreement. 
(b)  Application-Following the pre-petition meeting with the Plan[ing] Commission, application may be made, which application shall be in accordance with procedures set forth in the following paragraphs: 
An application and development plan for a Planned Unit Development shall be filed with the Building and Zoning Administrator and thereafter entered into the records of the first meeting of the Council. 
A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the Building and Zoning Administrator to the Commission with a request to hold a public hearing and submit to the Council a report of its findings and recommendations. The Commission shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days, for the hearing of the request for Planned Unit Development and give due notice in the same manner as provided in this article. 
Such public hearings shall be held upon such notice, and findings and recommendations of the Commission shall be submitted to the Council not later than 60 days following the conclusion of the public hearing. 
The Council, upon report of the Commission and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed Planned Unit Development or may refer it back to the Commission for further consideration. The approval by the Council shall not be effective unless the petitioner complies with requirements of this ordinance. 
In case a written protest against any proposed Planned Unit Development signed and acknowledged by owners of 20 percent of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of 20 percent of the frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley therefrom, or by owners of 20 percent of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be altered, is filed with the City Clerk, the approval of the Planned Unit Development cannot be passed except on the favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all members of the Council. 
Any variation granted in the course of processing Planned Unit Development shall be considered a part of the Commission's duties and a hearing by the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not be required; instead, the Commission, after its public hearing, shall recommend all variations so desired, as part of the overall recommendation on the project. 
(Ord. No. 3253, § 6, 6-22-87) 
(c)  Approval by City-When a Planned Unit Development is approved by the Council, the developer shall guarantee the implementation of the conditions established as part of the development plan in a manner satisfactory to the Council. The plan, as authorized by the Council, shall not be modified unless the modification is processed as a new application under these provisions, except that a pre-petition meeting is not required, and except changes of use to other uses permitted in the district in which the planned development is located are permitted provided Commission's recommendations and the Council's approval for such change is obtained. Failure to comply with the conditions and regulations as herein established and as specifically made applicable to a specific project development shall be cause for termination of the approval for said project. At least 15 days' notice shall be given to the developer to appear before the Plan Commission and answer any such charge of non-compliance. 
The Commission shall report its findings and recommendations to the Council. The Council may terminate the project's approval if the non-compliance is not satisfactorily adjusted within a specified period. 
(d)  Zoning Map-An approved Planned Unit Development shall be delineated and designated by number on the zoning map. A file, available for inspection by the public, shall be maintained by the Building and Zoning Administrator for each planned development so designated. The file shall contain a record of the approved development plan and all use exceptions allowed. 
(Ord. No. 3253, § 6, 6-22-87) 
(e)  The approval of the project shall be automatically terminated and the previous zoning shall apply if construction, in accordance with the project plan, is not completed within four years of the time of its approval as herein provided. 
    General Standards: 
(a)  Minimum Size-A Planned Unit Development shall be under single ownership and/or unified control. 
A Planned Unit Development shall not be less than 10 acres for residential, two acres for commercial, and six acres for industrial in gross land area, and the average width of the site shall not be less than 150 feet. Any part of the land required for dedication for street rights-of-way in the process of the Planned Unit Development shall be considered as part of the above stated Gross Land Acreage.

Eight sets of development plans shall be submitted with the application. The development plan shall include, as a minimum, the following materials, except for any items waived by the Commission at the Pre-Petition meeting: 
an accurate topographic and boundary line map of the project area and a location map showing its relationship to surrounding properties;

the maintenance of common open space and provisions related to the future use of private property (additions, expansions, changes in use, etc.) shall also be included. 
(e)  Underground Utilities-All planned developments shall provide for underground installation of utilities. 
    Residential Planned Developments: 
(a)  Permitted Uses-Uses in a planned residential development must conform to that in the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  Lot Size-No minimum lot area is required for individual buildings, except that individual lots for single-family detached dwellings which may be provided within the overall planned development shall not be less than 5,000 square feet in area. 
(c)  Gross Density: 
In the RU-1 District-not more than 0.8 dwellings per acre. 
In the RU-2 District-no dwellings permitted. 
In the RS-1 District-not more than 3.3 dwellings per acre. 
In the RS-2 District-not more than 6.7 dwellings per acre. 
(d)  Gross Density Incentives-The maximum gross densities for residential planned developments specified above, may be increased if recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council, but not greater than 50 percent above the gross density otherwise permitted in the district, said 50 percent in accordance with the following standards: 
in no case shall the gross density premium increase the density in any district in excess of 10 dwelling units per gross acre. 
for planned developments which abut a public park which is 10 acres or more in area-not more than 10 percent. 
for the dedication of public recreational and educational sites recommended in the Comprehensive Plan-equal to the number of dwelling units that would otherwise have been permitted upon the lands so dedicated. 
for the provision of unique design features such as golf courses and lakes, swimming pools, underground parking and other similar features within the planned development which require unusually high development costs and which achieve an especially attractive and stable development-as determined by the Commission. 
when a Planned Unit Development provides for greater number of dwelling units per acre than would be permitted by the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the site, the developer has the burden to show that such increase will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighborhood property. The Commission in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public services to be achieved by: (1) the amount, location and proposed use of common open space; and (2) the location, design and type of dwelling units. The Commission may, in its determination, also consider that the physical characteristics of the site may make increased densities appropriate in the particular location. 
(e)  Lot Width-The requirements of the prevailing district may be waived. 
(f)  Yards-The requirements of the prevailing districts are applicable to exterior boundaries of the planned development only. 
(g)  Distance Between Buildings-In the parts of Planned Unit Development containing dwelling types other than single-family detached dwellings, the spacing between buildings shall not be less than that set forth in the respective underlying district.

(i)  Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading-In accordance with the regulations set forth in Section 8 of this ordinance. 
Commercial Planned Development -A Commercial Planned Development may be proposed for a single zoning lot or lots located with any business district in order to promote the cooperative development of shopping centers and integral parking facilities and common access points into thoroughfares, to limit the ingress and egress points and to reduce congestion on the thoroughfares to separate pedestrian and automobile traffic, to develop shopping centers of size and location compatible with market potential and adjoining land use, and to encourage harmonious architecture between adjacent commercial structures. 
(a)  Permitted Uses-Uses permitted in a Commercial Planned Development may include uses other than those permitted in the underlying district in which said development is located, provided the inclusion of such uses are recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council. The Commission is recommending the inclusion of such uses other than those permitted by the underlying district, shall find that the uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development. 
(b)  Activities Shall be Enclosed-Retail sales and services, including storage of materials, shall be conducted or stored entirely within a wholly and permanently enclosed building or buildings which shall be of an architectural design compatible with surrounding uses and structures, unless otherwise recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council. 
(c)  Lot Size-No minimum lot area is required for individual buildings; however, the gross land area within the Commercial Planned Development shall be not less than the minimum area specified above. 
(d)  Building Coverage-Building and structures shall not cover more than 30 percent of the lot area. 
(e)  Usable Open Space-At least 10 percent of the total lot area of the Commercial Planned Development shall be provided for landscaped and usable open space purposes.

(g)  Off-Street Parking Facilities-Off-street parking facilities for Commercial Planned Developments shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 8 of this ordinance. 
(h)  Off-Street Loading Facilities-Off-street loading facilities shall be provided for each use as required by Section 8 of this ordinance; however, the architectural design of the project shall provide for common access routes and loading areas, so the loading and unloading operation can be conducted efficiently, and be sufficiently curtailed from the view of the neighboring properties. 
(i)  Design Standards: 
Where a Commercial Planned Development adjoins the boundaries of residential, public open space, schools, churches or other similar uses, the development shall be adequately screened by fencing or landscaping or both. 
Ingress and egress shall be designed so as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
Outside lighting shall be designed so as not to be disturbing to adjacent residential areas. 
Manufacturing Planned Developments. For planned developments located in the M-1 and M-2 Manufacturing Districts, exceptions may be made in the use and bulk regulations of the district as follows: 
(a)  Permitted Uses: 
Uses specified as permitted uses in the underlying zoning district. 
Uses specified as special uses in the underlying zoning district when approved as a part of the development plan. 
In Manufacturing Planned Developments occupying over 50 acres of land, and having not less than 800 feet of frontage on a major street, uses permitted in the commercial districts may be permitted, provided that the area devoted to such uses and their accessory uses such as off-street parking shall not exceed 50 percent of the total area of the Manufacturing Planned Development.

(7)  Additional Use Regulations: Whenever there is an intended use which does not exactly fit into an existing permissive or conditional use category, under this district, the intended use shall be classified under the use category to which it is most similar in nature. In such case, the Zoning and Planning Commission shall have the authority to further condition the operation of the intended use such that there can be no changes or alterations in the intended use. 
(8)  Nonconforming Uses are Regulated: 
(a)  Nonconforming Use of Land. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, Districts where open land is being used as a nonconforming use, and such use is the principal use and not accessory to the main use conducted in a building, such use shall be allowed to continue in its then existing form, provided that it otherwise conforms to all other provisions of these Zoning Regulations, provided that it is not a nuisance as provided in the city ordinance applicable to nuisances and provided that it conforms to all other ordinances, regulations and laws applicable thereto. 
(b)  Nonconforming Use of Buildings. Except as otherwise provided herein, the lawful use of a building, mobile home, or modular home existing at the effective date of this ordinance [April 23, 1984] may be continued although such use does not conform to the provision hereof. A nonconforming use of a building, mobile home, or modular home may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.

SECTION 1.0 - PURPOSE 

A. - Title and List of Guidelines. 
    These regulations may be referred as the "Access Management Ordinance" of the City of Lebanon. 
LIST OF GUIDELINES 
    The following table provides a listing and rationale for the guidelines included in this document. 
Access Management Guidelines What It Means Why It Is Important Distance between major at-grade intersections. The minimum distance or spacing between types of roadways (e.g. between two major streets. Preserves traffic flow and ensures that a functional hierarchy of roads in maintained: Distance between traffic signals. The minimum and desirable spacing between signals. Ensures efficient traffic flow on signalized arterials. Too many signals placed too close together will disrupt traffic flow. Auxiliary lanes (dedicated left and right turning lane guidelines. The traffic conditions under which turning lanes should be provided to serve a commercial or industrial driveway or street. Some high volume driveways should have dedicated left or right turn lanes to reduce conflicts with through traffic. Guideline on using two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL). When TWLTL's should be used and when raised medians should be used instead. TWLTL's are far less controversial than raised medians; however TWLTL's do not function well once a certain traffic volume range has been reached. Guidelines for using three lane TWLTL crossing-section. The three land road may perform better than a four lane undivided roadway under the right circumstances. Three lane roads are a relatively new concept that may be an economical solution to some access problems. Driveway spacing and density. The amount of distance between driveways and the number of driveways per unit of frontage. These guidelines should vary with the roadway classification, the expected land use, and the speed limit for the road. Short spacing between driveways and high driveway densities generate conflict points that in turn lead to higher crash rates and more traffic congestion. Corner clearance and clearance of the functional areas of intersections. The minimum distance allowed between an intersection and the first driveway. Insufficient corner clearance is a major cause of access-related crashes. Sight distance standards. The sight distance conditions under which a driveway should not be allowed. A driveway opening where there is insufficient sight distance is inherently dangerous. Driveway geometric guidelines. The width, turning radius, throat length, approach angle, grade and surfacing requirements for driveways. These can very by the expected land use served by the driveway and the roadway classifications Insufficient driveway geometrics lead to slow driveway entrance and exit speeds. This leads to conflicts between turning and through traffic. Driveway geometric design can help or hinder pedestrians and bicyclists. Parking on Streets. Vehicle parking on street right-of-way. Street parking increases congestion and crashes on city streets as drivers pull on and off the roadway often with limited visibility.  
B. - Purpose and Policy. 
    To define policy and procedure to improve traffic flow and safety on existing city streets. 
    As development occurs and vehicle traffic increases, many roadways deteriorate into highly congested routes that experience unacceptable delays and crashes. This deterioration can be due in part to improperly spaced and designed intersections and driveways. These intersections and driveways cause crashes and conflicts to through traffic. Roadways serve a dual purpose of providing a means of transport between one place and another and providing access to adjacent property. Access management is intended to balance the roadways' role of serving through traffic with the role of providing access to property. 
    Once the safety and efficient operation of a roadway is lost, it is difficult and expensive to restore. Adding lanes to an existing route does not completely solve the problem. 
    The goals established for the development of access management guidelines for the City of Lebanon include the following: 
  Improve roadway safety 
  Improve traffic operations 
  Protect taxpayers' investment in roadways 
  Co-ordinate all City Planning efforts to maximize resource utilization. 
    Access management involves the proper planning and design of points of access to the public roadway system. These points of access include public roadway intersections and driveways. Sound access management can have a positive impact on roadway safety and the ability of roadways to carry traffic efficiently and safely. Failure to properly manage access can result in safety and operational problems, negatively impact adjacent property owners, and cause a loss of the public's investment in the roadway system. 
    Access management on existing streets with existing driveways will only be considered at the time of a major change to traffic flows or street configuration. 
    New roadways intersecting existing roadways will be subject to these guidelines after adoption by the City Council. 
    All new driveways, intersections or access to City streets must be approved by the City of Lebanon Planning and Zoning Administrator and shall be granted an access permit. 
    Driveway and intersection guidelines include the following: 
  Spacing for public road intersections 
  Spacing of traffic signals 
  Driveway spacing and density 
  Corner clearance and clearance of functional areas of public road intersections 
  Sight distance minimums 
  Driveway geometric design 
  Angle of intersection and approach radii 
  Driveway width, throat length and grade 
  Guidelines for surfacing and curbs 
SECTION 2.0 - STREET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND ACCESS PERMITS 

A. - Street Classification Map. 
1.  The City Council shall adopt a street classification map consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and according to the classifications as set out below. This map shall be amended from time to time and shall be used to guide the decision-making process regarding access to public street system. 
a.  Principal Arterial. A street primarily intended to provide for high-volume, moderate-speed traffic and moderate to extended trip length traffic movement between major activity centers. Access to abutting property to major traffic movement and is subject to the necessary control of entrances and exits. (E.g. Elm, Hwy 5, Hwy 32, Morgan, etc.) 
b.  Major Arterial. A street which interconnects with and augments and feeds the primary arterial system and is intended for moderate volume, moderate speed traffic and short to moderate trip lengths. Access to abutting property is partially controlled. (E.g. Beck, Tower, etc.) 
c.  Major Collector. A street which collects and distributes traffic to and from local and arterial street systems and is primarily intended to provide for low-to-moderate volume, low-speed and short length trips while also providing access to abutting property. (E.g. Adams, Clark, Madison) 
d.  Residential Collector. A street which collects and distributes residential traffic between local streets and collector and arterial streets and is primarily intended for low-to-moderate volume, low-speed and short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties. (E.g. Fowler, Deadra, Raef, Brook, etc.) 
B. - Residential/Commercial Subdivisions Access Permits. 
1.  Plat approved permits. Approval process through plat and access permit numbers assigned with building permit. 
2.  New construction initiated accesses not approved via sub division plat (i.e. new construction initiated after November 1, 2007). The turnaround guildlines for approval is 5 days once application has been submitted. 
SECTION 3.0 - AT-GRADE INTERSECTIONS SPACING 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    The guideline governs the minimum distance or spacing between types of public roadways and their intersections. This guideline provides for a hierarchy of roads and maintains adequate spacing between roads that are intended to serve through traffic. Collectors provide some service to through traffic but also provide direct access to property; therefore, they can be placed closer together. 
B. - Minimum Guideline. 
Roadway Classification Minimum Spacing Principal Arterial 1 mile (5,280 feet) Major Arterial 1/2 mile (2,640 feet) Collector 1/4 mile (1,320 feet) Residential Collector 1/4 mile min. to 1/2 mile max.  
SECTION 4.0 - TRAFFIC SIGNALS SPACING 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    This guideline governs the distance between signalized at-grade intersections on public roadways. Minimum spacing is mainly intended to preserve efficient traffic flow and progression on urban arterial roadways; for instance, a quarter-or half-mile spacing allows traffic signals to be effectively interconnected and synchronized. Adequate spacing will also tend to reduce rear-end collisions and "stop and go" driving that increases congestion, delay, ad air pollution. In urban areas, these guidelines were developed to allow for smooth operations given a 90-second total traffic signal cycle length. 
B. - Minimum Guideline. 
Roadway Classification In Current and Projected Urban Areas Principal Arterial *1/2 mile (2,640 feet)  
*Only advisable when traffic count warrants or special circumstances exist. 
SECTION 5.0 - AUXILIARY TURNING LANES 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    Dedicated left and right-turn lanes should be provided in situations where traffic volumes and speeds are relatively high and conflicts are likely to develop at public road intersections and private driveways between through and turning traffic. Auxiliary lanes are an asset in promoting safety and improved traffic flow in such situations. The use and design of any auxiliary lanes shall always be guided by a traffic study. Some major applications for and considerations for the design of auxiliary lanes are as follows: 
B. - Installing Auxiliary Left-Turn Lanes. 
    Such lanes, installed in the roadway center, are intended to remove turning vehicles from the through traffic flow. This should reduce the frequency of rear-end collisions at locations where there is considerable left-turn ingress activity, such as major driveways and minor public road intersections. Suggested application for left-turn lanes in the median are shown in the table below. A turn lane shall be considered when the left-turning volume meets or exceeds the value in the table for a posted speed. 
Posted Speed Limit (mph) Left-turn Volume (at Peak Hour) 35 20 45 15  
    The use and design of auxiliary left-turn lanes shall be guided by a traffic study. In general, auxiliary left-turn lanes must be long enough to accommodate a safe deceleration distance and to provide adequate storage of a queue for expected peak hour turning traffic. 
C. - Installing Auxiliary Right-Turn Lanes. 
    The use of dedicated right-turn lanes shall also always be guided by a traffic study. In general, dedicated right-turn lanes shall be provided on two lane routes as shown in the table below when the right-turn volumes at peak hour are met or exceeded. 
Posted Speed Limit (mph) Right-turn Volume (at Peak Hour) 35 20 45 15  
D. - Dedicated right turn lanes shall be considered in situations where: 
  Poor internal site design and circulation leads to backups on the mainline. Auto-oriented businesses with short drive-through lanes or poorly-designed parking lots would be prime examples of this situation. 
  The peak hour turning traffic activity is unusually high (e.g. greater than 10 percent of the daily total.) 
  The driveway or minor public road intersection is difficult for drivers to see. 
  The driveway entrance is gated or otherwise must be entered very slowly. 
  Right turning traffic consists of an unusually high number of trailers or other large vehicles. 
  The intersection or driveway angle is highly skewed. 
  Rear end collision experience is unusually high at a location. 


    As with any auxiliary turning lane, dedicated right-turn lanes shall be designed based on the results of a traffic study. 
E. - Width of Auxiliary Acceleration and Turn Lanes. 
    Any auxiliary turning lanes such as dedicated right and left turns, shall be at least 11 feet wide. Twelve feet is a desirable width, not including the gutter. 
SECTION 6.0 - THREE-LANE CROSS SECTIONS 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    Three-lane cross sections (two through lanes with a TWLTL in the center) are a possible access management tool in certain situations. Such roadways are about 25 percent safer than an undivided four-lane road and can provide comparable capacity provided that intersections are well designed. They work best in situations where traffic volumes are moderate and where the proportion of vehicles turning left is high. TWLTL's are best used in situations where driveway density is low to moderate (e.g., below 24 commercial driveways per mile, which equates to a spacing of about 440 feet between driveways). They shall be strongly considered in multifamily residential areas or mixed land use areas, especially on minor arterials and collectors. This guideline does not refer to third lanes used as passing, turning, or climbing lanes in rural areas. 

B. - Guidelines. 
Roadway Classification In Current and Projected Urban Areas Principal Arterial Not Available Major Arterial May be used when appropriate and/or where AADT in design year is less than 15,000 Collector May be used when appropriate and/or where AADT in design year is less than 15,000 Residential Collector Not Available  
SECTION 7.0 - DRIVEWAY SPACING 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    This guideline governs the minimum recommended spacing between private driveways necessary to preserve both safety and traffic flow. Spacing between driveways must be longer on higher speed routes in rural areas than in urban areas. In urban areas, these guidelines allow for about one driveway per city block face on principal arterials, minor arterials, and two driveways per block face on collectors. 
    In order to preserve spacing, direct access should be moved to local streets (not arterials) or shared driveways where possible. In particular, access for corner lots should be moved to a lower traffic side street whenever possible. Access can often be better accomplished on major streets through such means as frontage and backage roads, joint access, cross access, and shared driveways. This guideline only applies where sight distance allows. Driveways shall not be allowed where sight distance is inadequate even if the driveway spacing guideline would allow them. 
    Driveway accesses shall be provided on local and collector streets ("side streets") rather than arterials wherever possible. Driveways shall also be lined up across the public roadway from each other whenever possible. When driveways are not lined up, the minimum spacing shall be measured from the closest driveway on either side of the road, except where a non-traversable (e.g., raised) median exists. 
    On urban routes where non-traversable medians exist, shorter driveway spacing may be acceptable for right-in, right-out driveways only. 

B. - Minimum Guideline. 
Roadway Classification Driveway Spacing Principal Arterial 440 ft. Major Arterial 220 ft. Collectors 220 ft. (desirable) Residential Collector N/A  
SECTION 8.0 - DRIVEWAY CORNER CLEARANCE 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    Corner clearance represents the distance between the corner of the intersection of two public roadways and the next private driveway. It is important to provide enough distance between the comer and the first driveway to effectively separate conflict points and to allow drivers enough time to make safe maneuvers. When corners are not adequately cleared, high crash rates tend to occur. Delays and traffic congestion also result when corners are not adequately cleared. These guidelines correspond to the minimum driveway spacing guidelines for the same roadway classification. This guideline only applies where the minimum sight distance guideline allows. 

B. - Minimum Guideline. 
Roadway Classification Corner Clearance Principal Arterial 220 feet Major Arterial 220 feet Collector 100 feet (desirable) Residential Collector 100 feet (desirable) or as far as practically possible  
SECTION 9.0 - DRIVEWAY SIGHT DISTANCE 

A. - What This Standard Means. 
    Sight distance for driveway construction shall be considered essential in the design and issuance of permits for all classes of driveways. If there is a request to construct a driveway at a questionable location, a traffic study must include an on-site inspection to evaluate the sight distance. Sight distance is always the most important consideration in allowing, not allowing, or placing driveways. 
    There are two basic concerns of responsibility when considering the sight distance requirements for any driveway. The first concern is to provide maximum safety for the motoring public. The second concern is to provide for access to the adjacent property owners. Both vertical and horizontal alignment can limit sight distance. 
1.  How to Measure Vertical Sight Distance. To measure actual sight distance limited by vertical alignment in the field, place a sighting target 4.25 feet above and 20 feet from the edge of pavement at the proposed driveway location (approximate location of a driver approaching the roadway). On minor arterial and collector routes, the target may be placed at a point 14.4 feet from edge of pavement. Sighting from a height of 3.5 feet, move along the roadway away from the proposed driveway site to a point just beyond where the target disappears. Then move back toward the target until it can first be seen. Place a mark on the pavement and then measure the distance along the roadway between the mark and the target. This measured distance is the vertical sight distance. Measurement may also be made with an accurate measuring device mounted on an automobile. 
2.  How to Measure Horizontal Sight Distance. To measure horizontal sight distance, place a sighting target 4.25 feet above and 20 feet from the edge of pavement at the proposed driveway location. On minor arterial and collector routes, the target may be placed at a point 14.4 feet from edge of pavement. Move away from the target along the roadway until the target is just out of sight or the line of sight is beyond the right-of-way limits. The line of sight must stay within the limits of the right-of-way. Consideration should also be given to vegetation both on the right-of-way and adjacent to the right-of-way as it may impede vision more during certain times of the year. Sighting from a height of 3.5 feet, move along the roadway toward the target until it can first be seen and place a mark on the pavement. Measure the distance between the mark and the target along the roadway. This measured distance is the sight distance. 
The three sight distance categories are; design sight distance, minimum sight distance and minimum stopping sight distance. 
TABLE 9.1 
Design Sight Distance (Feet) SPEED* 30 35 40 45 50 55 DISTANCE 370 470 570 700 830 980  
*Speed is the greater of the following; the design speed of the roadway or the posted speed. In cases where the design speed is unknown, posted speed will apply. 
Basis: Based on Figure IX - 41 (situations B-2b and Cob) of the AASHTO Green Book, 1990 edition, and Table 14 of NCHRP Report 383. 
B. - Application. 
    Preparation for issuing a driveway permit must include a prior inspection of the driveway site to ensure that vehicles can enter and exit from the proposed driveway with a minimum disruption of traffic along the roadway. Sight distance should be considered the essential element in the location of all driveways with particular emphasis placed upon public street approaches, high-volume commercial and industrial driveways, and all driveways on principal arterial routes. Field measurements shall be based on a 3.5 feet height of eye and a 4.25 feet height of abject. The sight distance for the proposed driveway is measured for each direction of travel and the smaller distance is then located in the sight distance chart for the speed* of the roadway to determine which sight distance criterion is met, if any. 
1.  Design Sight Distance. If the driveway location meets or exceeds the requirements for the design sight distance for the speed* of the roadway as established by Table 9.1, a permit may be written, providing the other appropriate requirements are met. 
TABLE 9.2 
Minimum Sight Distance (Feet) SPEED* 30 35 40 45 50 55 DISTANCE 310 360 410 460 510 560  
*Speed is the greater of the following; the design speed of the roadway or the posted speed. In cases where the design speed is unknown, posted speed will apply. 
Basis: Based on Figure IX - 41 (situations B-1) of the AASHTO Green Book, 1990 edition, and Table 14 of NCHRP Report 383. 
2.  Minimum Sight Distance. If no location on the applicant's frontage meets or exceeds design sight distance but a location does meet or exceed the distances shown in Table 9.2, a permit may be issued in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed driveway location has the maximum sight distance available on the entire property frontage. 
2.  The access management classification category for the route is minor arterial or collector. 
3.  The proposed location is not for a public street approach or a high-volume commercial driveway. 
4.  The following applicant's responsibility clause is added to the permit: "Applicant understands the presence of this driveway creates a potential sight distance problem and has been so informed in writing by the department." 
In this instance, it is imperative that property owners be on the site to be certain they understand the conditions of this driveway construction. 
TABLE 9.3 
Minimum Stopping Sight Distance (feet) SPEED * 30 35 40 45 50 55 DISTANCE 200 225 275 325 400 450  
*Speed is the greater of the following; the design speed of the roadway or the posted speed. In cases where the design speed is unknown, posted speed will apply. 
Basis: Based on Table III-1 of the AASHTO Green Book, 1990 edition, and Table 14 of NCHRP Report 383. 
3.  Minimum Stop Distance. If no location on the applicant's frontage meets or exceeds minimum sight distance but a location does meet or exceed the distances shown in Table 9.3, a permit may be issued in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed driveway location has the maximum sight distance available on the entire property frontage. 
2.  The access management classification category for the route is minor arterial or collector. 
3.  The proposed location is not for a public street approach or a high-volume commercial driveway. 
4.  There is no other available access having equal or greater sight distance. 
5.  The applicant's responsibility clause is added to the permit: "Applicant understands the presence of this driveway creates a potential sight distance problem and has been so informed in writing by the City of Lebanon." 
6.  The following clause is added to the permit in addition to the applicant's responsibility clause: "Applicant is aware that the sight distance of this driveway is severely restricted. The sight distance is the minimum necessary for a vehicle traveling at the posted speed to come to a complete stop prior to the driveway." 
If these conditions are not met the permit shall not be issued for the driveway. If an appeal for the access is made, it should be sent to the City Engineer for additional review. 
The applicant should be advised of work that could improve sight distance for the location, such as minor grading or brush removal. 
The City may allow the widening of a driveway with limited sight distance or may allow the relocation of a driveway with limited sight distance to a location on the property frontage with better sight distance. This will be allowed on routes with normal right-of-way, provided there is no change in driveway usage. The following responsibility clause must be added to the permit: 
Applicant understands that the existing sight distance for this driveway is less than current design standards and the driveway modification, while beneficial to the property owner, will not remedy the sight distance limitation. 
C. - Adjustment for Steep Grades. 
    The sight distance standards here assume a level (flat) roadway. On many roadways in Missouri, there are significant upgrades or downgrades along the road profile. The AASHTO Green Book indicates that for upgrades or downgrades of up to and including three percent, there is little effect of grade on stopping site distance. However, when an upgrade equals or exceeds four percent, stopping sight distances need to be adjusted to account for the fact that vehicles entering the traffic stream will take longer to accelerate to the posted speed limit. The impact of grade will be most profound for combination trucks (e.g., the AASHTO WB-50 design vehicle) and other heavy vehicles. 
    When there is a significant upgrade (e.g., over 4 percent) that must be negotiated by an entering vehicle, the adjustment factors in Table 9.4 should be applied to the stopping sight distance tables noted above by multiplying the adjustment factor to the appropriate stopping sight distance figure. When a driveway is used significant number of combination vehicles, the higher of the two adjustment factors should be used. 
TABLE 9.4 
ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR STEEP GRADES 
Typical Entering Vehicle Flat to 4% Grade Grades Between 4% to 6% Grades 6% or More Passenger Vehicles (P) and Single-Unit Trucks (SU) No adjustment needed 1.3 1.5 Combination Trucks (WB-50) No adjustment needed 1.7 2.2  
Basis: Adapted from the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. 
If at all possible, public road intersections or high-volume private driveways should not be placed along roadway segments where the grade of the roadway exceeds six percent. 
SECTION 10.0 - DRIVEWAY GEOMETRICS ON CLASSIFIED STREETS 
    The design of driveways is critical in access management in that it affects the speed of traffic turning into and out of driveways. This in turn affects the speed differential between through traffic and turning traffic. Large speed differentials are created when driveways are inadequately designed. Large speed differentials are associated with higher crash rates and diminished traffic operations. 
    Driveway designs should always be based on the results of a study of the traffic likely to use them; these guidelines are presented to illustrate good practices for driveway designs. 

A. - Lining Up Driveways Across Roadways. 
    Driveways should be as closely lined up with driveways across roadways without non-traversable medians to the maximum extent possible even if less spacing between driveways is the result. 
B. - Angle of Intersection to the Public Roadway. 
1.  Driveways that serve two-way traffic should have angles of intersection with the public road of 90 degrees or very near 90 degrees. The minimum acceptable angle for driveways that serve two-way traffic is 70 degrees. 
2.  Driveways that serve one-way traffic may have an acute angular placement of from 60 to 90 degrees. 
C. - Right-Turn (Approach) Radius. 
    Approach radii shall be large enough to allow entering vehicles to do so at a reasonable rate of speed. The following are suggested as minimum approach radii and are measured from the edge of the driving surface of the roadway. Any maximum approach radius is allowable for driveways. 
Driveways Types Minimum Right Turn Radius Principal & Major 20 feet Commercial Driveways 20 feet Collector 15 feet  
    Inside radii should be determined on a case by case basis given driveway angle, traffic volume, and other relevant factors. Sites that generate substantial large truck traffic need inside larger radii to accommodate the wheel path of the turning trucks. 
D. - Driveway Width. 
    No driveways shall have widths less than 12 feet. Driveways of greater than 54 feet should be strongly discouraged unless they contain a raised median to separate traffic lanes. Driveways that serve one-way traffic shall be from 20 to 30 feet wide. Driveway widths shall be measured from the face of curb to the face of curb at the point of tangency. Any medians contained in the driveway are above and beyond the minimum widths in the table. Minimum acceptable and maximum acceptable widths for various levels of traffic and directions of access are shown in the table below: 
Driveway Traffic Category Average Daily Traffic Using Driveway Average Daily Traffic Using Driveway With Two-Way Access With One-Way Access Minimum Width Maximum Width Minimum Width Maximum Width Residential 0-100 0-10 12 feet N/A N/A N/A Low Volume Commercial/industrial <1500 <150 28 feet** 42 feet*** 20 feet* 20 feet* Medium Volume Commercial/industrial <1500-4000 150-400 40 feet*** 54 feet**** 20 feet* 30 feet** High Volume Commercial/industrial >4000 >400 40 feet*** To be determined through a traffic study Generally not applicable Generally not applicable  
*One-lane driveways. 
**Driveway striped for two lanes. 
***Driveway striped for three lanes. 
****Driveway striped for four lanes. 
    All commercial and industrial driveways should be curbed on approach. 
E. - Driveways and Accommodation of Pedestrians. 
    Where driveways cross pedestrian sidewalks all Americans with Disabilities Act regulations shall be followed. 
F. - Vertical Geometrics-Driveway Grade Change (Commercial Driveways Only). 
    Access driveways on arterial roadways shall always be designed to allow vehicles to proceed into or out of the driveway at a speed that will prevent large speed differentials between turning and through traffic. Required apron lengths, desirable grade changes and maximum allowable grade changes are shown in the table below. The apron is a relatively flat area where the driveway meets the public roadway. These guidelines apply to all types of driveways, including for residential, commercial and industrial uses. Driveways shall always have a minimum grade change between 1/2 to 1 percent to provide for adequate drainage. Either an upgrade or downgrade is permissible. 
    Desirable grades and maximum allowable grades are shown in the following table. Driveways should have a minimum grade of 1% for drainage. 
Roadway Classification Required Minimum Apron Length ("A" in the Diagram) Desirable Grade Change Maximum Grade Change Allowed Principal Arterial 25-30 feet [2%-3%] [3%-4%] Minor Arterial 20 feet [4%] [5%] Collector 15 feet I [5%] [6%]  
Notes: NA: No driveways are allowed on this classification. The Apron Length is shown as "A" and grade change as "D" on the diagram below. The grade may change along the course of the driveway, as indicated by G1 and G2. In such cases, it is very important to ensure that the minimum apron length is maintained. 

SECTION 11.0 - PARKING ON STREETS 

A. - What This Guideline Means. 
    This guideline suggests when parking may be allowed on facilities. In general, parking shall not be allowed on street facilities that are primarily intended to serve through traffic movement. On facilities such as collectors, parking may be allowed if an engineering study indicates that it is safe to do so and that the parking will not unduly hinder traffic operations. 
    Only parallel parking shall be allowed. No angle parking shall be permitted on any of the types of facilities listed in the table below. Angle parking may, however, be appropriate if the goal is to provide something other than smooth traffic flow or safety. 
B. - Recommended Guideline. 
Roadway Classification Parking Guidelines Principal Arterial No parking Major Arterial Parking should be studied but may be allowed when the street can provide unrestricted traffic flow Collectors Parking should be studied but may be allowed when the street can provide unrestricted traffic flow
