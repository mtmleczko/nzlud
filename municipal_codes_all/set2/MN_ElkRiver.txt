PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Elk River, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through November 19, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Peter Beck, City Attorney, and Ms. Sandy Peine, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 2-132. - Intent of division; conflicts of interest prohibited. 
    The credibility of the local government rests heavily upon the confidence which citizens have in public officials and employees to render fair and impartial services to all citizens without regard to personal interest and/or political influence. Thus, city officials and employees must scrupulously avoid any activity which suggests a conflict of interest between their private interests and city responsibilities. Officials and employees of the city, or their family members, shall not engage or have financial interest in any business or other activity which could reasonably lead to a conflict of interest with the official's or employee's primary city responsibilities. Family members of an official or employee shall be deemed to be the official's or employee's spouse, parents, children, siblings, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law and the lineal descendants of any of them. Examples of activities which are not in accordance with this policy include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Entering into any sale, lease, or contract in violation of Minn. Stats. §§ 471.87-471.89; 
(2)  Acceptance by a local official of any gift from an interested person in violation of Minn. Stats. § 471.895; 
(3)  Activities which require the official or employee to interpret city codes, ordinances, or regulations which such activity involves matters with which the official or employee has business and/or family ties; 
(4)  Consulting activities carried out within the city if such consulting involves talents or skills primarily related to the official's or employee's city work responsibilities; 
(5)  Using an official's or employee's authority, influence, or city position for the purpose of private or personal financial gain; 
(6)  The use of city time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for the purpose of private or personal financial gain; 
(7)  Entering into a business transaction when it involves using confidential information gained in the course of employment; 
(8)  Accepting other employment or public office where it will affect the official's or employee's independence of judgment or require use of confidential information gained as a result of city duties; 
(9)  Conducting personal business while working regularly scheduled hours; and 
(10)  Accepting rebates or procuring any financial gain through the bidding process or employment of outside personnel. 
(Ord. No. 99-33, § 2(220.00), 12-20-1999) 
Sec. 2-133. - Enforcement. 
    Any official or employee engaging in any activity involving either an actual or potential conflict of interest or having knowledge of such activity by another official or employee shall promptly report the activity to the city administrator, or, if such activity be by the city administrator, to the mayor. The city administrator or mayor shall investigate the matter and make a determination as to whether or not an actual or potential conflict exists. If the city administrator or mayor determines a conflict exists, it shall be presumed that the continuation of the practice would be injurious to the effectiveness of the official or employee in carrying out his duties and responsibilities. In such cases the official or employee shall immediately terminate the conflicting activity or be subject to termination of employment or removal from office.

The council, in its discretion, may determine the appropriate body to conduct the hearing, and shall so name such body in the council action by which such hearing is called. Such hearing shall be conducted upon written notice to the licensee served in person or by certified mail not less than ten and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing date, stating the time, place, and purpose thereof. 
(d)  Presumptive civil penalties. The purpose of this subsection is to establish standards by which the city council may determine appropriate penalties, including fines, suspensions, and revocations, for violations of this chapter or other laws and regulations. These standards shall apply to all licenses granted under this division. The penalties set forth in this subsection are presumed to be appropriate for every case; however, the council may deviate from these penalties in any case in which the council finds that there exist substantial reasons for such deviation, such as, by way of example and not of limitation, a licensee's efforts in cooperation with the state or city to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors. When deviating from these standards, the council shall provide written findings that support the penalty selected. 
(1)  The following minimum penalties shall be presumed appropriate: 
a.  Upon a finding that a licensee has committed a violation of one of the following types, the license may be revoked: 
1.  Commission of a felony related to the licensed activity. 
2.  Sale of alcoholic beverages while the license is under suspension. 
3.  Sale of intoxicating liquor where the license is only for sale of 3.2 percent malt liquor.

Number of Violations During 24-Month Period Presumptive Penalty First Violation $500.00 civil penalty Second violation 5-day suspension and $1,000.00 civil penalty to be paid before the expiration of the suspension Third violation 10-day suspension and $2,000.00 civil penalty to be paid before the expiration of the suspension Fourth violation License revocation  
_____ 
(2)  For the purposes of this section regarding penalties for violations relevant to licensing, the number of violations by a licensee shall be cumulative over a 24-month period on a rolling basis. Thus, after the end of 24 months following the day a violation occurred, that violation shall be removed from consideration for purposes of applying the grid to determine penalties. Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the discretion of the council with regard to determination of the appropriate penalty for any violation. 
(3)  Nothing in this subsection shall restrict or limit the authority of the council to suspend the license for up to 60 days, revoke the license, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000.00, impose conditions, or take any other action in accordance with law, provided that the license holder has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing in the manner provided in this chapter. 
(e)  Return of revoked license to city. Whenever any license issued for any purpose under this division is revoked for any reason whatever, the licensee shall forthwith return such license to the city clerk, and it shall be the duty of the police officer or other person notifying such licensee or person operating under such revoked license immediately to remove or cause to be removed such license from the wall or other place where such license shall be posted or exhibited and return such license to the city clerk.

Sec. 6-138. - Social host. 
(a)  Purpose and findings. The Elk River City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Elk River City Council finds that: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(5)  Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
(6)  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

(3)  Event or gathering means any group of three or more persons who have assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other activity. 
(4)  Host means to aid, conduct, sponsor, allow, entertain, organize, supervise, control, or permit a gathering or event.

a.  As [a] natural, adoptive parent, or step-parent; 
b.  As a legal guardian; or 
c.  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court. 
(6)  Person means any individual, partnership, co-partnership, corporation, or any association of one or more individuals. "Person" does not include a city, county, or state agency.

(e)  Enforcement. This section can be enforced by any police officer or sheriff's deputy in the county. 
(f)  Severability. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, word, or other portion of this section is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional or invalid, in whole, or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this law, which remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.

b.  The owner has paid the annual license fee; 
c.  The owner has had a microchip identification implanted in the potentially dangerous dog.

d.  The remaining requirements of this article and this section, except subsections (4) and (5), have been met. 
(3)  Inspection. A pre-license inspection of the premises to insure compliance with the city code is required. If the city issues a license to the owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the city shall be allowed at any reasonable time to inspect the dog, the proper enclosure and all places where the animal is kept. 
(4)  Warning symbol. The owner of a dangerous dog licensed under this section must post a sign with the uniform dangerous dog warning symbol on the property in order to inform children that there is a dangerous dog on the property. The sign will be provided by the city upon issuance of the license. 
(5)  Tags. A dangerous dog licensed under this section must wear a standardized, easily identifiable tag at all times that contains the uniform dangerous dog symbol, identifying the dog as dangerous. The tag shall be provided by the city upon issuance of the license.

Sec. 10-94. - Properly restrained in proper enclosure or outside of proper enclosure. 
(a)  Dangerous dog. While on the owner's property, the owner of a dangerous dog must keep it in a proper enclosure. Inside a residential home, there must be a secured area maintained where the dog will stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration. 
(b)  Potentially dangerous dog. While on the owner's property, the owner of a potentially dangerous dog must keep it inside a building which the dog cannot exit of its own volition, or within a fenced or other secured area inspected and approved by the city which the dog cannot exit of its own volition. If the dog is off the owner's property, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration.

A person who owns or possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog and who will rent property from another where the dog will reside must disclose to the property owner prior to entering the lease agreement and at the time of any lease renewal periods that the person owns or possesses a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog that will reside at the property. A dog owner, who is currently renting property, must notify the property owner within 14 days of city notification if the owned dog is newly declared as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous" and the owner keeps the dog on the property. 
(c)  Transfer of ownership into the city. No dog that has been previously determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous by another jurisdiction shall be kept, owned or harbored in the city unless the dog's owner complies with the requirements of this section prior to bringing the dog into the city.

    Self-service merchandising means open displays of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices in any manner where any person shall have access to the tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices without the assistance or intervention of the licensee or the licensee's employee.

(Ord. No. 08-08, §§ 1, 2, 7-21-2008; Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 1-5-2015; Ord. No. 15-32, § 1, 10-19-2015) 
Sec. 26-32. - Purpose of article. 
    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, and electronic delivery devices, and that such sales, possession, and use are violations of both state and federal laws, and because studies, which are hereby accepted and adopted, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking, and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this article shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices for the purpose of enforcing existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices and to prevent young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stats. § 144.391. 
    Unregulated electronic delivery devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or other substances created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a number of e-cigarettes from two leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA's testing also suggested that quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent. (Summary of results: Laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by FDA, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), July 22, 2009; http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm173146.htm) 
    E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. 
(Ord. No. 08-08, §§ 1, 2, 7-21-2008; Ord. No. 15-01, § 2, 1-5-2015; Ord. No. 15-32, § 2, 10-19-2015) 
Sec. 26-33. - Responsibility of licensee for acts of employees. 
    All licensees under this article shall be responsible for the actions of their employees in regard to the sale of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices on the licensed premises, and the sale of such an item by an employee shall be considered a sale by the license holder. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the city from also subjecting the clerk to whatever penalties are appropriate under this article, state or federal law, or other applicable law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 08-08, §§ 1, 2, 7-21-2008; Ord. No. 15-01, § 3, 1-5-2015) 
Sec. 26-34. - Inspection of licensed premises. 
    All licensed premises shall be open to inspection by the city police department or other authorized city official during regular business hours. 
(Ord. No. 08-08, §§ 1, 2, 7-21-2008) 
Sec. 26-35. - Compliance checks. 
(a)  Authorized. From time to time, but at least once per year, the city shall conduct unannounced compliance checks at each location where tobacco, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices are sold to test compliance with Minn. Stats. §§ 609.685 and 609.6855. 
(b)  Use of minors to conduct checks. 
(1)  The city shall conduct compliance checks by engaging, with the written consent of their parents or guardians, minors over the age of 15 years but less than 18 years, to enter the licensed premises to attempt to purchase tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices. 
(2)  Minors used for the purpose of compliance checks shall be supervised by designated law enforcement officers or other designated city personnel. 
(3)  Minors used for compliance checks shall not be guilty of the unlawful purchase or attempted purchase or the unlawful possession of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices when such items are obtained or attempted to be obtained as a part of the compliance check. 
(4)  No minor used in compliance checks shall attempt to use a false identification misrepresenting the minor's age, and all minors lawfully engaged in a compliance check shall answer all questions about the minor's age asked by the licensee or his employee, and shall produce any identification, if any exists, for which he is asked. 
(c)  State and federal compliance checks. Nothing in this section shall prohibit compliance checks authorized by state or federal laws for educational, research, or training purposes, or required for the enforcement of a particular state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 08-08, §§ 1, 2, 7-21-2008; Ord. No. 15-01, § 4, 1-5-2015) 
Sec. 26-36. - Exceptions and defenses. 
    Nothing in this article shall prevent the provision of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, nicotine, or electronic delivery devices to a minor as part of a lawfully recognized religious, spiritual, or cultural ceremony. It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this article for a person to have relied in good faith upon proof of age as described in Minn. Stats. § 340A.503, subd. 6. 
    The penalties in section 26-73 do not apply to a person under the age of 18 years who purchases or attempts to purchase tobacco, tobacco-related devices or electronic delivery devices while under the direct supervision of a responsible adult for training, education, research, or enforcement purposes. 
    A product containing or delivering nicotine intended for human consumption, or any part of such a product, that is not tobacco or an electronic delivery device, as defined by section 26-31, may be sold to persons under the age of 18 if the product has been approved or otherwise certified for legal sale by the United States Food and Drug Administration for tobacco use cessation, harm reduction, or for other medical purposes, and is being marketed and sold solely for that approved purpose.

ARTICLE III. - CLEANUP OF CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB SITES AND CHEMICAL DUMP SITES 

Sec. 26-91. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to reduce public exposure to health risks where law enforcement officers have determined that hazardous chemicals or residue from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated dump site may exist. Professional reports, based on assessments, testing and investigations, show that chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces, furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The city council finds that such sites, and the personal property within such sites, may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site or using or being exposed to contaminated personal property. 
(b)  Interpretation and application. In the interpretation and application of this article, the provisions herein shall be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this article are either more or less restrictive to the public than comparable provisions imposed by any other law, ordinance, statute, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements on the public shall prevail. Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare any section or subpart of this article to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the article as a whole or any part thereof, other than the provision declared invalid.

Sec. 26-94. - Law enforcement action.

The obligation to promptly notify the persons and organizations mentioned above may be delayed to accomplish appropriate law enforcement objectives, but only to the extent that public health and child protection responsibilities are not unnecessarily compromised. 
(Ord. No. 06-05, 3-20-2006) 
Sec. 26-95. - Seizure of property. 
    When the clandestine drug lab site or chemical dump site is inside a vehicle, boat, trailer or other form of moveable personal property, law enforcement authorities shall immediately seize it and not allow it to be transported except to a more secure location.

Sec. 30-327. - Dedication of land or contribution of cash for public purpose. 
(a)  Dedications for park purposes required . In every subdivision of land to be developed for residential, commercial, or industrial uses, or as a planned unit development which includes such uses or any combination thereof, it is reasonable to require that an amount of land shall be set aside and dedicated by the tract owner or owners to the city for parks, playgrounds, trails, or public open space. The amount of land that shall be dedicated shall be in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Residential uses . 
a.  The amount of land to be dedicated shall satisfy the parkland standard of 0.03 acres per person as established, and as may be amended, in the park and recreation system plan. The total amount of land to be dedicated shall be calculated by multiplying the proposed number of dwelling units in each land use designation by the required acres of land to be dedicated per dwelling unit as shown below. The acres of land dedicated per dwelling unit has been determined by multiplying the parkland standard of 0.03 acres per person by the number of persons per dwelling unit, as determined by analyzing the most recent census data specific to the City of Elk River. 
_____ 
Land use designation Acres of land dedicated per person Persons per household Acres of land dedicated per dwelling unit Low density residential 0.03 X 2.82 = 0.0846 Medium density residential 0.03 X 1.80 = 0.0540 High density residential 0.03 X 1.58 = 0.0474  
_____ 
b.  Specialized housing uses . 
1.  Facilities providing 24 hour a day/seven day a week care, such as assisted living or nursing home facilities, shall be subject to park dedication requirements equivalent to commercial uses. 
2.  Facilities with a combination of senior independent living and 24/seven care shall make the required dedication based on the number of units designated for each type of use. 
(2)  Commercial and industrial uses . The amount of land to be dedicated shall be a percentage of the buildable land proposed to be subdivided. The percentage to be dedicated shall be eight percent for commercial and office uses and six percent for industrial uses. 
(3)  Mixed uses . The amount of land to be dedicated shall be calculated based on the percentage of land area devoted to each use, except in the case of mixed use projects within the same building where the amount of land to be dedicated shall be calculated based on the percentage of square feet devoted to each use. 
(b)  Cash contribution in lieu of land dedication . If the city council, in its sole discretion, determines that all or a portion of the land proposed to be dedicated is unsuitable for parks, then the tract owner shall contribute to the city prior to releasing the final subdivision, in lieu of park land dedication, a cash contribution proportionate to the fair market value of the land, and set forth in the city's fee schedule. If the applicant disputes the amount of the proposed cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication, the applicant, at their own expense, may obtain an appraisal of the property. The appraisal shall be made by approved members of the MAI, or equivalent real estate appraisal societies. If the city disputes such appraisal the city may, at the applicant's expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraisal. 
(c)  Buildable land . For the purposes of calculating the required dedication described in this section, shall be defined as the gross acres less the area of wetlands, lakes, and streams below the OHWL. 
(d)  Replatted property . Previously subdivided property from which a park dedication has been received, being re-subdivided with the same number of lots, is exempt from park dedication requirements. If, as a result of re-subdividing the property, the number of lots is increased, then the park dedication or per-lot cash fee must apply only to the net increase of lots. 
(e)  Use of cash contributions . Any monies paid to the city in lieu of park dedication shall be placed in a special fund and used only for the acquisition and development or improvement of parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space based on the approved park systems plan. Cash payments must not be used for ongoing operation or maintenance of parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space. 
(f)  Dedications for purposes other than parks . In addition, in every subdivision of land, the land required for public streets, regional stormwater holding ponds and wetlands shall be set aside and dedicated on the subdivision by the owners to the city for these purposes. These areas will not be credited towards park dedication requirements. 
(g)  Criteria for determining suitability of land . The suitability of land proposed to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be determined by reference to the following criteria: 
(1)  Whether the land is reasonably located and suited for its intended use. 
(2)  Whether the land has frontage on public or private roads as determined by the city. 
(3)  Size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access, and location. 
(4)  Consistency with the goals and objectives of the master park and recreation plan. 
(h)  Improvements to dedicated land . As part of the subdivision approval, the tract owner shall be responsible for making certain improvements to land dedicated for park, trail and public open space purposes, including, but not limited to, finish grading, ground cover, construction of trails and clearly identifying park and trail boundaries with city-approved markers. 
(i)  Credit for construction of recreational facilities . Park dedication credit shall not be granted for the construction of recreational facilities unless specifically approved by the city council. The submission for review by staff and the park and recreation commission shall include an estimate of installation costs, equipment specifications and a site plan. The park and recreation commission shall review such improvements for appropriateness with the park and trail master plan. 
(j)  Consultation by developer with city staff . As part of the application procedure at the time of submitting the subdivision, the tract owner is encouraged to confer with city staff and the park and recreation commission to secure a recommendation as to the location of any property that should be dedicated to the public for park and recreation purposes. 
(k)  Survey required . As part of any park dedication of land, a survey at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet shall be provided with topographic data, based on city datum, including contours at vertical intervals of at least two feet, watercourses, wetlands, marshes, rock outcrops, easements, utilities and vegetative data. This data shall also be provided in a format which is readable by Arc View TM GIS. Portions of any property dedicated to the public for park and recreation purposes to be used for borrow and fill activities elsewhere in the development shall be clearly identified.

The SWPPP must be submitted for review and approved prior to any land-disturbing activities. The SWPPP will designate the temporary and permanent erosion control measures to be incorporated in the site development. The SWPPP must meet the requirements described in the MPCA NPDES construction permit, Part III as well as the required contents and format of the SWPPP described in the City of Elk River Engineering Design Guidelines. 
(2)  Sites with less than 20,000 square feet of disturbed area are required to meet the provisions of the MPCA NPDES construction site permit Part IV related to erosion and sediment control. This requirement applies to construction sites permitted by a building and or grading permit issued by the City of Elk River. 
(3)  Construction sites must have perimeter best management practices and construction site entrances installed and inspected before the City of Elk River will issue a permit for building. 
(4)  Frozen ground conditions do not exempt a site from complying with the requirements of this chapter. At the applicant's request alternative perimeter controls may be implemented in place of the required silt fence installation. A "Frozen Ground Agreement" must be completed, signed and submitted. 
(5)  The following guidelines shall be applied at the city's discretion: 
a.  The development shall conform to the topography and soils so as to create the least potential for soil erosion. 
b.  Erosion and sediment control measures shall be coordinated with the different stages of development. Appropriate control measures shall be installed prior to development when necessary to control erosion. 
c.  The smallest practical increment of land shall be exposed at any one time during development. 
d.  When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible period of time. 
e.  Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set aside for respreading over the developed area. The soil shall be restored to a depth of four inches and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development. 
f.  Critical erosion areas exposed during construction shall be protected with temporary vegetation, mulching or other acceptable means. 
g.  Sediment basins (debris basins, silting basins, or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land subject to earth disturbance activities. 
h.  Diversions shall be installed to divert surface water runoff from slopes of ten percent or steeper. 
i.  Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate increased runoff from slopes of ten percent or steeper. 
j.  Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical (3:1) unless stabilized by a retaining wall, riprap, or other acceptable means. 
k.  During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control, as required by the city, shall be implemented. 
(p)  Inspection. 
(1)  Generally. All grading operations for which erosion controls measures are required shall be subject to inspection by the city. 
(2)  Regular site inspection. The city shall inspect sites permitted for construction by building permits, grading permits and subdivision development. The inspections will be made to insure conformance with the SWPPP and with the requirements of the MPCA NPDES construction permit as they apply to the site. This regular site inspection does not relieve the applicant of their responsibility to conduct site inspections as required in the MPCA NPDES construction permit. 
(3)  The costs associated with regular site inspections will be the responsibility of the applicant. In the case of sites less than 20,000 square feet this fee will be charged at issuance of the building permit at a rate set in the schedule of fees approved by the city council. 
(4)  Regular grading requirements. The city may require inspection and testing by an approved testing agency. The testing agency's responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, approval concerning the inspection of cleared areas and benches to receive fill, and the compaction of fills. When the city has cause to believe that geologic factors may be involved the grading operation will be required to conform to "engineered grading" requirements. 
(5)  Notification of noncompliance. If, in the course of fulfilling his responsibility under this chapter, the designer, the soils engineer, the engineering geologist or the testing agency finds that the work is not being done in conformance with this ordinance or the reviewed grading plans, the discrepancies shall be reported immediately in writing to the person in charge of grading work and to the city. Recommendations for corrective measures, if necessary, shall be submitted. 
(6)  Transfer of responsibility for approval. If the designer, the soils engineer, the engineering geologist or the testing agency of record is changed during the course of the work, the work shall be stopped until the replacement has agreed to accept the responsibility within the area of his technical competence for approval upon completion of the work. 
(q)  Completion of work. 
(1)  Final reports. Upon completion of the rough grading work and at the final completion of the work the city may require the following reports, drawings and supplements thereto: 
a.  An as-graded grading plan prepared by the designer including original ground surface elevations, as-graded ground surface elevations, lot drainage patterns and locations and elevations of all surface and subsurface drainage facilities. The designer shall state that to the best of his knowledge the work was done in accordance with the final reviewed grading plan. 
b.  A soils-grading report prepared by the soils engineer, including locations and elevations of field density tests, summaries of field and laboratory tests and other substantiating data and comments on any changes made during grading and their effect on the recommendations made in the soils engineering investigation report. The soil engineer shall render a finding as to the adequacy of the site for the intended use. 
c.  A geologic grading report prepared by the engineering geologist, including a final description of the geology of the site and any new information disclosed during the grading and the effect of same on recommendations incorporated in the approved grading plan. The geologic engineer shall render a finding as to the adequacy of the site for the intended use as affected by geologic factors. 
(2)  Notification of completion. The permittee or his agent shall notify the city when the grading operation is ready for final inspection. Final approval shall not be given until all work, including installation of all drainage facilities and their protective devices, and all erosion-control measures, has been completed and turf has been established in accordance with the final reviewed grading plan and the required reports have been submitted. 
    Reference nuisance language. 
(r)  Penalty. Any person convicted of violating this chapter[section] shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment in the county jail, or both, as specified by state statute. Such penalty may be imposed in addition to suspension or revocation of the grading permit.

Sec. 30-417. - Drainage. 
    The natural drainage system shall be used to the maximum extent feasible for the storage and flow of runoff. The design of the drainage system shall conform to the city's overall stormwater management plan and best management practices as established by MPCA. The following requirements shall also apply: 
(1)  Proposed drainage facilities shall have adequate capacity to accommodate potential runoff from their entire upstream drainage area, whether within or without the subdivision. The effect of the subdivision on existing downstream drainage areas outside the subdivision shall be considered in evaluating the adequacy of the stormwater management plan. 
(2)  Stormwater runoff shall be discharged to marsh lands, swamps, retention basins or other treatment facilities. Marsh lands and swamps used for stormwater shall provide for natural or artificial water level control. 
(3)  No existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal shall be deepened, widened, rerouted or filled without review and approval by the city. 
(4)  Where artificial channels must be constructed to augment the natural drainage system, such channels as well as the natural drainageways may be planned as part of a recreational trail system. Channels shall be designed to be aesthetically compatible for recreational trail use. 
(5)  Quality of stormwater runoff and water infiltrated to the water table shall remain undisturbed, to the maximum extent feasible, by development of the subdivision. 
(6)  The drainage system shall be constructed and operational as part of the first stage of development and construction. 
(7)  All existing and proposed drainage facilities shall be located within the drainage and utility easement. 
(Code 1982, § 1008.14(9)) 
Sec. 30-418. - Easements. 
    All easements shall be dedicated by appropriate language on the plat as required by law and in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Easements at least ten feet wide, centered on rear and other lot lines, and ten feet wide along front lot lines, shall be provided. All easements along the plat boundary shall be ten feet wide, or a minimum of five feet wide if abutting an existing drainage and utility easement on the adjacent property, and ten feet wide along rights-of-way. Easements shall have continuity of alignment from block to block. No fences, driveways, paved surfaces, other structures, or plantings other than grass can be placed in a utility easement where they will interfere with the maintenance of such utilities, unless approved by the city. If removal of a fence, other structure, or planting is necessitated for maintenance of utilities, the cost of removal and replacement is the responsibility of the affected property owner. 
(2)  Easements shall be provided along each side of the centerline of any watercourse or drainage channel, whether or not shown in the comprehensive development plan, to a width sufficient to provide proper maintenance and for stormwater runoff for the designed storm event determined by the city, but such easements shall not be less than 20 feet in width. 
(3)  Easements shall be provided along lot lines or across property to accommodate the extension and maintenance of utility lines. Easement width is typically ten feet; however, the width may vary depending upon the type of utility the easement is to serve. 
(4)  Where any plat, replat or subdivision of land adjoins a natural lake, pond or stream, including streams which flow only intermittently, the city, in its discretion, may require that a strip of land running along all sides thereof which are contiguous to such lake, pond or stream shall be either (i) dedicated to the city for public use or (ii) subject to a perpetual easement in favor of the city over and in such land and the bed and water body of such lake, pond, or stream for the purpose of protecting the hydraulic efficiency and the natural character and beauty of such lake, pond, or stream. The planning commission shall determine which of these options is more appropriate and shall recommend to the city council one of such options. In either case, there shall also be granted to the city the right of ingress to and egress from such strip of land with men, equipment and materials. Where the easement is determined to be in the best interests of the city, the easement shall also provide that the owners of the areas as to which the easement is granted shall not make, do, or place any fill, grading, improvement or development of any kind on or to such easement area, or raise the level of the easement area in any way, but all such right to fill, grade, improve and develop and to raise the level of the easement area shall be granted by the easement to the city.

Sec. 30-516. - Calculation of base density; density bonuses. 
(a)  To calculate the base density for a given tract for open space preservation plat purposes, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Determine the eligible land (see definition in section 30-1). 
(2)  In the R-1a zoning district, divide the eligible land by 2.5 then multiply by 1.15 to determine the number of lots. 
Example: 
Eligible land area: 24 acres 
Zoning district density: 2.5 acres 
OSP density: (24/2.5) × 1.15 = 11.04, or 11 lots 
(3)  In the A-1 zoning district, divide the eligible land by ten and multiply by 2.15 to determine the number of lots. 
Example: 
Eligible land area: 42 acres 
Zoning district density: ten acres 
OSP density: (42/10) × 2.15 = 9.03, or nine lots 
(b)  At the discretion of the city council, density bonuses may be permitted which allow projects to be developed at a density greater than otherwise allowed provided that one or more of the following standards are complied with. Each standard provides an additional density increase above the allowed zoning district density with a maximum density increase of 40 percent above the allowed zoning district base density. 
(1)  Creating an endowment to the land trust or homeowners' association where the principal would generate sufficient annual interest to cover the conservation easement holder's yearly costs (five percent bonus). 
(2)  Providing for access by the general public to trails, parks, or other recreational facilities, excluding golf courses (five percent bonus). 
(3)  Providing an additional ten percent open space above the required 50 percent preserved eligible land. The additional ten percent open space shall be buildable area (five percent bonus). 
(4)  Reusing existing buildings and structures or preserving specific site features inventoried by the county, city, or state historical preservation office (five percent bonus). 
(5)  Providing covenants to create an architectural theme to include items such as porches, side or rear loaded or detached garages (five percent bonus). Landscape theme, lighting theme, and open space/central meeting place shall make up 2.5 percent of the density bonus and additional architectural elements shall make up 2.5 percent of the density bonus. A written narrative describing the architectural theme shall be provided with the preliminary plat. 
(6)  Maximum lot size one-half acre (five percent bonus). 
Example: 
R1a district eligible land area: 24 acres 
Density bonus: (24/2.5) × 0.05 = 0.48 
Each 5% bonus = 0.48 lots 
A-1 district eligible land area: 42 acres 
Density bonus: (42/10) × 0.05 = 0.21 
Each 5% bonus = 0.21 lots

Sec. 30-635. - Variances. 
(a)  A variance may be requested only by the owner of the property (petitioner) to which the variance would apply.

(b)  A variance may be granted by the board only if it finds that: 
(1)  The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance. 
(2)  The variance is consistent with the City of Elk River comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Variances may be granted when the petitioner establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with the zoning ordinance. Practical difficulties means that: 
(1)  The petitioner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning ordinance; 
(2)  The plight of the petitioner is due to circumstances unique to the property not a consequence of the petition's own action or inaction; and 
(3)  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(d)  Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.

(13)  Permitted home occupations may not involve repair of internal combustion engines or use of equipment which is not normally found in a home, except that equipment which is typically in an office may be used. 
(d)  Conditional home occupations . Home occupations that do not involve prohibited activities but that exceed the permitted home occupation criteria may be allowed with approval of a conditional use permit by the city council pursuant to the provisions of subdivision II of division 2 of this article. 
(e)  Inspections . The city may at any reasonable time inspect the home occupation to determine if the applicant is strictly adhering to the criteria for a permitted home occupation or the conditions placed on a conditional home occupation. 
(f)  Revocation or expiration of a conditional use permit for home occupations .

Sec. 30-852. - Purpose, scope, and findings of subdivision. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this subdivision shall be to coordinate the type, placement, and physical dimensions of signs within the different zoning districts, to recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of the business community, to encourage the innovative use of design, to promote both renovation and proper maintenance, to allow for special circumstances, and to guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate recordkeeping and consistent enforcement. These shall be accompanied by regulation of the display, erection, use, and maintenance of signs. 
(b)  Scope . It is not the purpose or intent of this subdivision II to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of this subdivision to regulate any building design, or any display not defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside of a building. 
(c)  Findings. 
    The city finds: 
(1)  Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment. 
(2)  Signs provide an important medium that may convey a variety of messages. 
(3)  Signs can create traffic hazards and aesthetic concerns, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare. 
(4)  The city's zoning regulations include the regulation of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location, number and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.

This district is intended to provide single-family residences in areas with full municipal public sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and municipal water in areas that are a continuation of existing residential development patterns and the infilling of existing lots in established areas. 
(5)  R-1d district. This district is intended to provide single-family residential districts with larger lots and higher quality housing types in areas with full municipal public sewers, storm sewers, and municipal water in areas that possess significant natural features, including vegetation, wetlands, and topographic features. This district is intended to encourage the design of subdivisions that protect natural features while providing high quality housing sites.

(Code 1982, § 900.12(21)) 
Sec. 30-1837. - AT antenna tower overlay district. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the antenna tower overlay district is to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, and to accommodate the telecommunication needs of residents and businesses by providing a specific zoning district for the use of land for the establishment and operation of wireless telecommunication towers. Since this use is unique, a special zoning district is appropriate, and the city reserves the right to determine the suitability of a rezoning request to antenna tower overlay district based on criteria which includes the following: 
(1)  The compatibility of the rezoning request with surrounding land uses. 
(2)  That the proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide effective wireless telecommunication coverage for the city. 
(3)  The rezoning is in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the city. 
Wireless telecommunication towers shall not be permitted nor allowed as conditional uses in any other zoning district. This section shall apply to all towers over 60 feet in height. 
(b)  Findings. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare, the city council finds these regulations necessary in order to: 
(1)  Establish standards which permit a reasonable and equitable opportunity for the establishment of wireless telecommunication service in the city. 
(2)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements. 
(3)  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards which attempt to screen and/or camouflage towers and antennas from adjacent private and public property. 
(4)  Maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings and other structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community. 
(c)  Uses. The antenna tower overlay district (AT) is an overlay zoning district; land zoned into the AT will also maintain its original zoning classification. All permitted, accessory, and conditional uses allowed in the underlying zoning district will continued to be allowed on land rezoned to AT, subject to all restrictions and requirements applicable in the underlying district. In addition to the uses allowed in the underlying district, the following uses shall be allowed as a conditional use in the AT: antenna arrays, including radio, television, commercial wireless telecommunication, and microwave transmitting and receiving equipment, supporting towers, buildings and enclosures accessory to the tower and antennas. 
(d)  Collocation requirements. All commercial wireless telecommunication towers erected, constructed, or located within the city shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  A proposal for a new commercial wireless communication service tower shall not be approved unless the city finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower, building or other structure within a one mile search radius (one-half-mile search radius for towers under 120 feet in height, one-quarter-mile search radius for towers under 80 feet in height) of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons: 
a.  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower, building or structure, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower or structure cannot be modified, reinforced or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost. 
b.  The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower, building or structure as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
c.  Existing or approved towers, buildings or structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer. 
d.  Other unforeseen reasons make it not feasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower, building or structure. 
(2)  Any proposed wireless telecommunication service tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects constructed, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future arrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights. 
(e)  Construction requirements. All antennas erected, constructed, or located within the city shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  All applicable provisions of this Code. 
(2)  Towers and their antennas shall be certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer to conform to the latest structural standards and wind loading requirements of the Uniform Building Code and the Electronics Industry Association and all other applicable reviewing agencies. 
(3)  With the exception of necessary electric and telephone service and connection lines approved by the city, no part of any antenna or tower nor any lines, cable, equipment or wires or braces in connection with either shall at any time extend across or over any part of any right-of-way, public street, highway, sidewalk, or property line. 
(4)  Towers and their antennas shall be designed to conform with accepted electrical engineering methods and practices and comply with the provisions of the National Electrical Code. 
(5)  All signal and remote control conductors of low energy extending substantially horizontally above the ground between a tower or antenna and a structure, or between towers, shall be at least eight feet above the ground at all points, unless buried underground. 
(6)  All towers shall be protected against unauthorized climbing. The bottom of the tower (measured from ground level to 12 feet above ground level) shall be constructed in such a manner to preclude unauthorized climbing. The tower, antenna and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by an eight-foot-high chain link fence with a locked gate. 
(7)  Metal towers shall be constructed of, or treated with, corrosive resistant material. 
(8)  Only one tower shall exist at any one time on any lot or parcel. The minimum lot size requirement shall be one acre. 
(f)  Design standards. All antennas erected, constructed, or located within the city shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of building materials, color, textures, camouflaging architectural treatment, screening and landscaping, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(2)  Commercial wireless telecommunication service towers shall be of a monopole design unless the city council determines that an alternative design is preferred. 
(g)  Signs and advertising. No advertising, logos or identification of any kind is permitted, except as may be required by federal and state authorities. 
(h)  Accessory structures and equipment. 
(1)  All accessory equipment related to towers and antennas must be housed within a structure. Existing structures shall be used whenever possible. Any new accessory buildings or structures shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment. 
(2)  The use of compatible materials such as wood, brick, or stucco is required for associated support buildings. Equipment located on the roof of an existing building shall be screened from public view with building materials identical to or compatible with existing materials. 
(3)  Ground-mounted structures shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of nonvegetative screening better reflects and compliments the architectural character of the surrounding area. Removal of existing vegetation shall be minimized through careful site selection and design. 
(i)  Illumination. Towers and antennas shall not be illuminated or display strobe lights unless specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority. When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower at the city's discretion. 
(j)  Tower setbacks and tower height. Towers shall conform with each of the following requirements: 
(1)  Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and an adjoining public street. 
(2)  In industrial zones towers and accessory structures shall be set back 30 feet from the front property line, 25 feet from the side property line and 20 feet from the rear property line. In all other zones and from any property line abutting a residential use, towers and accessory structures shall meet setback requirements equal to the height of the tower from all property lines. 
(3)  The maximum height of any tower, including antennas and other attachments, shall not exceed 150 feet. 
(4)  The height of a tower may be increased by 24 feet to accommodate each additional user above those required by collocation up to a maximum height of 198 feet. 
(5)  Engineered fall zone analysis shall be conducted by a qualified structural engineer. This report shall specify in writing that any collapse of the tower would occur within a specified fall zone within a lesser distance than the setback. 
(k)  Time limit on tower completion. Once a tower is approved by the city, the tower must be substantially completed within one year, including any structures accompanying the tower, following the date of tower approval. 
(l)  Interference with public safety telecommunications. No new or existing telecommunication service shall interfere with public safety telecommunication. All applications for new service shall be accompanied by an intermodulation study which provides a technical evaluation of existing and proposed transmissions and indicates all potential interference problems. Before the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the city at least ten calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the city to monitor interference levels during the testing process. 
(m)  Support of public warning systems. Telecommunication providers that utilize antennas erected after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall participate in the emergency alert system (EAS), as defined by FCC rules and regulations, part 11, by broadcasting warnings of severe weather and other life-threatening emergencies to users of personal communications equipment served by the antennas. Telecommunication providers may be exempt from the requirements of this section under the following circumstances: 
(1)  The telecommunication provider demonstrates that participation in EAS is not technologically feasible; 
(2)  The telecommunication provider is unable to acquire any FCC waiver or exemption from licensing or other regulations that would prohibit participation in EAS; or

Sec. 30-1852. - Performance standards. 
(a)  Wetland buffer strip. A minimum 25-foot buffer strip from the delineated boundary of a wetland or ordinary highwater level of a stormwater pond is hereby established. Wetland buffer strips shall meet the following standards: 
i.  No principle or accessory structures, patios, paving, or other impervious surfaces shall be permitted within the wetland buffer strip. 
ii.  Alterations are prohibited within the wetland and wetland buffer strip, unless a vegetation management plan or other approval is granted by the city. 
iii.  The applicant shall establish and maintain wetland and wetland buffer strip vegetation in accordance with the requirements found in section 30-1853. 
iv.  The applicant shall maintain the required wetland buffer strip monuments at each lot line where it crosses a wetland buffer strip and at 200-foot intervals along the edge of the wetland buffer strip. Each monument shall state "Wetland Buffer: Under the City Code, no mowing, clearing or removal of vegetation in the buffer area is allowed. Call the City of Elk River for more information." The city reserves the right to eliminate this requirement if it deems it impractical. 
v.  The city, at its sole discretion, following the city's master park trail plan, may allow nature trails comprised of natural materials, to be located within the wetland buffer strip. 
vi.  Leisure activities such as hiking, nature studies, canoeing, boating and horseback riding, including facilities such as nature trails and docks which allow for such activities are permitted in the wetland buffer strip. 
vii.  Final plats for all subdivisions shall provide an easement over all wetlands and wetland buffer strips for the purposes of identification and protection. 
viii.  Properties platted prior to June 19, 2006, shall be exempt from the vegetation management requirements described in subsections ii-iv above.

Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 30-1861. - Definitions. 
    The definitions in section 30-1 are applicable in this division. Unless specifically defined in section 30-1, words or phrases used in this division shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as found elsewhere in this Code, or as they have in common usage and so as to give this division its most reasonable application. 
    Conditional use, when used in this division 11 means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 
(1)  Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist. 
(2)  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
    Structure, when used in division 11 of this article, means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting criteria specified in section 30-1935 of this division and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage, as used in this division, means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to it before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement, as used in this division, means, within any 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the building official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(2)  Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure." For the purpose of this division, "historic structure" shall be defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. Variance, when used in division 11 of this article, means a modification of a specific permitted development standards required in an official control including this division, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty, or unique circumstances as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

(Code 1982, § 902.00(1)) 
Sec. 30-1863. - Findings. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  This division is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the state department of natural resources. 
(c)  This division is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the city's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Code 1982, § 902.00(2); Ord. No. 11-05, § 3, 10-17-2011) 
Sec. 30-1864. - Purpose of division. 
    It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 30-1863(a) by provisions contained in this division. 
(Code 1982, § 902.00(3)) 
Sec. 30-1865. - Lands to which division applies. 
    This division shall apply only to those lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway or flood fringe districts.

Sec. 30-1868. - Regulatory flood protection elevation. 
    The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevations caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. The regulatory flood protection elevation for West Twin Lake, which is an approximate A zone without a regional/base flood elevation published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall be elevation 930.1 (National Geodetic Vertical Datum, 1929 adjustment). 
(Code 1982, § 902.02(3); Ord. No. 2000-02, § 2, 3-20-2000) 
Sec. 30-1869. - Amendments. 
(a)  The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the state commissioner of natural resources if he determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use. 
(b)  All amendments to this division, including amendments to the official zoning map, must be submitted to and approved by the commissioner of natural resources prior to adoption. Changes in the official zoning map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's technical conditions and criteria and must receive prior approval from the Federal Emergency Management Agency before adoption. The commissioner of natural resources must be given ten days' written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this division, and the notice shall include a draft of the ordinance amendment or technical study under consideration. 
(Code 1982, § 902.22; Ord. No. 11-05, § 7, 10-17-2011) 
Sec. 30-1870. - Interpretation of division; determination of boundaries of districts. 
(a)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(b)  The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the land development staff, the board of adjustments shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the city adopted its initial floodplain regulations or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the board of adjustments and to submit technical evidence.

Sec. 30-1872. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    This division does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This division shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this division or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this division is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this division shall not be affected thereby.

Sec. 30-1873. - Penalty; additional remedies. 
(a)  Violations of the provisions of this division or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violations of conditions and safeguards, established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses, shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law. 
(b)  Nothing contained in this division shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions may include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  In responding to a suspected violation, the land development staff and the city may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to the city, including but not limited to, prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(2)  When a violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the land development staff, the land development staff shall immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate State Department of Natural Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency regional office along with the city's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible. 
(3)  The land development staff shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this division and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the land development staff may order the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the city. If the construction or development is already completed, then the land development staff may either: 
a.  Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls; or 
b.  Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days. 
(4)  If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the land development staff within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this division and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The land development staff shall also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the violation of this division. 
(Code 1982, § 902.20; Ord. No. 11-05, § 11, 10-17-2011)

Sec. 30-1892. - Permits and certificates. 
(a)  Permit required. A permit issued by the land development staff in conformity with the provisions of this division shall be secured prior to the erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, replacement (including normal maintenance and repair) or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof, prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land, prior to the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, prior to the change or extension of a nonconforming use, prior to the repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source, and prior to the placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within the floodplain. Where required by this division or any other provision of this article, such permits may require prior review and approval by the planning commission and city council. 
(b)  Application for permit. Application for a permit shall be made in duplicate to the land development staff on forms furnished by the land development staff and shall include the following where applicable: Plans in duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill or storage of materials; and their location of the foregoing in relation to the stream channel. 
(c)  State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an application for a conditional use permit or variance, the land development staff shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary state and federal permits. 
(d)  Certificate of zoning compliance. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the land development staff stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this division. 
(e)  Construction and use to comply with approved plans. Permits, conditional use permits, or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this division and punishable as provided by section 30-1873. 
(f)  Certification of elevation and floodproofing. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this division.

Sec. 30-1893. - Board of adjustments; appeals and variances. 
(a)  Powers and duties of board of adjustments. The planning commission, which serves as the board of adjustments under this article pursuant to subdivision II of division 2 of this article, shall be the board of adjustments under this division., with the following powers and duties: 
(1)  The board of adjustments shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or administration of this division. 
(2)  The board of adjustments shall hear and decide requests for variances from the provisions of this division pursuant to the standards set forth in this section. 
    In exercising these powers and duties, the city council shall follow the procedures, rules and regulations established in subdivision II of division 2 of this article. 
(b)  Rules. The board of adjustments shall adopt rules for the conduct of business and may exercise all of the powers conferred on such boards by state law. 
(c)  Variances generally. The board of adjustments may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this division as will not be contrary to the public interest, and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in subdivision II of division 2 of this article. In the granting of such variance, the board of adjustments shall clearly identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in subdivision II of division 2 of this article which justified the granting of the variance. 
(d)  In addition to the criteria set forth in division 2, subdivision II of this article, the following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied for the issuance of a variance for any property within any designated regulatory floodplain: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, and a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
(2)  A determination [of] the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with exiting local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibiting in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(e)  Hearings. The land development staff shall submit by mail to the state commissioner of natural resources a copy of the application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the commissioner will receive at least ten days' notice of the hearing on the variance. 
(f)  Decisions; restrictions on variances. In granting a variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, such as those specified in section 30-1914(3), which are in conformity with the purposes of this division. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this division punishable under section 30-1873. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be forwarded by mail to the commissioner of natural resources within ten days of such action. No variance shall be granted which the city council determines has or will have a tendency to: 
(1)  Increase the height or duration of floodwaters. 
(2)  Result in the placement of an artificial obstruction which will restrict the passage of floodwaters in such a manner as to increase the height of flooding. 
(3)  Result in incompatible land uses or uses which would be detrimental to the protection of surface water and groundwater. 
(4)  Increase the financial burdens imposed on the community land areas within the city. 
(5)  Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for the city or which will increase or cause danger to life or property. 
(6)  Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the preservation of the natural landforms, vegetation and the marshes and wetlands within the city. 
(7)  Include development of land and water areas essential to continue the temporary withholding of rapid runoff of surface water which presently contributes to downstream flooding or water pollution or for land and water areas which provide groundwater infiltration which diminishes the land area necessary to carry increased flows of storm water following a period of heavy precipitation. 
(g)  Appeals from decisions of board. Appeals from any decision of the board may be made as specified in this article and Minnesota Statutes. 
(h)  Flood insurance notice; records and reports. The land development staff shall notify the applicant for a variance that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and that such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. The city shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.

(6)  Placement of fill or construction of fences. 
(7)  Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of subsection 30-1935(c). 
(8)  Structural works for flood control, such as levees, dikes and floodwalls, constructed to any height, where the intent is to protect individual structures, and levees or dikes, where the intent is to protect agricultural crops, for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
(d)  Additional standards for conditional uses. Conditional uses shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  Prohibited uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reaches affected. 
(2)  General standards and procedures. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in this division and in subdivision III of division 2 of this article. 
(3)  Applicability of underlying zoning. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district. 
(4)  Placement or storage of fill or similar material. 
a.  Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable methods. 
b.  Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a longterm site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element in the plan. 
c.  As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (d)(4)b of this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood, but only after the city council has received an appropriate plan which ensures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder. 
(5)  Accessory structures. 
a.  Accessory structures shall not be designed or permitted for human habitation. 
b.  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters. Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow. So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
c.  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structural dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the state building code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, the accessory structure does not exceed 500 square feet in size, and, for a detached garage, the detached garage is used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards, as appropriate: 
1.  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 
2.  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and 
3.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(6)  Storage of materials and equipment. 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city. 
(7)  Structures affecting protected wetlands or public waters. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. ch. 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway. 
(8)  Levees, dikes and floodwalls. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
(Code 1982, § 902.06; Ord. No. 11-05, §§ 17-20, 10-17-2011) 
Sec. 30-1913. - Flood fringe district. 
(a)  Purpose. The flood fringe district is established for areas of the floodplain not a part of the watercourse or channel which would not detract from the discharge of a flood, but are subject to backwaters and inundation during flood stage. Limited development may be permitted in this district provided the development is protected from the floodwaters. 
(b)  Permitted uses generally. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district. The following uses have a low flood damage potential and do not obstruct flood flows. These uses shall be permitted within the flood fringe district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided all permits or authorizations are received as may be required by other city ordinances or regulations of other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. In addition, no use shall adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributary. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe permitted uses listed in subsection (c) of this section and the standards for all flood fringe uses listed in subsection (f) of this section. 
(c)  Additional standards for permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, including the basement floor, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
(2)  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be internally floodproofed in accordance with section 30-1912(d)(5)c. 
(3)  The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section. 
(4)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(5)  The provisions of subsection (f) of this section shall also apply. 
(d)  Conditional uses generally. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section shall only be allowed as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections (e) and (f) of this section and section 30-1914. 
(e)  Additional standards for conditional uses. Conditional uses shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  Alternative elevation methods. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or abovegrade enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered abovegrade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if the enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. These alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
a.  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from entering or accumulating within these components during time of flooding. 
b.  Standards for abovegrade enclosed areas. Abovegrade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
1.  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two automatic openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters without any form of human intervention. 
2.  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
(2)  Basements. Basements shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation, provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (e)(3) of this section. 
(3)  Floodproofing. All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code, and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
(4)  Storage of fill or similar material. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the city is enforcing a state-approved shoreland management ordinance. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(5)  Placement or storage of materials and equipment. 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
(6)  General standards. The provisions of subsection (f) of this section shall also apply. 
(f)  Standards for all uses. All flood fringe uses shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Access. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the board of adjustments must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
(2)  Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots, may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
(3)  Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations, subject to requirements set out in subsection (f)(2) of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
(4)  Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable methods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(5)  Development affecting hydraulic capacity. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
(6)  Travel trailers and travel vehicles. Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in section 30-1935(c). 
(7)  Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Sec. 30-1915. - Nonconforming structures and uses. 
    A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of the ordinance from which this division is derived, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this division, may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(2)  Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the state building code, except as further restricted in subsection (3) and subsection (6) of this section. 
(3)  The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure unless the conditions of this section are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must be calculated into the current cost, which will include all costs such as cost of construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure, then the structure must meet the standards of section 30-1912 or 30-1913 for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively. 
(4)  If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this division. The land development staff shall be responsible for recording in writing instances of nonconforming uses which have been discontinued for a period of 12 months and shall also be responsible for providing written notification of the discontinuance of use to the appropriate party. The assessor shall notify the land development staff in writing of instances of nonconforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of 12 months. 
(5)  If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including floods, to an extent of 50 percent or more of its market value at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this division. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in sections 30-1912 and 30-1913 will apply, depending upon whether the use or structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively. 
(6)  If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in this division, from any combination of a building addition to the outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation, reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing nonconforming building, then the building addition and the existing nonconforming building must meet the requirements of section 30-1912 or 30-1913 of this division for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively.

(3)  Recreational vehicles, exempted under subsections (c)(1) and (c) (2) of this section lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500.00 for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/floodproofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in sections 30-1912 and 30-1913. There shall be no development or improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur. 
(4)  New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and the expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five units or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in the floodway or flood fringe districts, provided the recreational vehicle and its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with subsection 30-1913(f)(1). No fill placed in the floodway to meet the requirements of this section shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or regional flood. 
b.  All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the criteria of subsection (c)(4)a. of this section may, as an alternative, be allowed as a conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the provisions of section 30-1914. The applicant must submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood. The plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual and shall demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation, and shall demonstrate the provisions of subsection(c)(1) of this section will be met. All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or replacement recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with section 30-1934

Sec. 30-1963. - Purpose of division. 
    The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters. The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This responsibility is hereby recognized by the city. 
(Code 1982, § 904.00(2)) 
Sec. 30-1964. - Jurisdiction. 
    The provisions of this division shall apply to the shorelands of the public water bodies as defined in section 30-1 and as classified in subdivision III of this division. Pursuant to Minnesota Regulations parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flowage less than ten acres in size in municipalities need be regulated in a local government's shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the city council, be exempt from this division. 
(Code 1982, § 904.02(1)) 
Sec. 30-1965. - Compliance with applicable regulations. 
    The use of any shoreland of public waters, the size and shape of lots, the use, size, type and location of structures on lots, the installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment systems, the grading and filling of any shoreland area, the cutting of shoreland vegetation, and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations. 
(Code 1982, § 904.02(2)) 
Sec. 30-1966. - Interpretation of division. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this division shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Code 1982, § 904.02(4)) 
Sec. 30-1967. - Effect of division on existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this division to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this division imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(Code 1982, § 904.02(6)) 
Sec. 30-1968. - Penalty. 
    Any violation of the provisions of this division or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses, shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as outlined in section 30-576 and as defined by Minnesota Rules and state statutes.

(Code 1982, § 904.02(3)) 
Sec. 30-1982. - Development permit. 
(a)  A permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (including such related activities as construction of decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by section 30-2023. Application for a permit shall be made to the building and zoning administrator on the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that the building and zoning administrator can determine the site's suitability for the intended use and that a compliant sewage treatment system will be provided. 
(b)  Permits shall stipulate that any identified nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined by section 30-2028, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(Code 1982, § 904.04(1)) 
Sec. 30-1983. - Certificate of zoning compliance. 
    The building and zoning administrator shall issue a certificate of zoning compliance for each activity requiring a permit as specified in section 30-1982. This certificate will specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this division. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized by the permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and shall be punishable as provided in section 30-1968. 
(Code 1982, § 904.04(2)) 
Sec. 30-1984. - Variances. 
(a)  Authorized; criteria for granting. Variances may be considered for deviations from the strict application of the standards set forth in this division. Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minn. Stats. ch. 462, as applicable. A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of this division. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. Variances may be granted subject to the findings and standards as required by subdivision II of division 2 of this article. Additionally, when considering a variance request in shoreland areas, the board of adjustments shall also consider the following: 
(1)  Whether the property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance; 
(2)  Whether the property is used seasonally or yearround; 
(3)  Whether the variance is being requested solely on the basis of economic considerations; and 
(4)  The characteristics of development on adjacent properties. 
(b)  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems. Additional standards for nonconforming sewage treatment systems are as follows: 
(1)  For existing developments, the application for a variance shall clearly demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property. 
(2)  The variance, if issued, shall require reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system. 
(c)  Action by board of adjustments. The board of adjustments shall hear and decide requests for variances in accordance with the rules that it has adopted for the conduct of business. When a variance is approved after the state department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the approved variance required in section 30-1985(b) shall also include the board of adjustment's summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance. 
(Code 1982, § 904.04(3)) 
Sec. 30-1985. - Notifications to commissioner. 
(a)  Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments, or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls shall be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats shall include copies of the subdivisions/plats. 
(b)  A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats and final decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls shall be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action. 
(Code 1982, § 904.04(4)) 
Sec. 30-1986. - Nonconformities. 
    All legally established nonconformities as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may continue, but they will be managed according to applicable state statutes and other regulations of the city for the subjects of alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of use; except that the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas: 
(1)  Construction on nonconforming lots of record. 
a.  Lots of record in the office of the county recorder on the date of enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements of subdivision IV of this division may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became substandard, the lot was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this division are met. 
b.  If setback requirements cannot be met, a variance shall be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the board of adjustments shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided. 
c.  If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of section 30-2021, the lot shall not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot shall be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of section 30-2021 as much as possible. 
(2)  Additions or expansions to nonconforming structures. 
a.  All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure shall meet the setback, height, and other requirements of subdivision IV of this division. Any deviation from these requirements shall be authorized by a variance pursuant to section 30-1984. 
b.  Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high-water level if all of the following criteria and standards are met: 
1.  The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established; 
2.  A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high-water level setback of the structure; 
3.  The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high-water level does not exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high-water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive; and 
4.  The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screened. 
(3)  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems. A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of section 30-2028 shall be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high-water level.

_____ 
One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet from the ordinary high-water level. 
(2)  Additional structure setbacks. The following additional structure setbacks apply, regardless of the classification of the water body: 
a.  Setback from top of bluff: 30 feet. 
b.  Setback from unplatted cemetery; 50 feet. 
(3)  Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, shall not be placed within bluff impact zones. 
(4)  Uses without water-oriented needs. Commercial, industrial, public and semipublic uses without water-oriented needs shall be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, shall either be set back double the normal ordinary high-water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(b)  Design criteria for structures. 
(1)  Flood protection elevations. Structures shall be placed in accordance with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or floodproofed shall be determined as follows: 
a.  For lakes, the elevation shall be determined by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high-water level, whichever is higher. 
b.  For rivers and streams, the elevation shall be determined by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the highest known water level. 
c.  Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined pursuant to this subsection (b)(1) if the structure is constructed of flood resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris. 
(2)  Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in subsection (a) of this section if this water-oriented accessory structure complies with the following provisions: 
a.  The structure or facility shall not exceed ten feet in height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet. Detached decks shall not exceed eight feet above grade at any point. 
b.  The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high-water level shall be at least ten feet. 
c.  The structure or facility shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
d.  The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but shall not be enclosed or used as a storage area. 
e.  The structure or facility shall not be designed or used for human habitation and shall not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities. 
f.  As an alternative for general development water bodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage, including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline. 
(3)  Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore area. If stairways, lifts, and landings meet the following design requirements they shall not be considered a water-oriented accessory structure; however, they may be required to receive a building permit: 
a.  Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public open space recreational properties, and planned unit developments; 
b.  Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots shall not exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for commercial properties, public open space recreational properties, and planned unit developments; 
c.  Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings; 
d.  Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion; 
e.  Stairways, lifts, and landings shall be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and 
f.  Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subsections (b)(3)a through e of this section are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations chapter 1340. 
(4)  Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a public repository.

(2)  The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high-water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites. 
(e)  Residential PUD density evaluation. The procedures for determining the base density of a residential PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows: 
(1)  Residential PUD base density evaluation. 
a.  The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit development are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses in this section and the design criteria in subsection (e)(2) of this section. 
b.  A determination is made as to whether the project is eligible for any density increases. To be eligible, projects shall meet all of the design standards in subsection (e)(2) of this section and exceed one or more of them. The city may decide how much, if any, increase in density to allow for each tier, but shall not exceed the maximum allowable density increases listed in the following table:

To be eligible, projects shall meet all of the design standards in subsection (f)(2) of this section and exceed one or more of them. The city may decide how much, if any, increase in density to allow for each tier, but shall not exceed the maximum allowable density increases listed in the following table: 
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DWELLING UNIT OR SITE DENSITY INCREASES FOR COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 
Tier Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier 
(percent) First  50 Second 100 Third 200 Fourth 200 Fifth 200  
f.  Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the shoreland lake or river, but shall not be transferred to any other tier closer. 
(2)  Design criteria. The design criteria are as follows: 
a.  Commercial planned unit developments shall contain open space meeting all of the following criteria: 
1.  At least 50 percent of the total project area shall be preserved as open space. 
2.  Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces or parking areas, except water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the computation of open space. 
3.  Open space shall include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries. 
4.  All shore impact zones within commercial planned unit developments shall be included as open space, and at least 50 percent of these areas shall be preserved in their natural or existing state. 
5.  Open space may include outdoor recreation facilities for use by guests staying in dwelling units or sites, or the public. 
6.  Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems. 
b.  Design of structures and facilities shall be done according to the following standards: 
1.  Commercial planned unit developments shall be connected to publicly owned water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems shall be designed and installed to meet or exceed the requirements of Sherburne County Zoning Ordinance, section 17.5 "Subsurface Sewage Treatment System Program," and sections 30-2022 and 30-2028. On-site sewage treatment systems shall be located on the most suitable areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors shall be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage system. 
2.  Dwelling units or sites shall be located on suitable areas of the development. They shall be designed and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high-water level, elevation above surface water features, and maximum height. Maximum density increases may only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high-water level are increased to at least 50 percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography or other means acceptable to the city and the setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum setback. 
3.  Structures, parking areas, and other facilities shall be designed and located in a manner that minimizes their visibility from surface water features, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. The structure, dwelling unit, accessory structure, or parking area shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the city, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening shall be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided. 
4.  Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be located within shore impact zones if they meet or exceed design standards contained in section 30-2022. 
5.  Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, shall be centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability shall include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number of watercraft allowed to be continuously beached, moored, or docked shall not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier, notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing harbor. Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers. 
c.  Erosion control and stormwater management facilities for commercial planned unit developments shall: 
1.  Be designed, and their construction managed, to minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This shall be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques shall be used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans approved by the soil and water conservation district may be required if project size and site physical characteristics warrant. 
2.  Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier shall not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that 35 percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and consistency with section 30-2023.

Sec. 30-2073. - Purpose of division. 
    The uncontrolled use of shorelands along the Mississippi River in the city affects the public health, safety, and general welfare, not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to protect and preserve the outstanding scenic, recreational, natural, historical, and scientific values of the Mississippi River. The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use, and conservation of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and protect existing natural, scenic, historical, scientific, and recreational values, reduce the effects of overcrowding and poorly planned development of adjacent lands, prevent pollution, preserve natural beauty and quietude, maintain proper relationships between various land use types, and prohibit new uses that are inconsistent with the statewide standards and criteria. The city hereby recognizes this responsibility.

ARTICLE VIII. - OFFICIAL MAPS 

Sec. 30-2201. - Purpose. 
    Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to non-public uses which could have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the purpose of this article to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official maps as authorized by the Minnesota Municipal Planning Act, Minn. Stats. §§ 462.351 to 462.365. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2202. - Official map defined. 
    Official map as used in this article means a map adopted in accordance with this article showing existing streets, proposed future streets, and the area needed for widening or existing streets of the city. An official map may also show the location of existing and future land and facilities within the city. An official map may cover the entire city or any portion of the city. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2203. - Initiation of proceedings. 
    Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by: 
(1)  The city's planning department; 
(2)  A recommendation of the planning commission; or 
(3)  Action by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2204. - Reference to planning commission. 
    Every proposed official map or change in a map shall be referred to the planning commission for advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the city council within 45 days after reference to the planning commission along with the report of the commission on the effect of the proposal on the comprehensive plan of the city. If no recommendation is received by the council from the planning commission within 45 days after reference of the proposal to the commission by the council, the council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without further action by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2205. - Notice and hearing. 
(a)  Notice. Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission or after 45 days from the submission of the proposal to the planning commission without a recommendation from the commission, the council may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At least ten days prior to the hearing the clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice the owners shall be determined by the records of the county auditor and the notice shall be addressed to the last known address as shown by the auditor's records. Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings. 
(b)  Hearing. At the time and place specified in the notice, the council shall hear evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be continued from time to time without further notice. The council may direct the planning commission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to report its recommendation to the council. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2206. - Preparation and filing of maps. 
    The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline survey shall be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. The accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the official map shall be attested to by a licensed land surveyor. After enactment of any ordinance adopting an official map or amending or repealing a previous official map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to which the ordinance relates together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the county recorder. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2207. - Effect. 
    After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the city shall be subject to the provisions of this article. The city shall deny every application for a permit to construct a new building or structure or expand an existing building or structure within any area designated on the official map for street or other public purposes, or within required setback from mapped streets. Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the city, the city is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give the city any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the city to acquire such interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit. 
(Ord. No. 14-20, § 1, 12-15-2014) 
Sec. 30-2208. - Appeals. 
    Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this article, the board of appeals and adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, grant a permit for building in an area designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it, (a) that the entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such a permit is granted, or (b) that balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive city plan and the interest of the property owner in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity. The board of appeals and adjustments shall hold a public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official newspaper once at least ten days before the hearing. If the board authorizes the issuance of a permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area, height, and other details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit is granted. If the board authorizes issuance of a permit, the council or other board or commission having jurisdiction shall have six months from the date of the decision of the board to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started within that time, the city shall issue the permit if the application otherwise conforms to local ordinances.

(d)  Procedure for suspension or revocation. Except where a different procedure is provided by a particular ordinance or state law, the following procedure shall apply to suspensions and revocations of licenses under this section:

c.  A statement that within 30 days after receipt of the notice the licensee may demand in writing a hearing before the city council and that such demand shall be delivered to the city clerk. 
d.  A statement that failure to request a hearing shall be cause for automatic suspension or revocation of the license. 
If the notice described in this subsection (1) states corrections required by the city, the notice shall also state that failure to comply with such corrections within ten days of receipt of the notice shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license. 
(2)  Request for hearing. If the licensee wishes to have a hearing on the subject of the proposed suspension or revocation of the license, such licensee must demand such a hearing in writing within 30 days of receipt of the notice described in subsection (1) of this subsection.

If, after the hearing, the council determines that proper grounds exist to suspend or revoke the license in question, the council shall state those grounds for the record and suspend or revoke such license. No suspension shall be for longer than 60 days. Suspension or revocation shall not prejudice the city's right to bring criminal charges in connection with the same case. 
(e)  Summary action. When the conduct of any license holder or his agent, employee, representative or lessee is so inimical to the public health, safety or general welfare as to constitute a nuisance and thus give rise to an emergency, the city clerk shall have authority to summarily order the cessation of business and the closing of the premises or to suspend or revoke the license subject to the following: 
(1)  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the city clerk to cease business or to suspend or revoke the license shall be entitled to appeal by requesting in writing a hearing before the council within 30 days of the date of such decision by delivery of such request to the city clerk.

Sec. 38-292. - Purpose of article. 
    The city council finds that pawnbrokers potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The purpose of this article is therefore to prevent pawnbroking from being used as facilities for commission of crimes and to ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
    To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this article also implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS).

ARTICLE III. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 46-80. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council of the city is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. 
(b)  The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Graffiti perpetrators are often associated with other criminal activities, including violent crimes. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
(c)  The city council intends, through the adoption of this article, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement of public and private property. The council does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti state laws or "criminal damage to property" laws.

ARTICLE V. - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES FOR CODE VIOLATIONS[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, adopted September 15, 2008, enacted provisions intended for use as §§ 50-200-50-217. At the editors' discretion, these provisions have been included herein as §§ 50-201-50-218. 

Sec. 50-201. - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing the code of ordinances. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanisms, there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the public. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative violations. The criminal process does not always regard city code violations as important. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy which may be pursued for city code violations. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-202. - Administrative offenses. 
    A violation of any provision of the city code is an administrative offense, which may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties pursuant to this article. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-203. - Civil penalties. 
    An administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $2,000.00 per day. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-204. - Schedule of fines. 
    The city council may adopt by ordinance a schedule of recommended fines for offenses initiated by administration citation. The city council is not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for administrative review. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-205. - Procedures. 
    The city may adopt written procedures for administering the administrative citation program. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-206. - Administrative citation. 
    A person authorized to enforce provisions of the city code may issue an administrative citation upon belief that a code violation has occurred. The citation must be issued in person or by first class mail to the person responsible for the violation, or attached to the motor vehicle in the case of a vehicular offense. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the identity of the person issuing the citation, the amount of the scheduled fine, and the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-207. - Response to citation. 
    The person responsible for the violation must either pay the scheduled fine or request a hearing within seven days after issuance of the citation. Payment of the fine constitutes admission of the violation. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-208. - Administrative hearing board. 
    The city council shall appoint a three-member administrative hearing board to hear appeals from administrative citations. The administrative hearing board shall consist of two city council members and one planning commissioner, who shall be recommended for appointment by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-209. - Administrative subpoenas. 
    Upon the hearing board's own initiative, or upon written request of an interested party demonstrating the need, the board may issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records, or other documents that are material to the matter being heard. The party requesting the subpoena is responsible for serving the subpoena in the manner provided for civil actions and for paying the fees and expenses of any witness. A person served with a subpoena may file an objection with the hearing board promptly but no later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The board may cancel or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive. A person who, without just cause, fails or refuses to attend and testify or to produce the required documents in obedience to a subpoena is guilty of a misdemeanor. Alternatively, the party requesting the subpoena may seek an order from district court directing compliance. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-210. - Notice of administrative hearing. 
    Administrative hearings shall be scheduled by the city administrator at a time that is convenient for the hearing board members. Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by mail on the person responsible for the violation at least ten days in advance, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-211. - Conduct of administrative hearing. 
    At the hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence do not apply. The hearing board must record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits. The board must receive and give weight to evidence, including reliable hearsay evidence, which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-212. - Decision and penalties. 
(a)  The hearing board has the authority to determine that a violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine, and to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon compliance with appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing board may consider any or all of the following factors: 
(1)  The duration of the violation; 
(2)  The frequency or recurrence of the violation; 
(3)  The seriousness of the violation; 
(4)  The history of the violation; 
(5)  The violator's conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing; 
(6)  The good faith effort by the violator to comply; 
(7)  The economic impact of the penalty on the violator; 
(8)  The impact of the violation upon the community; and 
(9)  Any other factors appropriate to a just result. 
(b)  The hearing board may exercise its discretion to impose a fine for more than one day of a continuing violation, but only upon a finding that the violation caused a serious threat of harm to the public health, safety, or welfare or that the accused intentionally and unreasonably refused to comply with the code requirement. The hearing board's decision and supporting reasons must be in writing. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-213. - Failure to comply or appeal. 
    Failure to pay the administrative penalty identified in a citation, or to request a hearing within seven days after the citation, or failure to attend the hearing, constitutes a waiver of the violator's rights to an administrative hearing and is an admission of the violation. A hearing board may waive this result upon good cause shown. Examples of "good cause": death or incapacitating illness of the accused; a court order requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing. "Good cause" does not include forgetfulness and intentional delay. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-214. - Appeal to city council. 
(a)  Any decision of the hearing board may be appealed to the city council by submitting a request in writing to the city administrator within seven days after the hearing board's decision. 
(b)  The appeal must be heard by the city council after notice served in person or by registered mail at least ten days in advance. The parties to the hearing must have an opportunity to present oral or written arguments regarding the hearing board's decision. 
(c)  The city council must consider the record, the hearing board's decision, and any additional arguments before making a determination. The council is not bound by the hearing board's decision, but may adopt all or part of the board's decision. The council's decision must be in writing. 
(d)  If the council makes a finding of a violation, it may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $2,000.00 per day per violation and may consider any or all of the factors contained in section 50-212. The council may also reduce, stay, or waive a fine unconditionally or based on reasonable and appropriate conditions. 
(e)  In addition to imposing a civil penalty, the council may suspend or revoke any city-issued license, permit, or other approval associated with the violation, if the procedures in the city code have been followed. Any hearing required in the city code for such suspension or revocation is deemed satisfied by the hearing before the hearing board with the right of appeal to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-215. - Judicial review. 
    An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the decision of the hearing board or the city council in accordance with state law. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-216. - Recovery of civil penalties. 
(a)  If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it constitutes: 
(1)  A personal obligation of the violator; and 
(2)  A lien upon the real property upon which the violation occurred if the property or improvements on the property were the subject of the violation and the property owner was found responsible for that violation. 
(b)  A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the same manner as taxes. 
(c)  A personal obligation may be collected by any appropriate legal means. 
(d)  A late payment fee of ten percent of the fine will be assessed for each 30-day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the due date. 
(e)  During the time that a civil penalty remains unpaid, no city approval will be granted for a license, permit, or other city approval sought by the violator or for property under the violator's ownership or control. 
(f)  Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending, revoking, denying, or not renewing a license or permit associated with the violation. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-217. - Criminal penalties. 
    The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance with state law: 
(1)  Failure, without good cause, to pay a fine or request a hearing within 30 days after issuance of an administrative citation. 
(2)  Failure, without good cause, to appear at a hearing which was scheduled under section 50-210. 
(3)  Failure to pay a fine imposed by a hearing board within 30 days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the hearing board, unless the matter is appealed under section 50-214. 
(4)  Failure to pay a fine imposed by the city council within 30 days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 08-10, § 1, 9-15-2008) 
Sec. 50-218. - Applicable laws. 
    Where differences occur between provisions of this article and other applicable code sections, this article applies.

(1)  The violation of any material provision of the street disruption permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the street disruption permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;

(b)  Notice. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated in this section, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. The permittee's failure to so contact the city, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

Grid lines and existing blocks, as shown on the house numbering map established under section 66-143, shall indicate where numbering changes from one "hundred" to the next higher "hundred." 
(d)  Each principal building shall bear the number assigned to the frontage on which the main front entrance is located.

The building and zoning administrator shall cause the numbers so designated to be placed on the house numbering map in such manner as to conform with the provisions of this article and shall further cause any existing nonconforming numbers to be removed. 
(b)  Such numbers shall be placed on existing buildings within 20 days after the assigning of the proper numbers. Such numbers, which shall be paid for by the owner of the building or his agent, may be obtained from the city administrator at such price as shall be established by the city from time to time, or from any other source offering suitable numbers for such purpose. Numbers shall not be less than three inches in height and shall be made of a durable and readily visible material. Numbers shall be placed immediately above, on or at the side of the proper door so as to be clearly visible from the street line. For a building set back more than 50 feet from the street property line, such numbers may be placed near the walk, driveway or entranceway to such building, upon a post, fence, tree or other suitable place, so as to be clearly visible from the street line. 
(c)  No building permit shall be issued for any building until the owner or his agent has first secured the assigned number for such building. Final approval of any building erected, repaired, altered, enlarged or moved shall be withheld by the building and zoning administrator until assigned numbers have been placed upon the building as required by this article.

Sec. 78-1. - Finding of public health and safety hazard. 
(a)  The city council finds that failure to connect to the city water system as required by section 78-21 of this Code, failure to connect to the city sewer and sewage disposal system as required by subsection 78-97(d) of this Code, and failure to maintain in good, operable condition private water and sanitary sewer utility lines, creates public health and safety hazards on private property which must be eliminated. 
(b)  In addition to the provisions of section 78-22 and subsection 78-97(d), which authorize the city to make connections to the city water and sanitary sewer systems and to assess the costs therefore to the affected property, and the provisions of Sherburne County Zoning Ordinance [section] 17.5 and chapter 46, article II of this Code, which declares defective sewage systems and plumbing a nuisance affecting the public's safety and health and authorizes the city to abate such nuisances and to assess the costs therefor to the affected properties, the city council finds that it is necessary and in the public interest to provide a mechanism for costs incurred by private property owners to eliminate such public health and safety hazards on private property to be assessed against the property as a special assessment. 
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 1, 4-2-2012; Ord. No. 12-17, § 1, 12-10-2012; Ord. No. 15-07, § 1, 2-17-2015) 
Sec. 78-2. - Petition authorized.

If the stop-off valve cannot be located and the property needs to be entered to shut off the water, ERMU personnel will contact the Elk River Police Department for assistance in entering the property and ERMU will attempt to get a locksmith to enter the property. If it is necessary to force entry, ERMU personnel will do so only with the Elk River Police Department's assistance. Neither ERMU, nor the City of Elk River, nor any employee or contractor employed by ERMU or the city, shall be liable to the property owner or other person or entity for any damage to the property as a result of the need to force entry into the property. A notice will be mailed and posted on any property where water has been shut off without prior written notice advising that the owner or occupant may request a post shut-off hearing to contest the shut-off.

Sec. 78-154. - Restricted discharges. 
    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, directly or indirectly, the following described substances to any public sewer, unless, in the opinion of the city, such discharge will not harm the wastewater treatment works or cause obstruction to the flow in sewers or otherwise endanger life, limb or public property or constitute a nuisance. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the city may give consideration to such factors as the quantities of the subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, the nature of construction of the sewers, the nature of the sewage treatment process, the capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, the city's NPDES permit, and other pertinent factors. The city may make such determination on a general basis or as to the discharges from individual users or specific discharges, and may prohibit certain discharges from individual users because of unusual concentrations or combinations which may occur. The substances prohibited are: 
(1)  Any wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), or causing individually, or in combination with other wastewater, the influent at the wastewater treatment plant to have a temperature exceeding 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), or having heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the wastewater treatment works resulting in interference therein. 
(2)  Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter, or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees and 65 degrees Celsius, respectively), and any wastewater containing oil and grease concentrations of mineral origin of greater than 100 milligrams per liter, whether emulsified or not. 
(3)  Any garbage that has not been ground or otherwise reduced to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely in suspension under flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension. 
(4)  Any water or waste containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or concentrated plating solutions, which is not neutralized and does not meet applicable pretreatment standards. If national categorical pretreatment standards do not apply, the discharge equality shall comply with 40 CFR part 433 (metal finishing standards). 
(5)  Any noxious water or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances which constitute a nuisance or hazard to the structures, equipment or personnel of the waste treatment works, or which interfere with treatment required to meet the requirements of the state and federal government and any other public agency with proper authority to regulate discharge from the sewage treatment plant. 
(6)  Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such halflife or concentration that they are in noncompliance with regulations issued by the appropriate authority having control over their use or which have caused or may have caused damage or hazard to the treatment works or personnel operating it. 
(7)  Any water or waste outside the pH range of 5.0 to 10.5. This range will allow adequate flexibility for industrial users. A higher pH than 8.5 but less than 10.5 will not cause treatment or sewer compatibility problems and in many cases will allow industrial users to better treat wastewater containing metals prior to discharge. Potable water supplies often exceed a pH of 8.5. 
(8)  Any noncontact cooling water or unpolluted stormwater, drainage water or groundwater. 
(9)  Any waters or wastes containing the following substances: arsenic, cadmium, copper, cyanide, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, total chromium, zinc or phenolic compounds, to a degree that the materials received prevent adequate treatment of the waste. 
(10)  Materials which exert or cause: 
a.  Unusual concentrations of suspended solids, such as, but not limited to, Fuller's earth, lime slurry and lime residues, or of dissolved solids, such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. 
b.  Excessive discoloration, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
c.  Unusual BOD, COD or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment works. 
d.  Unusual volumes of flow or concentrations of wastes constituting a slug. 
(11)  Water or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employees, or are amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of the NPDES permit or requirements of other governmental agencies having jurisdiction over discharge from the sewage treatment plant.

(Code 1982, § 1300.02(9)) 
Sec. 78-156. - Fats, oils and grease (FOG) control. 
(a)  FOG program participation required. 
(1)  This section applies to all "food service establishments" (FSE) and "food manufacturer/processors" (FM/P) discharging wastewater containing fats, oils and grease to the City of Elk River Sanitary Sewer System including, but not limited to, restaurants, grocery stores, meat markets, hotels, correctional facilities, factory and office building cafeterias, public and private schools, hospitals, multiple tenant housing, commercial day care centers, churches, and catering services. 
(2)  As of the effective date of this ordinance [from which this section derives] and thereafter, no FSE or FM/P shall discharge any substance of any kind into any portion of the City of Elk River's wastewater system except in accordance with a best management practice (BMP) program which has been approved by the city wastewater treatment plant chief operator in writing. 
(3)  The city shall, from time to time, establish by resolution the minimum standards for the content of a BMP program. 
(4)  No FSE or FM/P shall discharge any substance of any kind into any portion of the wastewater facility which is not in conformance with the BMP program for that FSE or FM/P. 
(b)  FOG prohibitions. The following prohibitions apply to all FSE or FM/Ps: 
(1)  Installation of food grinders in a plumbing or sewage system in any new construction or renovation of a structure designed to house a FSE or FM/P; 
(2)  Discharge any wastewater containing FOG into a wastewater facility except in compliance with the BMP program for that facility; 
(3)  Introduction of any additives into the wastewater system for the purpose of emulsifying FOG or biologically or chemically treating any substance introduced into any wastewater facility for purpose of treatment or pretreatment of wastewater, unless a specific written authorization by the chief operator is obtained; 
(4)  Discharge of wastewater from dishwashers to any grease interceptor or grease trap; 
(5)  Discharge of wastewater at temperatures in excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit to any grease interceptor or grease trap; 
(6)  Operation of grease interceptors if the unit has accumulated waste, both FOG and food solids, accounting for 25 percent or more of its wetted depth measured from the static water level to the interior tank bottom, with FOG and solids accumulation, exceeding 25 percent of the total operating depth of the grease interceptor; or 
(7)  Discharge of any FOG or any other solid materials removed from the grease control device to the wastewater system. 
(c)  FOG interceptors installation requirements. 
(1)  Except as provided for in subsection (l) below, any structure designed for or intended to be used for an FSE or FM/P must have a grease interceptor installed prior to discharging any wastewater into a wastewater system. Such grease interceptor must comply with all conditions as set forth in the State of Minnesota Administrative Code, Section 4715.1115, Exterior Grease Interceptors; 
(2)  Property owners of new commercial construction structure designed to house multiple tenants on a single parcel shall be responsible to install and maintain a single grease interceptor to serve each individual tenant unless a property owner demonstrates to the chief operator that it is not practically possible to install and maintain a single grease interceptor to serve each individual unit located in the structure in which case the chief operator has the discretion to approve a plan for such structure providing for more than one grease interceptor or a combination of grease interceptors and grease traps to service such property, which approval shall be in writing. Said approved plan shall include the minimum number of grease interceptors and grease traps that can reasonably serve the structure and the BMP program shall specifically include service for all approved grease intercepts and grease traps; 
(3)  The owner of any structure occupied by more than one FSE or FM/P (strip malls) shall be jointly and severally liable with the owner of each FSE or FM/P served by any grease interceptor or any grease trap for the servicing and maintenance of that grease interceptor or grease trap and for any servicing and maintenance of any wastewater facility located downstream from said structure to remove any accumulations of FOG therefrom; 
(4)  The chief operator may require existing FSE or FM/Ps and owners of structures in which such FSE or FM/Ps are located which have been identified as introducing FOG in any portion of the wastewater system, and which introduction of FOG, in whole or in combination with other FOG contributors, has been responsible for causing the need for the city to clean such portion of the wastewater system more than twice in a single calendar year to install grease interceptors or other FOG equipment as deemed necessary to comply with this section. Such installation shall be completed and operational within 180 days of notice by the chief operator. 
(d)  Maintenance and cleaning of grease interceptors. In the maintaining and routine cleaning of grease interceptors and any other grease control device, the owner of the FSE or FM/P and the owner of the structure in which it is located, if different from the owner of the FSE or FM/P shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material. If not performed by personnel under the direct control and direction of any such owner, such removal and haul shall be performed by currently licensed waste disposal haulers. 
The 25-percent rule requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and settled) in a trap shall be less than 25 percent of the total operating depth of the trap. The operating depth of a trap is determined by measuring the internal depth from the outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap. 
(e)  Outdoor grease traps. Maintenance of outdoor grease traps shall be performed as frequently as necessary to protect the sanitary sewer system against the accumulation of FOG. Maintenance shall be performed as determined by inspection and application of the 25-percent rule, or at intervals specified in the permit, whichever is more frequent. Maintenance shall be performed at least every 90 days. 
(f)  Indoor grease interceptors. Maintenance of indoor grease interceptors shall be performed as frequently as necessary to protect the sanitary sewer system against the accumulation of FOG. Maintenance shall be performed as required by inspection and/or sampling or at intervals specified in the permit, whichever is more frequent. Maintenance shall be performed at least every 14 days. 
(g)  [Maintenance process.] Maintenance process shall include the following minimum services: 
(1)  Complete removal of all grease interceptor or trap contents rather than skimming the top grease layer; 
(2)  Thorough cleaning of the grease interceptor or trap to remove grease and scum from inner walls and baffles; 
(3)  Filling cleaned interceptor or trap with cold potable water; and 
(4)  Completed waste hauler's section of the grease disposal manifest form and delivery to waste disposal site along with the grease interceptor or trap waste. 
(5)  Top skimming, decanting or back flushing of the grease interceptor or trap or its contents for the purpose of reducing the volume of waste to be hauled is prohibited. Vehicles capable of separating water from grease shall not discharge separated water into the grease trap or into the wastewater collection system. 
(h)  Maintenance modifications. Food service facilities which operate infrequently or only for special events may request a modification to the maintenance schedule specified above. The wastewater treatment plant chief operator may authorize a maintenance frequency related to the operation of the food service facility. The user shall submit a request for a modified maintenance schedule which includes all details of operation for the director to review. 
(i)  Disposal. The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal of the grease interceptor or trap waste. All waste removed from each grease interceptor or trap must be disposed of properly at an appropriate facility designed to receive grease interceptor or trap waste. No grease interceptor or trap waste shall be discharged into any City of Elk River sanitary or storm sewer system. 
(j)  Maintenance log. The user shall be responsible for retaining records of the maintenance of grease interceptors and traps including manifests, permits, permit applications, correspondence, sampling data and any other documentation that may be requested by the City of Elk River. This log shall include the dates of service, volume of waste removed, waste hauler, and disposal site of waste. These records shall be kept on-site at the location of the grease interceptor or trap for a period of three years and are subject to review without prior notification. 
(k)  Submittal of records. Each user shall submit all cleaning and maintenance records to the WWTP chief operator. The maintenance records shall include the following information: 
(1)  Facility name, address, contact person, and phone number. 
(2)  Company name, address, phone number, and contact name of person responsible for performing the maintenance, cleaning, pumping, or repair of grease trap. 
(3)  Types of maintenance performed. 
(4)  Dates maintenance was performed. 
(5)  Date of next scheduled maintenance. 
(6)  Copies of manifests. 
The user shall be required to submit maintenance records to the WWTP bi-annually (July 1 and December 31) to: 
City of Elk River 
Attn. Chief Operator, WWTP 
248 Railroad Drive 
Elk River, MN 55330 
The WWTP will perform periodic inspections of these facilities and shall notify the user of any additional required maintenance or repairs. Upon written notification by the WWTP, the user shall be required to perform the maintenance and records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. 
Upon inspection by the WWTP the user may be required to install, at his expense, additional controls to provide a complete system which prevents discharges of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system. 
(l)  Exception from grease interceptor requirements. If the owner of any FSE or FM/P or of any structure in which an FSE or FM/P is located or is to be located demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the chief operator that installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible, the chief operator may grant an exception allowing such owner to install grease traps or other alternative treatment technology which will in his or her discretion adequately control the release of FOG from the FSE or FM/P or the structure into the wastewater system. The FSE or FM/P bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The request for an exemption shall include the following information if relevant: 
(1)  Evidence of a lack of available exterior space necessary to place an interceptor relative to the location of sewer main and easement; 
(2)  Evidence of a lack of adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures in the FSE or FM/P and the wastewater facilities; 
(3)  Description and specifications of the alternative grease control equipment that will be installed; 
(4)  Evidence that the size, available seating or type of food preparation does not generate any significant volume of FOG. 
(m)  Charge for remedial maintenance or repair of the city wastewater system. 
(1)  In the event that the owner of an FSE or FM/P or the owner of any structure in which an FSE or FM/P is located is found to have contributed to the partial or complete obstruction of a wastewater facility resulting from the discharge of wastewater or waste containing FOG and that the city is required to act immediately to control a public health hazard because of such blockage, such owner shall be required to reimburse the city for all costs of abating such condition. In situations where there are multiple owners identified as contributing to FOG causing such obstruction, the chief operator will apportion the cost of the cleanup, maintenance or repair costs on a prorated basis, based on each owner's percentage share of the average total sanitary sewer charges for all such owners. Further should inspection, testing or other sampling activity by the city confirm that any user is contributing excessive FOG (including other harmful ingredients) and is causing the repair or extraordinary maintenance activity to maintain the integrity of the system, the chief operator may require retrofitting of the structure with grease interceptors or grease traps, including testing facilities and access thereto sufficient to resolve the problem; 
(2)  The costs for curing any private sewer lateral failures and sewer system overflows, including cleaning and other maintenance, caused in whole or in part by FOG introduced into the wastewater treatment facilities by any FSE or FM/P, alone or in conjunction with any other party, are the responsibility of the owner of the FSE or FM/P and the owner of any structure in which the FSE or FM/P contributing the FOG to wastewater system is located. 
(n)  Compliance. 
(1)  Compliance with the grease control program shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 
(2)  All food service establishments who are implementing and documenting BMPs [including employee training and kitchen procedures] and performing and documenting grease retention unit cleaning at the required frequency will be considered to be in full compliance with this policy. 
(3)  When an obstruction and/or sanitary sewer overflow occur, the records of all FSE or FM/P that discharge to the affected sanitary sewer line may be reviewed in order to determine the responsible party. Any FSE or FM/P found to be in noncompliance with the required grease retention unit cleaning frequency shall be deemed a "responsible party" for cost recovery. Payment of cost recovery does not preclude further enforcement actions for noncompliance as per the FOG enforcement response plan. 
(o)  Penalties and assessments for FOG program noncompliance. In the event that the owner of an FSE or FM/P or the owner of any structure in which an FSE or FM/P is located is found to have failed to comply with the provisions of this division, the following penalties or assessments or both may be applied: 
(1)  For introduction of FOG into any wastewater facility resulting in obstruction to said facility or in an SSO: 
a.  The city may disconnect water and sewer service to the FSE or FM/P and to the structure in which the FSE or FM/P is located; 
b.  City may impose a fine per the City of Elk River's Enforcement Response Plan each month until such owner demonstrates that the subject FSE or FM/P or structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section; 
(2)  For failure to maintain records as required by the BMP program for any FSE or FM/P, or failing or refusing to timely comply with any request for records required to be provided to the chief operator, a fine per the City of Elk River's Enforcement Response Plan each day until such records are provided; 
(3)  For failure to pass the FOG inspection due to lack of or ineffective FOG equipment the chief operator may: 
a.  Require the subject FSE or FM/P to install additional FOG equipment as necessary to resolve the problem; 
b.  Change the sewer rate class of the FSE or FM/P to reflect the presence of the excessive FOG contribution by the FSE or FM/P.

The number, type and frequency of sampling and laboratory analysis to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to ensure that compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analysis to the city at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analysis and reporting required by the city. At such time as deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an independent laboratory and charge the owner for such services. 
(Code 1982, § 1300.02(14)) 
Sec. 78-161. - Accidental discharges. 
    Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. Users shall notify the city immediately upon having a slug or accidental discharge of substances of wastewater in violation of this division to enable countermeasures to be taken by the city to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve any user of any liability for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under any state and federal law. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(Code 1982, § 1302.04) 
Sec. 78-187. - Determination of billable flow, loading and user charge. 
(a)  Basis. Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs in proportion to the user's proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD and TSS being the rate established for a concentration of 200 milligrams per liter BOD and 250 milligrams per liter TSS (i.e., normal domestic strength wastewater). Those industrial users discharging segregated normal domestic strength wastewater only can be classified as commercial users for the purpose of rate determination. 
(b)  User charges for normal domestic strength users. 
(1)  Calculation of billable flows and loadings. The charges assessed domestic users and those of other classes connected to the city's water utility and discharging normal domestic strength wastewater shall be established proportionately according to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  Measurement of wastewater volume for domestic users. 
1.  Domestic users connected to city water utility. Except as provided for in this division, billable wastewater volume for residential users shall be calculated on the basis of metered water usage. Metered water usage shall be determined by calculat 
ing a monthly average based on water consumption for the months of November, December, January, February and March. Usage in excess of the minimum rate will be billed on a unit cost of 1,000 gallons per month. 
2.  Domestic users not connected to city water utility. The charges assessed to residential users who are not connected to the city's water utility shall be established as a flat rate per month based on the average water use of metered residential users in the community. The city reserves the right to require residential users to install water meters for the purpose of determining billable wastewater volume. 
b.  Measurement of wastewater volume for nondomestic users. The charges assessed nondomestic users discharging normal domestic strength wastewater shall be established proportionately according to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows: The billable wastewater volume of nondomestic users may be determined in the same manner as for residential users connected to the city's water utility, except that if the city determines that there are significant seasonal variations in the metered water usage of nonresidential users resulting in a proportionate increase or decrease in wastewater volume, then billable wastewater volume shall be calculated on the basis of monthly metered water usage recorded throughout the year, or calculated on the basis of wastewater flow meters. The city may, at its discretion, require nondomestic users to install, at the user's expense, a water meter, or such additional water meters or wastewater flow meters as may be necessary to determine billable wastewater volume. 
c.  Determination of loadings for normal domestic strength users. The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated from the volume of metered water usage, as determined pursuant to this section, where the billable quantities will be those attributable to wastewater at a concentration of 200 milligrams per liter BOD and 250 milligrams per liter TSS (i.e., normal domestic strength wastewater). 
d.  Determination of loadings for nondomestic strength users. The city may, at its discretion, require nondomestic users to install a sewage monitoring facility. Each industrial user required by the city to install and maintain sewage monitoring facilities shall submit to the city a monthly report of daily flow and BOD on a form approved by the city. This report shall be used for billing purposes and shall be submitted prior to the 15th day of the subsequent month. The city shall have the right to periodically or continuously inspect the monitoring facilities to measure, sample and analyze the industrial user's flow and to analyze the samples obtained by such user. In the event of any discrepancy between the flows or loads determined by the city and those determined by the industrial user, the values determined by the city shall be used for billing purposes. 
(2)  Determination of user charges for normal domestic strength users. User charges for normal domestic users, except senior citizens and unmetered water users, shall be calculated on a unit charge for each 1,000 gallons. However, under no circumstance will a user be billed less than the minimum charge. Senior citizens shall be charged for the actual metered usage at the unit cost per 1,000 gallons. Unmetered users shall be charged a flat fee calculated from the average domestic usage throughout the community. The user charges for the three classifications of domestic users shall be as follows: 
a.  Metered water users. The per-month billable wastewater volume shall be an average of the metered water usage during the months of November, December, January, February, and March. 
b.  Unmetered water users. The charge shall be a flat rate per household unit. 
c.  Senior citizens. The charge shall be for the actual metered water usage (rounded to 1,000 gallons). 
(3)  Determination of user charges for nondomestic users. 
a.  Sewer service charges for users who discharge wastewater with concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of unusual character shall be calculated in proportion to the wastewater flow and loading at the treatment plant. No user shall be charged at a rate less than that of normal domestic strength wastewater. 
b.  The measurements of such wastes shall be conducted according to the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, in a manner acceptable to the city, as provided for in division 2 of this article. 
c.  A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loading shall be developed for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to flows and loadings for users discharging wastes of greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of unusual character. 
d.  In addition to the charges provided for in this section, the city may impose a surcharge on any industrial user based on some other pollutant loading factor which requires special treatment at the wastewater treatment plant.

(1)  The applicant shall consider reducing the need for stormwater management performance standards by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover. It shall also: 
a.  Minimize impact to significant natural features; 
b.  Review the site for wetlands, wooded areas of significance, rare and endangered species habitat, areas designated by the County Biological Survey (1993), and/or Elk River Natural Resource Inventory (NRI) (December 2004). These areas should not be developed; 
c.  Minimize impervious surface coverage to the maximum extent practicable; 
d.  In designated shoreland areas the development shall meet the impervious surface requirements of the shoreland ordinance regardless of conveyance systems; 
e.  Volume control. Designer shall be required to provide soil boring analysis to determine the infiltration rate prior to approval of plans. The design shall meet the following requirements depending on the type of project in accordance with the MS4 NPDES permit: 
1.  New development . For new, nonlinear developments that create more than one acre of new impervious surface on sites without restrictions, stormwater runoff volumes will be controlled and the post-construction runoff volume shall be retained on site for 1.1 inches of runoff from all impervious surfaces on the site; 
2.  Redevelopment . Redevelopment projects (including linear projects), on sites without restrictions that create new impervious surfaces shall capture and retain on site 1.1 inches of runoff from the new impervious surface and show a net pollutant reduction for any reconstructed impervious surfaces. 
f.  Water quality. 
1.  Total suspended solids . Treatment also must achieve an 80 percent removal of suspended solids. 
2.  Phosphorus control . Stormwater shall be treated to remove 60 percent of the post-development phosphorus load on an annual basis before discharge to natural water bodies. The amount of total phosphorus removed should be modeled using the minimal impact design standards (MIDS) calculator or an equivalent water quality modeling program. Where water quality ponding is exclusively used to meet the phosphorus removal requirement, the ponds must be sized to store the site runoff from a two and one-half inch rainfall below the normal outlet elevation. 
g.  Rate control. For post-construction rate control modeling a minimum curve number of 84 shall be used on all disturbed/graded soil areas, due to soil compaction impacts, unless soil protection/compaction remediation specifications have been incorporated into the proposal (plan set, stormwater management plan, etc.) and are approved by the city engineer. Atlas 14 shall be used in all rate-control estimates. 
1.  New construction . Projects shall have no increase in runoff from the predevelopment peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and 100-year 24-hour storm events. 
2.  Redevelopment . Projects shall have no increase in runoff from the pre-project peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and 100-year 24-hour storm events. 
h.  Treatment design sequencing for sites with restrictions (as found in the MIDS design sequence flowchart). 
Applicant shall fully attempt to comply with the appropriate performance goals described above. Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. If full compliance is not possible due to any of the factors listed below, the applicant must document the reason. If site constraints or restrictions limit the full treatment goal, the following treatment design sequence shall be followed: 
Applicant shall document the treatment sequence starting with alternative #1. If alternative #1 cannot be met, then alternative #2 shall be analyzed. Applicants must document the specific reasons why alternative #1 cannot be met based on the factors listed below. If alternative #2 cannot be met then alternative #3 shall be met. Applicants must document the specific reasons why alternative #2 cannot be met based on the factors listed below. When all of the conditions are fulfilled within an alternative, this sequence is completed; 
Volume reduction techniques considered shall include infiltration, reuse and rainwater harvesting, and canopy interception and evapotranspiration and/or additional techniques included in the MIDS calculator and the Minnesota Stormwater Manual; 
Higher priority shall be given to BMPs that include volume reduction. Secondary preference is to employ filtration techniques, followed by rate control BMPs. Factors to be considered for each alternative will include: 
1.  Karst geology; 
2.  Shallow bedrock; 
3.  High groundwater; 
4.  Hotspots or contaminated soils; 
5.  Drinking water source management areas or within 200 feet of drinking water well; 
6.  Zoning, setbacks or other land use requirements; 
7.  Excessive cost; 
8.  Poor soils (infiltration rates that are too low or too high, problematic urban soils). 
Alternative #1 : 
Applicant attempts to comply with the following conditions: 
1.  Achieve at least 0.55" volume reduction from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site; 
2.  Remove 75 percent of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site; 
3.  Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. 
Alternative #2 : 
Applicant attempts to comply with the following conditions: 
1.  Achieve volume reduction to the maximum extent practicable; 
2.  Remove 60 percent of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new and/or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site; 
3.  Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. 
Alternative #3 : 
Off-site treatment-Mitigation equivalent to the performance of 1.1 inches of volume reduction for new development or redevelopment as described above in this section, (including banking or cash) can be performed off-site to protect the receiving water body. Off-site treatment shall be achieved in areas selected in the following order of preference: 
1.  Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity; 
2.  Locations within the same department of natural resource (DNR) catchment area (hydrologic unit 08) as the original construction activity; 
3.  Locations within the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream; 
4.  Locations anywhere within the community's jurisdiction. 
Impervious surface area calculations shall include all disturbed/graded soil areas, due to soil compaction impacts, unless soil protection/compaction remediation specifications have been incorporated into the proposal (plan set, stormwater management plan, etc.) and are approved by the city engineer. 
Designers shall be required to provide estimates of BMP-site specific infiltration rates to the city engineer for approval prior to site plan review. For information on estimation of infiltration rates, see the Minnesota Stormwater Manual (http://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us). 
The MIDS design sequence flowchart can be found in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual: http://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Flexible_treatment_options. 
All volume control practices and site design specifications shall conform to the current version of the Minnesota Stormwater Manual. 
(2)  Stormsewer sizing . All stormwater sizing must be sized according to the City of Elk River Engineering Design Standards Manual. 
(3)  Better site design . Whenever possible, projects shall be designed using better site design techniques early in the design process to preserve natural areas, reduce impervious cover, distribute runoff and use pervious area more effectively to treat stormwater runoff. The applicant shall attempt to limit the impervious surface of the developed site or subdivision by incorporating the following design considerations, consistent with zoning, subdivision, and PUD requirements: 
a.  Open space protection and restoration. 
1.  Maximizing open space while incorporating smaller lot sizes to conserve natural areas and reduce the amount of stormwater runoff generated at the site. 
2.  Conservation of natural vegetation wherever practical. 
3.  Reforestation. 
4.  Reestablishment of prairies and wetlands. 
5.  Increase buffers around streams, steep slopes, and wetlands to protect from flood damage and provide additional water quality treatment. 
b.  Reduction of impervious cover. 
1.  Reduce new impervious area through redevelopment of existing sites and use existing roadways, trails, etc. 
2.  Minimize street widths, parking space size, driveway length, sidewalk width. 
3.  Reduce impervious structure footprint. 
4.  Use shared parking facilities consistent with zoning requirements. 
5.  Install semi-permeable/permeable or porous paving. 
c.  Distribution and minimization of runoff. 
1.  Utilize vegetated areas for stormwater treatment. 
2.  Look for vegetated areas that can filter sheet flow, removing sediment and other pollutants, and increasing the time of concentration. 
3.  Disconnect impervious areas by allowing runoff from small impervious areas to be directed to pervious areas where it can be infiltrated or filtered. 
4.  All runoff from downspouts, driveways and other impervious areas shall be directed to pervious surfaces, where feasible, or unless the applicant can demonstrate that the practice is likely to result in groundwater contamination. 
5.  Eliminate curb and gutter where practicable, and use vegetated swales or equivalent. 
6.  Encourage infiltration and soil storage of runoff through grass channels, soil compost amendment, vegetated swales, rain gardens, etc. 
7.  Plant vegetation that does not require irrigation beyond natural rainfall and runoff from site. 
(4)  Regional ponding . If the city determines the site is not suitable for on-site treatment, off-site stormwater management and associated fees may be established, provided that provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility, and provided that all of the following conditions for the off-site facility are met: 
a.  The facility is in place or the city has knowledge of future regional ponding on site; 
b.  The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that at least meets the ordinance standards; 
c.  The city is satisfied that the facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance. 
(5)  Accepted alternatives to stormwater pond treatments . Alternative treatments may be installed and shall be reviewed and approved by the city. Alternative treatments are included but are not limited to those stated in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual. 
(6)  Maintenance of private stormwater facilities . All private stormwater facilities shall be maintained by the owner in proper condition consistent with the performance standards for which they were originally designed. 
a.  All settled materials from sumps, grit chambers, and other devices, including settled solids, shall be removed and properly disposed of on an annual basis. One- to five-year waivers from this requirement may be granted by the city when the owner presents evidence that the facility has additional capacity to remove settled solids in accordance with the original design capacity. 
b.  Ponds shall be inspected at least once every five years to determine if settled materials should be removed. Settled materials shall be removed and properly disposed of when the pond is no longer functioning at the original design capacity. 
c.  A maintenance plan must be provided that defines who will conduct the maintenance, the type of maintenance and the maintenance intervals of a private stormwater facility before the facility is approved. 
d.  All stormwater facilities must be designed to minimize the need for maintenance, to provide easy vehicle and personnel access for maintenance purposes, and be structurally sound. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the facilities for inspection or maintenance. 
e.  The city shall have the right to request and review inspection and maintenance records and shall have the right to perform an inspection of stormwater facilities at any time if the city has probable cause to believe that the facilities are not being properly maintained or inspected. A charge based on current wages will be assessed to the owner for any inspections or maintenance that needs to be performed.

Street name signs, "no parking" signs and other traffic control signs, as requested and provided by the City, may be installed on the electric and street light poles within the Company Service Area.

In the event the City reasonably determines that it is necessary for the Company to move any part of its Electric Facilities because the City has determined to change, move or improve its Public Ways or that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or imminent public use of Public Ground, upon reasonable Notice by the City to the Company, then the Company will move its Electric Facilities at its sole cost. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not to arbitrarily cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this Section 6.1. This Section 6.1 shall not constitute a taking by the City nor be construed as a waiver or modification of any easement or prescriptive rights acquired by the Company independent of and without reliance by the Company on this Franchise. 
4.2.  No Release of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any third party from liability arising out of their failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the Company's Electric Facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regarding or changing the line of any Public Way or with any construction on or adjacent to any Public Way; provided, however, this Section 6.2 shall not limit the City's rights to indemnification under Section 7.1 nor shall the City in any way be liable to the Company for claims arising from the negligence of any third party. 
SECTION 5. - INDEMNIFICATION. 
5.1.  Indemnification. If at any time any claim of any kind is made against the City for injury to persons or property arising from the acts or failure to act by the Company, its agents, servants, or employees in connection with the operations of the Company under and pursuant to this Franchise, the Company shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its agents, servants or employees from any and all such claims, including, but not limited to, reimbursement of any reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and expenses the City may incur in handling, denying, or defending such claims. The Company's obligation to indemnify the City shall not extend to any injury to persons or property caused by the negligent act or failure to act by the City or any actions taken by the Company pursuant to directions of the City if performed within the scope of the City's directions without negligence by the Company. The City shall determine who will defend any such claims arising under this Section 6.1 and the Company will thereafter have complete control of such litigation; provided, however, the Company may not settle any such claims without the prior approval of the City, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. This Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and the Company, in defending any action shall be entitled to assert every defense or immunity that the City could itself assert in its own behalf. The Company's obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration, amendment, or termination of this Ordinance. 
5.2.  Insurance. Before the Effective Date, the Company shall furnish the City a summary of insurance, if any, carried by the Company, or of its self-insured status, in either case demonstrating adequate protection to the City from any and all obligations, liabilities, or claims of any nature whatsoever, growing out of the operation, construction, and maintenance of its Electric Facilities within the City. The Company shall maintain such insurance coverage at all times during this Franchise. 
5.3.  Compliance with Laws; Hazardous Substances. In its operation under this Ordinance, the Company shall observe all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and orders with respect to the transmission, distribution, transformation or furnishing of electric energy and the handling of materials, substances and wastes deemed toxic or hazardous to health, natural resources or the environment (collectively, "Hazardous Substances"). The Company shall remove or remediate any Hazardous Substances located on, in or surrounding its Electric Facilities or caused to be located on, in or surrounding the Public Ways and Public Grounds or elsewhere in the City in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and lawful government orders, and pay or cause to be paid all costs associated therewith. The indemnification terms and conditions of Section 6.1 shall apply to all claims made against the City by any Person, including any governmental agency, who or which asserts any right to costs, damages or other relief based upon the terms and conditions imposed upon the Company under this Section 6.3 or which arise from or are related to the Company's acts or failure to act in compliance with any law, rule, regulation or lawful order governing Hazardous Substances. 
SECTION 6. - VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS. 
The City will consult with the Company at least four (4) weeks prior to its action on any proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where ordered pursuant to Section 6.1, the vacation of any Public Way after the installation of Electric Facilities shall not operate to deprive the Company of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the Company. However, in no case shall the City be liable to the Company for failure to specifically preserve a Public Way in the exercise of its authority under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29. 
SECTION 7. - ABANDONED FACILITIES. 
The Company shall comply with City ordinances and Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01 et seq., as they may be amended from time to time. The Company shall maintain records describing the exact location of all abandoned and retired Facilities within the City, produce such records at the City's request and comply with the location requirements of Section 216D.04 with respect to all Electric Facilities, including abandoned and retired Electric Facilities. 
SECTION 8. - FRANCHISE FEE. 
8.1.  Authority. The City reserves all rights under Minnesota Statutes, Sections 216B.36 and 301B.01 or other law to require a franchise fee at any time during the term of, and in consideration for, this Franchise. The franchise fee may be expressed (i) as a specified charge per measurable unit of electricity being provided, transported, transmitted, sold, furnished, delivered, or received within the City, or (ii) as a percentage of the gross revenues received by the Company for its operations within the City, or (iii) a flat fee per customer based on service to retail customers within the City or on some other similar basis, or (iv) in such other manner or fashion as the City may determine. The method of imposing the franchise fee may differ by customer class, by type of Utility, by particular circumstances of a Utility Service Provider, or by other relevant factor, and may combine the methods described in (i) through (iv) above. 
8.2.  Separate Ordinance. A franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the Council after 60 days' notice to company of the proposed fee. 
SECTION 9. - DEFAULTS. 
If the Company shall be in default in the performance of any of the material terms and conditions of this Ordinance, and shall continue in default for more than thirty (30) days (or fails to initiate the cure of the default within said period and diligently pursue said cure, if the cure of the default cannot reasonably be accomplished within said 30 days) after receiving Notice from the City of such default, the City may elect to cure such default and charge the Company for the costs thereof. 
SECTION 10. - AMENDMENT PROCEDURE. 
The Company's rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public, and this Franchise may be amended or repealed by the City as deemed necessary or appropriate in the exercise of such power.
