PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Northville, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Compiled Code, as supplemented through 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Compiled Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Delphine Gutowski, City Clerk, and Gary Word, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(c)  Disposition of violations. The bureau may dispose only of municipal civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for which a municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared with a citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine has been scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to dispose of the violation at the bureau. Nothing in sections 1-19-1-26 shall prevent or restrict the city from issuing a municipal civil infraction citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of a municipal civil infraction violation at the bureau and may have the violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the bureau shall not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's rights, privileges and protection afforded by law.

(f)  Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving a municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the bureau and pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for appearance in the municipal civil infraction violation notice. An appearance may be made by mail, in person, or by representation. 
(g)  Procedure where admission of responsibility not made or fine not paid. If an authorized city official issues and serves a municipal ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of fines for the violation are not paid at the bureau, a municipal civil infraction citation may be filed with the district court and a copy of the citation may be served by first class mail upon the alleged violator at the alleged violator's last known address. The citation filed with the court does not need to comply in all particulars with the requirements for citations as provided by sections 8705 and 8709 of the Act, but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the alleged violator how to respond to the citation.

(a)  Creation. In order that the provisions of this article may be reasonably applied and substantial justice done in instances where unnecessary hardship would result from carrying out the strict letter of this article, a housing board of appeals is hereby created. The duty of the board of appeals shall be to consider appeals from the decision of the officials charged with the enforcement of this article and to determine in particular cases whether any deviations from the strict enforcement of the article will violate the intent of the article and jeopardize public health and safety. 
(b)  Members. The board shall consist of five members, who shall be appointed by and serve at the will and pleasure of the city council. At least two members shall have such background and experience as the council shall consider essential to enable them to provide expertise in matters pertaining to building, plumbing, and electrical construction specifically and housing conditions generally. The board shall elect from its membership a chairman, vice-chairman and such other officers as it may deem necessary. The city council shall appoint two alternate members to the housing board of appeals. These alternate members shall serve at such time as any of the regular members of the board are absent and shall, when sitting on such board, have the same powers as the regular board members. 
(c)  Term of office. The term of office of the board members shall be three years, provided that in the first instance the term of two members appointed shall continue until the first Monday in July 1968, two members until the first Monday in July 1969, and one member until the first Monday in July 1970. 
(d)  Appeals. Appeals from the rulings of any official charged with the enforcement of this article may be made to the board within such time as shall be prescribed by the board. The time shall appear on any notice served. Such appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or commission of the city. The appellant shall file with the official from whose decision the appeal is taken and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the ground therefor. With each notice of appeal filed by a person aggrieved, there shall be paid a fee of $10.00 to cover the city's cost of handling the appeal; provided, however, that such fees may be returned or retained, in whole or in part, in the discretion of the board. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board a summary report of all previous action taken. The board may at its discretion call upon the official from whom the appeal is taken to explain his action. The final disposition of such appeal shall be in the form of a resolution, either reversing, modifying or affirming, wholly or partly, the decision or the determination appealed from. In order to find for the appellant, three members of the board must concur. 
(e)  Hearings. The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and give due written notice thereof to interested parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. Within the limits of its jurisdiction, the board of appeals may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the official from whom the appeal is taken. The failure of the petitioner or his representative to appear and state his case at such hearing shall have the same effect as if no petition were filed. 
(f)  Decisions. The decision of the board shall be final except that the board or the members thereof may be required under proper mandamus proceedings to show cause why certain actions were taken or decisions rendered. If it clearly appears that, by reason of special conditions, undue hardship would result from strict application of any section of this article, the board may permit a variance from the mandatory provisions thereof in such a manner that the public safety shall be secured, substantial justice be done and the spirit of the provisions of this article be upheld. 
(g)  Meetings; rules of procedure; quorum. All rules and regulations of the board of appeals shall be published in written form upon adoption and made available for public inspection. The board of appeals shall meet at such time as the board may determine. There shall be a fixed place of meeting and all meetings shall be open to the public. The board shall adopt its own rules of procedure and keep a record of its proceedings, showing the action of the board, and the vote of each member upon each question considered. The presence of three members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum; however, the petitioner shall have the right, upon written request, to receive an adjournment of hearing until such time as four members of the board are present. 
(h)  Notices. The board of appeals may prescribe such notice to any interested person and the neighbors surrounding the structure in connection with which the appeal is taken, as shall be deemed reasonable by the board of appeals. 
(i)  Officers and records. The board of appeals shall appoint a secretary who need not be a member of the board, whose duty it shall be to maintain a permanent official record of all its transactions. Such records shall be public records.

Sec. 30-31. - Findings of fact. 
    The city finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the city involved drivers who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance. In addition, the city finds that in traffic accidents involving drivers who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and property damage. As a result of these determinations, a greater operational and/or financial burden is placed upon the city police, public service, firefighting and rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance. 
(Code 1980, § 5-1401) 
Sec. 30-32. - Definitions.

Such costs and expenses shall only include those costs and expenses directly arising because of the response to the particular incident. Such costs shall include the cost of any type of chemical testing for blood alcoholic content or for the presence of controlled substances and for videotaping of the driver, if applicable. If legal action is instituted to collect the cost and expenses of emergency response under this article, all legal fees and costs incurred by the city in such a legal action shall also be included in the costs and expenses of such emergency response. 
    Emergency response means: 
(1)  The providing, sending and/or utilizing public service, police, firefighting, and/or rescue services by the city to an accident involving a motor vehicle where one or more of the drivers were operating the motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor or any controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic liquor and any controlled substance; or

The term "any bodily alcohol content" means the presence of any alcohol within the driver's body which is due to consumption of intoxicating liquor other than consumption which was part of a recognized religious ceremony. 
(2)  For purposes of this article, it shall be presumed that a person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle was under the influence if chemical analysis of the driver's blood, urine, or breath indicates the presence of any amount of a controlled substance or that the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood contained 0.04 percent or more but not more than 0.07 percent by weight of alcohol.

ARTICLE IV. - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION 

Sec. 34-111. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council hereby finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for nonagricultural uses such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational uses and roads. This erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, roads and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and road ditches, muddies streams and silts in lakes and reservoirs, and is considered a major water pollutant. 
(Code 1980, § 6-1001) 
Sec. 34-112. - Purpose of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to prevent soil erosion and the resulting sediment within the city by requiring proper provision for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience and general welfare of the community.

Sec. 42-24. - Establishment, modification, elimination of a district. 
(1)  The city council may, at any time, establish by ordinance additional historic districts, including proposed districts previously considered and rejected, may modify boundaries of an existing historic district, or may eliminate an existing historic district. Before establishing, modifying, or eliminating a historic district, a historic district study committee appointed by the city council shall, except as provided in subsection (2), comply with the procedures set forth in section 42-23 and shall consider any previously written committee reports pertinent to the proposed action. To conduct these activities, the city council may retain the initial committee, establish a standing committee, or establish a committee to consider only specific proposed districts and then be dissolved. 
(2)  If considering elimination of a historic district, a committee shall follow the procedures set forth in section 42-23 for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing, and issuing a final report but with the intent of showing one or more of the following: 
(a)  The historic district has lost those physical characteristics that enabled establishment of the district; 
(b)  The historic district was not significant in the way previously defined; 
(c)  The historic district was established pursuant to defective procedures. 
(3)  Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic, architectural, archeological, engineering, or cultural significance of a proposed historic district, the city council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed historic district be referred to the commission as prescribed in this chapter. The commission shall review permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic district was an established historic district. The review may continue in the proposed district for not more than one year, or until such time as the city council approves or rejects establishment of the historic district by ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
(4)  If the city council determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm to resources located within the historic district or proposed historic district, the city council may by resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a period not to exceed six months. The city council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.

Sec. 42-25. - Regulation of construction and alteration. 
(1)  Permit. A permit shall be obtained before new construction or other work affecting the exterior appearance or interior work which will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource within the historic district is performed. The historic district commission does not regulate ordinary maintenance, as defined in this chapter. The person, individual, partnership, firms, corporation, organization, institution or agency of government proposing to do the work shall file an application for a building permit with the building inspector. Following receipt of a complete application and all supporting documentation, the building inspector shall immediately refer the application and all required supporting material to the commission. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed until the commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed. 
(2)  Review. It shall be the duty of the commission to review all such applications and plans. The commission shall have the power to approve or deny such plans. The commission shall not issue a certificate of appropriateness unless the applicant certifies in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the Stille-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 to 125.1531. 
(3)  Fees. At the time of making application, the person or entity proposing to do the work shall pay the fee as determined from time to time by the city council. An application shall not be considered complete until the fee has been paid in full. No fee shall be charged for applications seeking only color change, reroofing or minor classes of work. 
(4)  Matters considered. In reviewing plans, the commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings as set forth in 36 C.F.R., part 67, as amended, [and] give consideration to all of the following: 
(i)  The historic or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area. 
(ii)  The relationship of any architectural features of the resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding area. 
(iii)  The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used. 
(iv)  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission finds relevant. 
(v)  Whether the applicant has certified in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the Stille-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 to 125.1531.

(Ord. No. 9-15-03, 10-6-03; Ord. No. 02-01-10, §§ 1, 2, 2-16-10) 
Sec. 42-27. - Action by commission. 
(1)  Approval. 
(a)  If the commission approves plan(s), it shall direct the building inspector to make a notation on the building permit and process the application. 
(b)  The commission must act within 60 calendar days after the date a complete application is filed with the commission. Failure to act shall constitute approval unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the commission. 
(2)  Adverse impact on resource. If an application is for work which will adversely affect the exterior of a resource the commission considers valuable to the local unit, state, or nation, and the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the local unit, state, or nation, the commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
(3)  Notice to proceed. Work on a resource shall be permitted through issuance of notice to proceed if any of the following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding of the commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(a)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or the occupants. 
(b)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing and environmental clearances. 
(c)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, has been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(d)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community. 
(4)  Regulation of demolition and moving. 
(a)  The demolition or moving of resources within the historic district shall be discouraged. The commission may, however, after careful consideration of the effect of the move on the resource in question and on the entire historic district, issue a notice to proceed for moving or demolition of a resource. The commission shall issue a notice to proceed for approval of moving or demolition only if any of the preceding conditions ([listed in subsection] 42-27(3)) prevail, as more fully explained in the guidelines for the consideration of applications for the demolition or moving of structures, and if in the opinion of the commission the proposed changes will materially improve or correct these conditions. 
(b)  Notice to proceed with demolition may be issued either with or without reservation. Approval issued without reservation shall become effective immediately. Approval issued with reservation due to the historical/architectural/environmental significance of the involved resource shall not become effective until at least six months after the date of such issuance in order to provide a period of time within which it may be possible to relieve a hardship or to cause the property to be transferred to another owner who will retain it. The applicant must provide documentation, including photographs of the structure for the historical society archives. 
(c)  Demolition by arson proven to be caused by the owner or the owner's agent shall require the restoration of the structure and authorize the commission to proceed under the powers delineated in section 42-29 of this chapter. 
(5)  Approval of minor classes of work. The commission may delegate the issuance of certificate(s) of appropriateness for specified minor classes of work to the inspector of buildings. The commission shall provide specific written standards to the delegated authority for issuing certificate(s) of appropriateness through its policies. On at least a quarterly basis, the building inspector shall submit the certificate(s) of appropriateness, if any, to the commission for review. 
(6)  Denial of permit application. In the event the commission denies the permit application, it shall provide a written explanation for the reasons of denial and, if appropriate, a notice that an application may be resubmitted for commission review when suggested changes have been made. The denial shall also include notification of the applicant's right of appeal to the state historic preservation review board and the circuit court. A denial shall be binding on the building inspector and other departments in the city.

The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the decision is furnished to the applicant. The appellant may submit all or part of the appellant's evidence and arguments in written form. An applicant aggrieved by the decision of the state historic preservation review board may appeal the decision to the Wayne County Circuit Court. 
(2)  Appeal by citizen or historic preservation organization. Any citizen or duly organized historic preservation organization in the city, as well as resource property owners, jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the historic district commission may appeal the decision to the circuit court, except that a permit applicant aggrieved by a decision rendered under section 42-27 of this chapter may not appeal to the court without first exhausting the right to appeal to the state historic preservation review pursuant [to] subsection (1) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 9-15-03, 10-6-03; Ord. No. 02-01-10, §§ 1, 2, 2-16-10) 
Sec. 42-29. - Demolition by neglect. 
    Upon a finding by the commission that a historic resource within a historic district or proposed historic district subject to its review and approval is threatened with demolition by neglect, the commission may do either of the following: 
(1)  Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing to demolition by neglect. 
(2)  If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the commission or its agents may enter the property, after obtaining an order from the circuit court, and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The cost of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the city as a special assessment against the property if the costs remain unpaid 30 days after the owner has been notified of the cost. 
In the event that efforts by the commission to preserve a resource fail, the commission may recommend to the city council that public ownership of the resource is most suitable. The city council may proceed under section 7 of PA 96 of 1992. 
(Ord. No. 9-15-03, 10-6-03) 
Sec. 42-30. - Work done without a permit. 
(1)  Restoration or modification. When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate(s) of appropriateness, the commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate work was done, or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate(s) of appropriateness. 
(2)  Application to circuit court. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the commission may seek an order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate(s) of appropriateness. 
(3)  Authority for commission to do work. If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the court, the commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate(s) of appropriateness in accordance with the court's order. 
(4)  Assessment of costs. The costs of the work may be charged to the owner and may be levied by the city as a special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to an order of the circuit court, a commission or its agents may enter the property for purposes of this section.

(Ord. No. 9-15-03, 10-6-03) 
Sec. 42-32. - Moratorium. 
    If the city council determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm to resources located within an established historic district or a proposed historic district, the city council may by resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a period not to exceed six months. The city council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six months upon a finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied. 
(Ord. No. 9-15-03, 10-6-03) 
Sec. 42-33. - Severability.

(3)  Reconstruction or repair.

ARTICLE V. - NEWSRACKS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Ord. No. 08-03-98, § 1, adopted Dec. 7, 1998, which pertains to use of public utility easements and rights-of-way by telecommunications providers, amended the Code by the addition of Ch. 74, Art. V. However, the adoption of Ord. No. 08-03-98 by reference has been redesignated as § 80-31, at the editor's discretion, for purposes of allowing future expansion of the telecommunications subject matter. Ord. No. 11-20-00, pertaining to newsracks, was adopted by the city subsequently, and has been included herein as Ch. 74, Art. V. 

Sec. 74-131. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city hereby finds and declares: 
(1)  The city has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks, that newsracks are properly maintained, and that newsracks do not create a visual blight in the historic downtown. 
(2)  In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on city streets, and particularly poorly maintained or abandoned freestanding newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property, resulted in visual blight, and hindered the ability of public services such as sidewalk and street cleaning. Certain newsracks have been placed in inappropriate locations, been abandoned, and are poorly maintained. 
(3)  The city has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities as identified in the city's historic district guidelines. To that end, and consistent with the City of Northville Commercial Planning Study prepared by the Gibbs/Green team, it is in the best interest of the city and its historic downtown to take steps to solve and reduce the negative effects of this problem. 
(4)  An effective way to remedy this problem is to require that all newspapers and other publications desiring to be sold or provided in newspaper racks on city sidewalks or other public property or rights-of-way be placed in and sold from modular units which are provided by the city at locations commensurate with the locations at which newspapers and other publications are currently being sold or provided. 
(5)  The purpose of this article is to accomplish the following: 
a.  Provide for increased pedestrian and vehicular safety and convenience; 
b.  Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
c.  Ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly located newsracks; 
d.  Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, benches, planters, delivery areas, loading zones, and curb ramps; 
e.  Reduce visual blight, clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained, improperly located or abandoned newsracks; 
f.  Protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of historic downtown Northville; 
g.  Advance the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents, including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of newspapers and news periodicals through newsracks; and 
h.  Prevent newsracks from unduly interfering with city sidewalk and street cleaners as well as other public services. 
(6)  In adopting this article, the city is mindful that regulation of newsracks implicates rights protected by the Constitution of both the United States and the state. To that end, this article was drafted and shall be applied and enforced in a manner consistent with these constitutional rights. The content or viewpoint of the material to be distributed through modular newsracks shall not be considered in administering or enforcing this article. 
(7)  Given the limited space available and the increasing congestion on certain public sidewalks, streets and rights-of-way, the city has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack placement in those locales to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers. This objective may be achieved by providing modular newsrack units in specified locations in the downtown. Utilizing newsrack units and prohibiting freestanding newsracks will promote the city's interest in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city, and advancing the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion. 
(8)  A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this article, which reasonably regulates the placement of newsracks in specified areas.

    City manager means the city manager or his or her designee. 
    Cluster of modular newsrack units means two or more modular newsrack units located such that each unit is within a 25-foot radius of another unit. 
    Freestanding newsrack means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser installed, used for, or maintained for the display and sale or the distribution without charge of newspapers, news periodicals or other publications, and which is not a modular newsrack unit authorized under this article. 
    Modular newsrack unit means a newsrack that is provided by the city for the placement of publications to be sold or distributed in the city on public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way. 
    Newsrack means a newsrack box, a freestanding newsrack, or modular newsrack unit. 
    Newsrack box shall mean the individual space within a modular newsrack unit that dispenses one newspaper or other periodical, including the door, coin return mechanism and associated hardware. "Newsrack box" does not include any freestanding newsrack. 
    Public property means parks, squares, plazas, and any other real property owned by the city, except for public rights-of-way as defined by this section. 
    Public right-of-way means land which by deed, conveyance, agreement, easement, dedication, usage or process of law is reserved and dedicated to the general public for street, highway, alley, public utility, or pedestrian walkway purposes, whether or not said land has been improved or accepted for maintenance by the city.

Sec. 74-134. - City manager. 
(a)  The city manager shall be responsible for carrying out the provisions of this article and for performing the duties described herein. 
(b)  It is the intent of the city council that the duties imposed upon the city manager by this article be directory in nature, and that as a result, the city manager's failure to comply with a particular procedural step shall not invalidate any subsequent action by the city manager to which the procedural requirement relates. 
(Ord. No. 11-20-00, 1-3-01) 
Sec. 74-135. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no newsracks other than modular newsrack units provided by the city may be placed, operated or maintained on any public street, sidewalk or public right-of-way or portion thereof. 
(b)  No newsrack box or modular newsrack unit shall be used for advertising signs or publicity purposes. However, each publication may attach a decal no larger than three inches high and 16 inches wide, in white script letters only, to a specified area on the front of its newsrack boxes for the purpose of displaying the name of the publication contained in the newsrack box. The publication shall be responsible for ensuring that any such decals are maintained in a clean and good condition. 
(c)  No person or entity shall violate any other section, subsection, guideline or provision of this article. 
(Ord. No. 11-20-00, 1-3-01) 
Sec. 74-136. - Registration. 
(a)  Requirement. Registration with the city is necessary to facilitate the regulation and inspection of newsrack boxes and to allocate space for the purposes set forth in this article. No person may place any publication in any modular newsrack unit on a public sidewalk, street, public right-of-way or portion thereof for the purpose of sale or distribution without having first registered with the city. 
(b)  Duty to register. Each publication seeking access to a modular newsrack unit shall register with the city for each location and for each unit at which the publication seeks access. The registered publication shall be responsible for the payment of all fees or penalties due or imposed under this article with respect to that registered publication's modular newsrack unit(s) or newsrack box. 
(c)  Registration. Registration for placement in a modular newsrack unit shall be made in writing and filed with the city manager's office. The application package shall inform the applicant to the requirements of this article and the guidelines provided herein. 
(d)  Approval. Upon receipt of a properly completed application from a publication, or from the agent for a publication, accompanied by written authorization from the publication along with the required fee, the city manager shall register the publication for placement in a modular newsrack unit within 15 working days of receipt of the application, unless based on the requirements of this article or the guidelines provided herein there are grounds requiring denial of the application. If an application is disapproved in whole or in part, the city manager shall notify the applicant promptly in writing within 15 working days of receipt of application, explaining the reasons for the denial. 
(e)  Effect of registration. The city council specifically determines that the approval of an application and registration of a publication by the city pursuant to this section confers a non-transferable, revocable privilege on the registered publication. In addition, the city council may at any time in its exclusive legislative discretion elect to repeal or amend this article and thereby render null and void any approval/registration issued pursuant this section. 
(f)  Fees. There shall be an annual registration fee to be paid by all publications to the city manager's office for each newsrack box utilized by the publication for the sale or distribution of its publications. The amount of this registration fee shall be set forth in a schedule established by city council. The fee is not for the purpose of generating revenues or to reimburse the city for its costs in purchasing the modular newsrack units. The purpose of the fee is to cover the cost incurred in maintaining the exterior of the modular newsrack units and repairing or replacing damaged units. The fee shall be reviewed annually by the city manager, who shall propose to the city council, if necessary, any recommended adjustments, along with written justification for the adjustment and any necessary amendment to Appendix A. If a publication fails to pay the required fee within 30 days after it becomes due, the city manager shall provide written notice that registration will be revoked and the newsrack box removed if the fee is not paid within ten days of this notice. If the fee is not paid within ten days, registration shall be revoked and the newsrack box removed. 
(Ord. No. 11-20-00, 1-3-01) 
Sec. 74-137. - Locations. 
(a)  The precise locations of modular newsrack units in the city shall be recommended by the city manager and presented on a detailed map of the downtown for approval by the city council. The following factors shall be taken into account: 
(1)  The locations being utilized prior to the adoption of this article, including the publications' desire to maintain these locations and the number of publications present at each location; 
(2)  Pedestrian and vehicular congestion, traffic and safety considerations at certain locations, including impediments to access by individuals with disabilities, and interference with public services; 
(3)  Demand for and access to publications at the locations, including the availability of alternative channels of distribution other than through newsracks;

(6)  Sight lines and access to buildings with first floor retail spaces. 
(b)  Any interested person may petition the city manager to request the addition of one or more additional modular newsrack unit locations. Such petition shall be in writing, and shall include written statements from publications that are willing to register for each proposed location. Upon receiving such a petition, the city manager will present the request to the city council within 45 days of receipt thereof to determine whether the placement of one or more additional modular newsrack units in the proposed new location would be authorized under the requirements of this article and its guidelines. The city council shall consider a request for the creation of a new location(s) for the installation of one or more modular newsrack units if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  All other requirements of this article have been met with regard to the location; 
(2)  There are no other modular newsrack units within 50 feet of the proposed location; 
(3)  The location will not unreasonably impede pedestrian traffic, prevent the performance of essential public services such as sidewalk sweeping, and will not create a traffic hazard;

Sec. 74-138. - Allocation of space in modular newsrack units. 
(a)  With respect to publications' access to specific modular newsrack units, space shall be allocated based upon frequency of publication as follows: 
(1)  First priority shall be given to publications which are distributed at least five days per a week, inclusive of their Saturday, Sunday or weekend editions whether or not published jointly with another newspaper; 
(2)  Second priority shall be given to publications between one and four times per week; 
(3)  Third priority shall be given to publications published between two and four times per month; and 
(4)  Fourth priority shall be given to publications published one time per month or less.

(c)  In implementing this allocation scheme as to each modular newsrack unit or cluster of modular newsrack units, the city manager shall conduct a meeting at which time each category beginning with category (1) daily and weekly publications, will be allowed to select a position in a given location. When each publication in that category that so desires has chosen a position in that location, each publication in category (2) shall select a position and so forth through category (4). The publications in each category may agree among themselves as to the order they will follow in selecting positions. If they are unable to agree, the city manager shall determine the order within each category by drawing lots. 
(d)  If all available modular newsrack units are filled and a publication decides to vacate a space in a modular newsrack unit, the city manager shall maintain a list of publications that are interested in additional spaces as they become available, and shall provide notice to these publications when spaces become available. The city manager shall assign a publication to the available space in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. 
(e)  Where a publication not previously distributed seeks access to a modular newsrack unit in a location, such publication shall first endeavor to locate in any vacant spaces of an existing modular newsrack unit before requesting that the city manager provide an additional modular newsrack unit. 
(f)  In any circumstances where a publication decides to vacate a location or a newsrack box, the publication shall promptly notify the city manager of the intention to vacate the location. 
(Ord. No. 11-20-00, 1-3-01) 
Sec. 74-139. - Maintenance. 
(a)  The city shall be responsible for maintenance of the exterior of all modular newsrack units excluding any decal or sign indicating the name of the publication. A replacement unit shall be provided by the city while it repairs or refurbishes a modular newsrack unit. The cost of the maintenance and replacement shall be the responsibility of the city downtown development authority (DDA). The city shall provide a replacement unit within 48 hours after being notified that a unit is damaged and the city determines that the unit needs immediate repair. If the city fails to provide a replacement unit, the publication(s) contained in the unit may temporarily place a freestanding newsrack in the same location until a replacement unit is provided by the city. 
(b)  The publications shall be responsible for maintenance of the doors and door mechanisms as well as the interior of the modular newsrack units or newsrack box including all mechanical equipment.

In the case of coin-operated newsrack boxes, the publication shall be responsible for maintenance of the coin-operated mechanism, including the coin return. Any damage to the modular newsrack unit resulting from maintenance, theft or vandalism to the coin mechanism shall be repaired by the publication.

Such a request must be filed at the city clerk's office not more than ten business days following the city manager's decision or the denial. The city council shall consider the request at its next regularly-scheduled meeting, consistent with public meeting law requirements, and shall vote either to affirm or reverse the city manager's decision or the denial. The city council's decision shall be provided to the city manager within two business days, and the city manager shall immediately notify the person of the decision. The city manager shall act in accordance with the decision of the city council. 
(b)  In the event that a person remains aggrieved after an appeal to the city council, the person may provide to the city manager within ten days of the decision of the city council a notice of intent to institute legal proceedings against the city. Once the city manager has received this notice, the city manager shall reasonably accommodate the person's request until the earlier of the time that a lawsuit is filed against the city or 60 days from the receipt of the notice of intent.

(c)  The city manager is authorized to remove and impound any unauthorized newsracks in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  Notice of violation and impoundment. The city manager shall post a notice of violation on the unauthorized newsrack, and shall use all reasonable efforts to immediately contact the owner of the newsrack or other responsible party by facsimile and telephone where this information is contained on the newsrack or available from the city manager's records. The notice attached to the newsrack, and any written notice transmitted to the owner shall also inform the owner of the right to request by facsimile, telephone or in person by the close of business on the first business day following the date of the notice of violation, a meeting with the city manager to determine whether the newsrack is in violation of this article. If the newsrack has not been removed, and the owner has not requested a meeting with the city manager by the close of the next business day following the day that the notice of violation has been affixed, the city manager may remove and impound the offending newsrack. Within 48 hours after the removal, the city manager shall notify the owner in writing of the removal and the reasons for removal. If the owner did not request a meeting with the city manager prior to removal of the newsrack, the notice shall also inform the owner of the right to request, either in writing or in person, within five business days of the date of the postmark of such written notice, a meeting with the city manager to determine whether such removal was proper. 
(2)  Meeting and decision. Upon timely request, the city manager shall provide such a meeting by the close of the next business day following receipt of the request, unless the owner agrees to a later date. The proceeding shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be offered. The city manager shall give his or her decision in writing to the owner within three business days after such meeting. If no meeting has been requested, and/or the city manager finds that the impoundment was proper, the city manager shall notify the owner that the impounded newsrack may be recovered following payment of a fine as set forth in Appendix A. If the city manager finds that the impoundment was improper and/or that placement of the newsrack was lawful, the city manager shall order the immediate release to the owner and reinstallation by the city at its expense of the newsrack without charge. 
(3)  Disposal of impounded newsracks. Newsracks that are not claimed within 30 calendar days of impoundment shall be disposed of in a manner determined by the city manager in accordance with state law.

DIVISION 4. - IMPROVEMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS 

Sec. 78-131. - Streets. 
(a)  Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the continuation of principal existing streets in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the street so continued or projected. The centerline of such streets shall continue with the centerline of existing streets. 
(b)  Extensions. In general, the streets shall extend to the boundary of the subdivisions to provide the proper access to adjoining property, and provide for proper connection with the highway system for contiguous land. 
(c)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be laid out in such a manner that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(d)  Tangents. A tangent (a straight line) at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(e)  Coordinations with existing street systems. Where the commission has adopted a plat or plat of a neighborhood or area of which the subdivision is a part and the proposed plat provided coordination with the street systems of the city different from that of the continuations or projections of existing streets, and the proprietor's plat conforms in general to such neighborhood or area plat or plan of the commission, the commission may approve the proprietor's plat. 
(f)  Plan of proposed future street systems. Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the proprietor's tract, a plan of a proposed future street system of the unsubmitted part shall be considered in the light of adjustment and connections with the street system of the part not submitted. 
(g)  Treatments for protection of residential properties from traffic. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a no access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(h)  Access. Where basic arterial intercounty highways (county primary highways) are existing or proposed on the thoroughfare and streets plan for the city and the lands on both sides of the right-of-way are undeveloped or partially developed, the commission may require that any new development shall back or side the lots to the right-of-way, or provide a 22-foot paved access drive with not less than 35 feet of right-of-way. The final plan of any subdivision shall indicate on the plat that no lot shall have access to the primary road right-of-way, other than by way of a local street required for adequate circulation within the subdivision. 
(i)  Large allotments. Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building lots, the platting shall not be such as to stop the opening of major streets and the extension of adjacent minor streets which, in the judgment of the commission, should ultimately be opened and extended. 
(j)  Street intersections. Streets shall be required to intersect each other at as nearly right angles as practicable, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60 degrees. The angle of intersection shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet from the centerline of the intersecting street. 
(k)  Dedication of half-streets. The dedication of half-streets will be permitted wherever there already exists a dedicated and recorded half-street or alley on an adjoining plat. The other half must be dedicated on the proposed plat and make the street or alley complete. 
(l)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end or cul-de-sac streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than 400 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 110 feet.

(n)  Minimum widths of minor streets. The minimum width for minor streets shall be 60 feet, except in cases where the topography or special conditions make a street of less width more suitable, the commission may waive this subsection. 
(o)  Street grades. Profiles may be required of all streets at the discretion of the commission. The maximum grade allowed shall be four percent. The city engineer may waive such requirements if circumstances warrant. 
(p)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
(q)  Cross sections. The street cross section shall provide a slope from the property line to the curb. There shall be a minimum grade or wash of one-quarter of an inch per foot for the sidewalk and a minimum grade of three-eighths of an inch per foot for the area between the sidewalk and the curb. 
(r)  Corner radii. Curb corners shall be rounded with a radius of not less than 25 feet where a subdivision street intersects a main highway. Curb corners shall be rounded with a radius of not less than 15 feet where a subdivision street intersects another subdivision street. Intersections with an angle of less than 90 degrees shall be considered undesirable. 
(s)  Access to streets across ditches. The proprietor shall provide access to all proposed streets across watercourses or ditches in a manner approved by the city engineer. 
(t)  Street and subdivision names. All proposed streets obviously in alignment with another already existing street must bear the same name. New street names shall not duplicate existing street names and all names must be approved by the city council. 
(u)  Duplication of subdivision names. Duplication of proposed subdivision names, with the names of those already existing, will not be permitted.

(b)  Minimum width. The width of an alley shall be not less than 24 feet. 
(c)  Intersections; changes in alignment. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. Such cutoff shall be sufficient to provide a minimum inside turning radius of not less than 30 feet. 
(d)  Dead-ends. Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted. 
(Code 1980, § 4-815) 
Sec. 78-133. - Easements.

(b)  Underground lines for street lighting. Underground lines for the street lighting system within a subdivision shall be installed in easements necessary for the same. Such easements shall be provided in the plat and approved by the utility. 
(c)  Stormwater or drainage. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as shall be approved by the Wayne or Oakland County drain commission and/or the city engineer. Such drainage easements or land within a public utility easement for major power transmission lines shall not be considered a part of the minimum required lot area, but shall be considered in computing density under a unit development plan. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. 
(Code 1980, § 4-816) 
Sec. 78-134. - Monuments. 
    Monuments shall conform to and shall be placed as required by MCL 560.101 et seq., MSA 26.430(101) et seq., as amended. The city shall, in addition, require a surveyor's certificate guaranteeing the rechecking and replacing of monuments and bringing them to grade after sidewalks are in place.

(b)  The area of a lot or parcel, classified as business or commercial, shall be sufficient in size as to provide an area for off-street parking at least equal to 21/2 times the size of the gross floor areas of the building. Gross floor area shall be based on outside building dimensions and shall include the first floor, basement, mezzanine, and upper floor areas excluding storage and utility areas, trash closets, service areas outside the building such as boiler rooms, tunnels, corridors and loading or unloading space. This requirement shall be included in the subdivision restrictions. 
(c)  The proprietor and the commission shall consider the off-street parking provisions other than above as provided for in the zoning ordinance and make adequate allowance for the same. 
(d)  Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets. Any deviation shall require review and approval of the commission. 
(e)  Lot lines. All side lot lines should be at right angles to straight street lines, or radical to curved street lines, unless a variation from this rule will give a better street and lot plan. 
(f)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the maintenance of building lines on both the front and side streets and such corner lots shall have a minimum width of not less than 75 feet at the front or rear building line whichever is the least. 
(g)  Lots with double frontage. Lots with double frontage shall be avoided, but, if provided, the lots must have sufficient depth so that a reasonable front yard may be provided on both street frontages to protect similar frontages on adjacent lots in each direction. 
(Code 1980, § 4-819) 
Sec. 78-137. - Open spaces at parks, schools, playground sites and other areas. 
(a)  Due consideration shall be given by the proprietor and the commission to the dedication or reservation of suitable sites for future schools, parks, and playgrounds, the location of these features to conform as nearly as possible to the comprehensive plan of the city. 
(b)  Where deemed essential by the commission, upon consideration of the particular type of development proposed in the subdivision, and especially in large-scale neighborhood unit development not anticipated in the comprehensive plan, the commission may require the dedication or reservation of such other areas or sites of a character, extent and location suitable to the needs created by such development for schools, parks, playgrounds and other neighborhood purposes. 
(c)  Existing features which would add value to residential development, such as trees, exceptionally fine groves of trees, watercourses, scenic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible through harmonious design of the subdivision.

Sec. 86-146. - Sewer user charge system model. 
(a)  The city council and the mayor have devised a means of raising the necessary funds which they believe is both workable and just to the citizens of the community, and which provides a rational and predictable method of paying for the cost of wastewater collection, transport and treatment services provided by the city to its citizens. 
(b)  The community must require that adequate revenues are collected for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the wastewater collection and transport system. Replacement generally refers to equipment which has a useful life of less than 20 years. 
(c)  Each user must pay its proportional share of the operation, maintenance and replacement cost of the wastewater collection and transport system based on the user's proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from all users. 
(d)  The sewer user charge system model uses categories of costs associated with the operation, maintenance, replacement and debt retirement costs related to the wastewater collection and transport system. Actual cost from the previous fiscal year records are used to calculate a rate per sewer unit charge required to fully fund the next fiscal years operation, maintenance, replacement and debt retirement needs. The resulting rate per sewer unit charge will be adopted by resolution of the city council, after appropriate public notice and hearing, pursuant to the authority of section 86-138. 
(e)  The rate per sewer unit charge will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that it is accurate and the resulting rate will be calculated by the following formula and procedure:

(1)  Where landmark trees are permitted to be removed, replacement trees shall be provided to a minimum of 50 percent of DBH of the tree to be removed. Replacement trees, measured in calipers, shall be provided either individually or on an accumulative basis to meet the 50 percent DBH requirement. 
(2)  For nonlandmark trees, the permit grantee shall either relocate trees or replace trees subject to the following requirements: 
REPLACEMENT/MITIGATION 
REQUIREMENTS 
FOR NONLANDMARK TREES Size of Removed Tree DBH (Each) Total Inches of Replacement for Each Tree Removed 6"-11" DBH 21/2" of caliper for replacement 11.1"-20" DBH 5" of caliper for replacement Greater than 20" DBH 71/2" of caliper for replacement  
(3)  All replacement trees shall measure a minimum two-and-one-half-inch caliper for deciduous trees, and shall be eight feet high for evergreen trees, or greater. For purposes of meeting the mitigation requirements, each two feet of height of evergreen trees over eight feet in height shall be considered equal to one-half inch of caliper of deciduous trees. Where it is not feasible and/or desirable to replace or relocate trees on site, according to the above listed schedule, the planning commission may require greater size for replacement trees, require replacement trees at another location on public property in the city, or require contributions to the city's environmental resources trust fund. 
Where an applicant demonstrates that it is not possible to mitigate all replacements on site, the planning commission may also consider the planting of shrubs for trees at a ratio of no less than six shrubs per required replacement tree or two understory ornamental trees per one required replacement tree. 
(4)  Replacement trees should be of similar characteristics as the trees to be removed. Replacement species shall be reviewed by the building department or planning commission to determine compatibility and similar characteristics of plant material removed. 
(5)  Replacement trees shall have shade potential and other characteristics comparable to the trees proposed for removal and shall be state department of agriculture nursery grade no. 1 stock or better. Replacement trees shall be staked, wrapped and mulched, and shall be guaranteed for two years.

The replacements shall have at least equal shade potential and other characteristics comparable to those of the damaged trees and shall be a minimum 2.5-inch caliper, excluding landmark trees. Landmark trees shall be replaced at 100 percent DBH on an individual or a cumulative basis using minimum 2.5-inch caliper stock. 
(8)  Trees required to be planted in accordance with this section shall be in place and properly supported prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. The centers of said trees shall not be located closer than four feet to any property line or ten feet to any underground utility line or easement.

(b)  Environmental trust fund. On-site replacement and/or relocation shall be required for permitted activities in accordance with the replacement schedule of this section. Every effort shall be made to relocate or mitigate trees on site. Off-site mitigation or contribution to the city's environmental trust fund shall only be allowed after the applicant has demonstrated that on site mitigation is not practical or feasible. The requirement for on-site mitigation may be altered or waived by the planning commission if the proposal meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  The proposal meets all other ordinance requirements (i.e. lot coverage, setbacks, parking setbacks, etc.). 
(2)  The applicant can clearly demonstrate that there is inadequate planting area for the healthy installation of the required trees on site and that maximum effort has been put into locating as many of the required trees as possible. 
(3)  The applicant has made every reasonable effort to preserve as many of the existing on-site trees as possible. 
(4)  The proposal demonstrates environmental sensitive design in terms of topography, stormwater management, soil erosion management, etc. 
Should the proposal meet the above criteria, the planning commission may reduce the requirement for on-site mitigation of replacement trees and permit mitigation off-site at an approved location or by contribution to the city's environmental trust "fund." Off-site mitigation or financial contribution shall only apply if the planning commission should determine that no practical or feasible alternative exists for on site mitigation. Payment to the fund per tree removed shall be in accordance with replacement fee schedules as established by the Northville City Council. 
(c)  Replacement tree standards. All replacement trees shall: 
(1)  Meet both the American Association of Nursery (A.N.A.) standards and the requirements of the state department of agriculture. 
(2)  Be grown in a licensed nursery or approved equal. 
(3)  Be guaranteed for two years, including labor to remove and dispose of dead material. 
(4)  Be replaced immediately after the removal of the dead tree, in accordance with the A.N.A. standards and approved by the building department. 
(5)  Be of the same characteristics as the removed trees. When replacement trees of the same species are not available from Michigan nurseries or from other nurseries with similar United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) hardness zones, the applicant may substitute any species listed in section 90-34 provided that shade trees are substituted with shade trees. Ornamental trees need not necessarily be replaced with ornamental trees but it shall be encouraged where feasible. 
(6)  Be located on the same parcel of land on which the activity is to be conducted. Where tree relocation or replacement is not possible on the same property on which the activity is to be conducted, the permit grantee shall pay monies into the environmental resources trust fund (subsection (2)) for tree replacement within the city or plant trees off-site per planning commission approval (subsection (b)(2)).

Article 10 Central Business District (CBD)
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 10 - 1 Article 10
ARTICLE 10
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD)
SECTION 10.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The City of Northville downtown area serves a central place function to the urbanized area about
it. The purpose of the Central Business District is to create an area of high intensity urban
conditions providing convenient and accessible goods and services within an aesthetically pleasing
environment. A diversity of intensively developed land, satisfying a wide range of goods and
services including institutional and cultural services is essential to the enhancement of the City of
Northville as an urban central place. Land in the City of Northville is a scarce resource and use
activities which tend to require large amounts of open space are inconsistent with the use of land
for a CBD purpose. On the other hand, multi-purpose buildings which include a mix of retail,
service, and office uses and shared parking are seen as consistent with the role of the CBD area.

SECTION 10.05 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT  OVERLAY (CBD-O)
a. Preamble: It is recognized that the North Center Central Business District Overlay
Zone is a unique area of the CBD which requires special zoning regulations. The
North Center Street area is different than Main Street because many buildings on
North Center Street do not share common walls. Parcels are generally accessed by
individual driveways, and the buildings are set back from the right-of-way rather
than being located on the right-of-way. North Center Street also abuts single-family
and multi-family residential areas. Because of these and other distinctions, a
separate CBD overlay district has been created.
The overlay district will allow a mix of land uses designed to serve the commercial
and residential needs of the community in an attractive, well-designed, and
functional environment. It is designed to promote development consistent with the
Article 10 Central Business District (CBD)
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 10 - 5 Article 10
City of Northville Master Plan, and in a manner which assures quality building
design and site development. It is further intended to regulate the location of
parking and ensure adequate buffers from adjoining residential areas.
b. Uses Permitted by Right: All permitted uses within the CBD zoning district as listed
in Section 10.02, and including first floor residential uses, shall be allowed within
the CBD-O District. Permitted residential uses shall include single-family and
multi-family residential dwelling units, as defined in this ordinance.
(Rev. 5/18)
c. Special Land Uses Permitted After Review and Approval: All special land uses
listed within Section 10.03 shall be permitted, subject to Planning Commission
approval, within the CBD-O District.

requirements of Section 17.02. Cash in lieu of parking (Section 17.03) shall not be
permitted within the Central Business District  Overlay (CBD-O).
Figure 4. Central Business District Overlay Screening/Landscaping Requirements
k. Pedestrian/Non-Motorized Enhancements: Sidewalks shall be required along all
street frontages, in accordance with Chapter 74 of the Northville Code of
Ordinances. Where possible, sidewalks shall be positioned five (5) feet back of
curb for public safety and to facilitate pedestrian connection between residential
and commercial areas. Pedestrian and non-motorized enhancements shall be
consistent with Complete Streets (Public Acts 134 and 135 of 2010). Curb bump
outs, crosswalks, pedestrian refuge islands, or other safety barriers are encouraged
to enhance pedestrian safety. Bike racks shall be considered at appropriate
locations.
l. Streetscape: Streetscape furnishings, including street trees, tree grates, special
concrete finishing, pavers, and decorative lighting, shall be considered along all
frontages along North Center Street. Streetscape furnishings shall be
Article 10 Central Business District (CBD)
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 10 - 10 Article 10
complimentary to the City of Northville Downtown Development Authority (DDA)
standards. At least one (1) canopy tree shall be provided for each forty (40) lineal
feet.
m. Stormwater Management: Future development shall incorporate Low Impact
Development (LID) techniques for stormwater management where practical. This
shall include infiltration and on-site retention. Developers are encouraged to
consult the Low Impact Development Manual for Michigan developed by the
Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. Possible LID techniques include:
- Inverted parking lot islands
- Pervious paving materials
- Bioswales
- Other techniques for infiltration and on-site retention
n. Architecture: It is the intent of the Central Business District Overlay Zone to
provide high-quality building materials and complimentary building architecture.
Architectural guidelines shall include the following:
- First floor architecture shall be compatible with sidewalk areas and shall
provide an attractive interface between buildings and pedestrians. This
shall be accomplished with generous window areas, recesses, and
architectural detail.
- Buildings shall have an orientation to the street and front sidewalk, with a
functioning entrance which enhances the continuity of the pedestrianoriented
environment.
- Where possible, there shall be a minimal grade differential between the
elevation of the sidewalk and the first floor elevation of the adjoining

flanking buildings. Wider sidewalks and/or further setback from the
corners edge is encouraged to retain a line-of-sight through the corner.
2) Form and Function: Use of ground level open-aired areas at the intersection
of the sidewalks is encouraged. The design of open-aired areas or
pedestrian plazas adds aesthetic distinction to the façade and compliments
the pedestrian atmosphere of North Center Street. Integrating
covered/uncovered seating and resting areas is highly encouraged.
p. The Planning Commission may waive or modify the design standards or landscape
requirements of this section where one (1) or more of the following factors are
demonstrated:
1) Architectural constraints and unique building characteristics.
2) Compatibility with surrounding architecture and site design.
3) Site constraints regarding size of parcel, circulation, limited right-of-way,
etc.
4) Other factors as identified by the Planning Commission.
SECTION 10.06 CADY STREET OVERLAY (CSO)
a. Preamble: It is recognized that Cady Street and Cady Town are unique areas on
the southern edge of the CBD which require special zoning regulations. Parcels
within these areas are on the downtown fringe and are logically situated for growth
and new investment. Additionally, the Middle Rouge River presents opportunities
for riverfront amenities. Because of these and other distinctions, a separate Cady
Street Overlay (CSO) district has been created. The CSO district addresses special
siting, design and compatibility issues that require development regulations in
addition to those found in the underlying zoning districts. When the standards of
the CSO district conflict with those of the underlying district, the standards of the
CSO shall govern.
The Cady Street Overlay district is intended to allow for a mixed-use transition
zone between the downtown core and future residential uses to the south. The CSO
district will allow a unique mix of land uses designed to serve the commercial and
Article 10 Central Business District (CBD)
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 10 - 12 Article 10
residential needs of the community in an attractive, well-designed, and functional
environment. The district is designed to promote development consistent with the
City of Northville Master Plan, and in a manner which assures quality building
design and site development. It is further designed to regulate the location of
parking, regulate building height to achieve appropriate scale, and encourage the
development of a pedestrian-friendly environment.
b. Uses Permitted by Right: The following uses shall be permitted by right within
the Cady Street Overlay (CSO) district:
1) For properties with underlying CBD or RTD zoning: All permitted uses
within the CBD zoning district as listed in Section 10.02. Also permitted:
First floor multiple-family dwelling units including apartments,
townhouses, and rowhouses and live/work units. However, properties
within the Cady St. Overlay 2 (CSO-2) shall not be allowed first floor
residential units.
2) For properties with underlying PR-1 zoning: All permitted uses within
the CBD zoning district as listed in Section 10.02 and PR-1 zoning district
as listed in Section 13.02. First floor residential units shall not be allowed.
First floor parking garages for upper level residential units may be allowed
but may not occupy more than 50% of the first floor area. The remaining
portion shall be reserved for non-residential uses.
c. Special Land Uses Permitted After Review and Approval:
1) For properties with underlying CBD or RTD zoning: All special land
uses within the CBD zoning district as listed within Section 10.03 shall be
permitted with the exception of boarding houses (rooming houses), subject
to Planning Commission approval.
2) For properties with underlying PR-1 zoning: All special land uses within
the CBD zoning district as listed in Section 10.03 and PR-1 zoning district
as listed in Section 13.02 shall be permitted, subject to Planning
Commission approval.

d. Residential Density: Residential units shall be permitted within the Cady Street
Overlay district at a density of at least fifteen (15) units per net acre for property
fronting on Cady Street, and ten (10) dwelling units per net acre for other properties,
and otherwise governed by dimensional and form-based requirements to ensure new
construction is compatible visually and functionally with surrounding land uses, and
follows the residential density pattern designated within the City of Northville Master
Plan, unless specific site limitations, such as topography, property dimension, traffic,
or other issues warrant a deviation from the Master Plan. First floor residential uses are
not allowed within the Cady St. Overlay 2 (CSO-2) district. On properties within the
underlying PR-1 district, first floor and upper level residential uses are acceptable in
this area as part of a mixed-use project; however, residential-only developments are not
permitted. Single-use buildings that are part of a multi-building, mixed-use
development are also permitted on parcels with underlying PR-1 zoning. (Rev. 5/19)
e. Area, Height, and Placement Requirements for the CSO District: Area, height,
and placement requirements unless otherwise specified are as provided in the following
Table 10-1, and as further provided in Section 15.01, Schedule of Regulations.
Front Yard Setbacks:
The north side of Cady Street shall maintain a zero feet (0)  ten feet (10) front yard
setback. However, first floor residential on the north side shall maintain a ten feet (10)
minimum front setback. The 10-feet (10) minimum front setback for first floor
residential may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission if one or more of
the following design alternatives is incorporated into the project:

Note: See Section 15.01 Schedule of Regulations and footnotes thereto for additional requirements
and regulations.
SECTION 11.05 SEVEN MILE  SOUTH MAIN STREET OVERLAY (SM-O)
(Rev. 4/19)
a. Preamble: It is recognized that the Seven Mile  South Main Street area on the
southern boundary of the City of Northville is unique and requires special zoning
regulations. Parcels within this area create an important entranceway into the City,
and frontage on Seven Mile and South Main Street provide extensive exposure for
commercial development. This area is also unique given its close proximity to the
Wayne County Park system and existing non-motorized trail, providing attractive
amenities. Vacant and underused properties also provide opportunities for growth
and new investment. Because of these and other distinctions, a separate Seven Mile
 South Main Street Overlay (SM-O) district has been created. The SM-O district
addresses special siting, design and compatibility issues that require development
regulations in addition to those found in the underlying zoning districts. When the
standards of the SM-O district conflict with those of the underlying district, the
standards of the SM-O shall govern.
The Seven Mile  South Main Street Overlay district is intended to maintain a
commercial character along both street frontages, but allow for a mixed-use
(commercial and residential) zone that takes advantage of the existing commercial
cluster, as well as the areas adjacency to recreational amenities. The SM-O district
will allow a unique mix of land uses designed to serve the commercial and

residential needs of the community in an attractive, well-designed, and functional
environment. It also allows for current commercial and industrial uses to remain,
but guides redevelopment if proposed. The district is designed to promote
development consistent with the City of Northville Master Plan, and in a manner
which assures quality building design and site development. It is further designed
to regulate the location of parking, regulate building height to achieve appropriate
scale, and encourage the development of a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly
environment.
b. Uses Permitted by Right: The following uses shall be permitted by right within
the Seven Mile  South Main Street (SM-O) district:
1) All permitted uses within the General Commercial District (GCD) zoning
district as listed in Section 11.02 except for large-format (over 55,000
square feet) retail and strip commercial uses.
2) Also permitted: Single-family residential uses abutting the Wayne County
Park and first floor multiple-family dwelling units including apartments,
townhouses, rowhouses, and live/work units. Residential uses shall not be
located along the Seven Mile and South Main Street frontages unless part
of a mixed-use project that has commercial on the first floor and residential
above.
c. Special Land Uses Permitted After Review and Approval: Subject to Planning
Commission approval, all special land uses within the GCD zoning district as listed
within Section 11.03 are permitted except for vehicle sales, repair and wash uses,
truck or trailer rental, and gas stations. Outdoor storage, as defined by this
ordinance, is also not permitted unless it meets the following standards.
1) The standards listed in Section 16.11.
2) Any outdoor storage shall be located only in a side or rear yard. No storage
shall be located in the front (street) side of the building.
3) Outdoor storage of all materials, whether enclosed in containers or
unenclosed, shall be screened from view of a street or other publically
accessible area. Outdoor storage shall also be screened from view from a
residentially zoned or used property.
4) Screening shall consist of a masonry wall or landscape screen, at the
discretion of the Planning Commission who shall determine which is the
most effective and appropriate screening method. If materials are enclosed
in a container(s) of any sort, including shipping containers, the container(s)
shall not be considered screening under this provision. The masonry or
landscape screen shall be at least one (1) foot taller than the materials stored,
Article 11 General Commercial District (GCD)

SECTION 15.02 FOOTNOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS
1. A public water supply and sanitary sewer system shall be available.
2. There shall be a front yard on each public street or private road side of a corner lot. No
accessory building shall project beyond the front yard line on either street.
3. All required yards not used for accessory buildings and access driveways or sidewalks shall
be landscaped.
4. Lot area coverage applies to all main and accessory buildings and structures. For the
purposes of this section, in-ground or at-grade structures are not structures for computing
allowable lot coverage.
5. Height provisions shall not apply to hospitals, universities, colleges and similar institutions
of higher learning. Unless otherwise provided, one (1) foot of additional setback over and above
the minimum height therein established shall be provided for each five (5) foot increase in height.
6. In R-3 Third Density Residential District, for residential uses other than Assisted Senior
Living Facility, Congregate Care Retirement Community, or Convalescent/Nursing/Memory
Care Facility, the total number of rooms of eighty (80) square feet or more (not including kitchen
and sanitary facilities) shall not be more than the area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by
sixteen hundred (1600). All units shall have at least one (1) living room and one (1) bedroom and
there shall be not more than ten (10) percent of the units of an efficiency apartment type.
For the purposes of computing the permitted number of rooms in excess of eighty (80) square feet
or more and the number of dwelling units per acre the following room assignments shall determine
the room characteristics of the dwelling unit.
One Bedroom - 2 rooms Plans presented showing 1, 2, or 3 bedroom
Two Bedrooms - 3 rooms units and including a den, library or other
Three Bedrooms - 4 rooms extra rooms shall count such extra rooms as a
Four Bedrooms - 5 rooms bedroom for the purpose or computing density.
In R-3 District, the area used for computing density shall be the total site area exclusive of any
dedicated public right-of-way, either interior or bounding roads.
In R-3, R-4 Forth Density Residential District and PBO Professional and Business Office
District, for Assisted Senior Living Facility, Congregate Care Retirement Community, or
Convalescent/Nursing/Memory Care Facility, density and unit configurations are defined in
Section 15.02 (Footnote 15), Section 5.02 and 16.17 through 16.18. (Rev. 5/18)
7. In an R-3 or R-4 District, front, side or rear yards need not refer to spacing between
buildings for a planned development in cases of two (2) or more buildings on the same parcel. In
such cases, the minimum distance between any two (2) buildings shall be regulated according to
Article 15 Schedule of Regulations
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 15 - 4 Article 15
the length and height of such building. Planned Unit Development when permitted in the R-1A
District is likewise subject to the formula described as follows:
In all R Districts the formula for regulating the required minimum distance between two (2)
buildings is as described in the following diagram with explanation thereto.
S = LA + LB + 2 (HA + HB)
-------------------------
6
Where:
S = Required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A and any wall of
building B or the vertical prolongation of either.
LA = Total length of building A.
The total length of building A is the length of that portion or portions of a wall or walls or
building A from which, when viewed directly from above, lines drawn perpendicular to
building A will intersect any wall of building B.
LB = Total length of building B.
The total length or building B is the length of that portion or portions of a wall or walls of
building B from which, when viewed directly from above, the lines drawn perpendicular to
building B will intersect any wall or building A.
HA = Height of building A.
The height of building A at any given level is the height above natural grade level of any
portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length or building A. Natural grade level shall
be the mean level of the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or
walls along the total length of the building.
HB = Height of building B.
The height or building B at any given level is the height above natural grade level or any
portion or portions of a wall or walls along the length or building B. Natural grade level shall
be the mean level of the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of the wall or
walls along the total length of the building.

(At least 200 sq. ft. with 4'-6" clear height)
(When mezzanine exceeds sixty-six (66) percent of area of floor below it, mezzanine shall be
considered a full story)
Article 15 Schedule of Regulations
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 15 - 6 Article 15
8. In the R-4 District the following alternate formula shall apply where this formula produces
a greater front, side and rear yard requirement. In any event this formula applies in the
determination of front, side and rear yards for residential structures exceeding a height of three (3)
stories.
Yard widths shall be based upon a basic figure of 0.6 times the height or length of a wall facing
any property line, whichever is the greater, with the exception of the following variation;
Front Yards or pavable frontage lot: The above basic figure minus the lesser of one-half (1/2) the
width of the road or thirty-three (33) feet, with a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet (e.g., a building
one hundred (100) feet long and one hundred (100) feet high would require front yard of sixty (60)
feet minus thirty-three (33) feet in the event the building fronts on a public street sixty-six (66)
feet wide, or twenty-seven (27) feet which is more than the minimum).
Rear and Sideyards: Rear and side yards may be reduced to a minimum of one half (1/2) the length
or height of the building whichever is the lessor in the event or walls without windows to habitable
rooms.
9. Bonus provisions provide that the maximum FAR may be increased by a factor of 0.25 or
twenty-five (25) percent in the event the development provides for various aesthetic
embellishments such as abstract artifacts and other types of streetscape, to include but not limited
to sculpture, fountains, plazas and other architecturally and aesthetically producing improvements
when said improvement is the equivalent of a minimum value of ten (10) percent of the estimated
project cost.
10. No side yards are required along the side lot lines of the district, except as otherwise
specified in the Building Code or as described below. However, if walls of structures facing such
side lot lines contain windows or other openings, side yards of not less than ten (10) feet in width
shall be provided. (Rev. 4/17)
11. On a lot which has a side yard abutting a residential district, there shall be provided a
setback of ten (10) feet in width from the residential property. (Rev. 4/17)
12. The purpose of the rear-yard setback is to provide a service and delivery alley along the
common rear lot line of CBD properties which back up to each other. The Planning Commission
may modify or waive the rear-yard requirement when the property being developed backs up to a
public parking lot or public right-of-way, or in instances where the requirement of the rear yard
setback would serve no useful purpose.
13. Except for the main spectator stadium which shall not exceed a height of forty (40) feet,
no other building or structure shall exceed a height of twenty (20) feet.
14. No building or structure accessory to the Racetrack shall be situated within twenty (20)
feet of any existing residential use and no stable shall be situated within one hundred (100) feet of
any residential zone district.
15. In each of the residential zoning districts, no dwelling unit may occupy less than the space
herein provided as follows: (Rev. 5/18)

Article 16 Special Uses
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 16 - 1 Article 16
ARTICLE 16
SPECIAL USES
SECTION 16.01 SPECIAL USES
a. Intent and Purpose
Special land uses are considered to be more intense, or potentially more disruptive,
compared to the various uses in a particular Zoning District which are permitted
by right. The uses classified as special land uses vary by District and are listed in
the regulations of each Zoning District. These provisions encourage cooperation
and consultation between the City and the applicant to facilitate development in
accordance with the Citys land use objectives. An approved special land use shall
be considered a conforming use permitted in the District at the specific site where
it is located. The procedures and standards set forth herein are intended to:
 Accommodate uses which are needed and beneficial to the City while at the
same time carefully considering and minimizing their potential impacts.
 Provide a consistent and uniform method for review for proposed special
land uses.
 Provide a mechanism for public input on decisions involving more intensive
land uses.
 Regulate the use of land operations and site design based on the
characteristics of a particular use.
 Provide site design and operational standards to minimize any negative
impact on adjoining or nearby properties.
 Establish procedures for expansion or change in a special land use which
has received special land use approval and/or those which existed prior to
the adoption of special land use review procedures. (Rev. 8/06)
b. Application.
Applications for special use permits authorized in this Ordinance shall be submitted
to the Building Department on a form provided by the City. In addition to a
complete application form, the applicant is required to submit a preliminary site
plan prepared in accordance with Article 19, Site Plan Review. The preliminary
site plan shall be considered by the Planning Commission during deliberations
regarding both the special use application and preliminary site plan review.
Article 16 Special Uses
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 16 - 2 Article 16
For a use or building that involves more than one activity classified as a special
land use, a separate special land use permit may be required for each use. Special
land use review shall be required for expansion of a use that is classified as a special
use but has not received a prior special land use approval. (Rev. 5/18)
c. Procedures.
1) The Building Official or designee shall review the proposed application and
site plan to determine if all required information has been supplied, and
forward the completed application, site plan, and supporting data to the City
Planning Commission.
2) Upon receipt of the application for a special use permit, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the notification
requirements described hereafter.
A notice of the public hearing shall be published in at least one (1)
newspaper of general circulation and sent by mail or personal delivery to all
persons to whom real property is assessed within three hundred (300) feet
of the boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all
structures within three hundred (300) feet regardless of whether the property
or occupant is located in the zoning jurisdiction. If the name of the occupant
is not known, the term occupant may be used in making notification.
(Rev. 12/06)
The notice shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the date the
application will be considered. The notice shall describe the property in
question and the nature of the special use permit request; state the time, date,
and location of the public hearing; and, indicate when and where written
comments will be received concerning the request. The notice shall include
a listing of all existing street addresses within the property. Street addresses
do not need to be created and listed if no such addresses currently exist
within the property. If there are no street addresses, other means of
identification may be used. (Rev. 12/06)
3) Upon conclusion of the public hearing procedures, and after consideration
of the Basis of Determination and the standards of preliminary site plan
review, the Planning Commission may deny, approve, approve with
conditions, or refer back to the applicant a request for special land use
approval. The decision on a special land use shall be incorporated in a
statement of findings and conclusions relative to the special land use which
specifies the basis for the decision and any conditions imposed. (Rev.
12/06)
Article 16 Special Uses
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 16 - 3 Article 16
d. Basis of Determinations.
The special use request shall meet all of the standards listed below.
1. Compatibility with the Master Plan. The proposed special land use shall be
compatible with and in accordance with the general principles and
objectives of the City of Northvilles Master Plan.
2. Compliance with Zoning Ordinance standards. The proposed special land
use shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to meet the
stated intent of the zoning district as well as compliance with standards for
preliminary site plan review.
3. Compatibility with adjacent uses
The proposed special land use shall be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained to be compatible with existing or planned uses on surrounding
land. In determining whether a special land use will be compatible and not
create a significant detrimental impact, as compared to the impacts of
permitted uses, consideration shall be given to the degree of impact the
special land use may have on adjacent property, as compared with the
expected value to the community. The following types of impact shall be
considered:
a. Use activities, processes, materials, equipment or conditions of
operation relative to public views and adjacent land uses.
b. Location of vehicular circulation and parking areas.
c. Location of outdoor activity, storage and work areas.
d. The location and height of proposed buildings and structures.
e. Hours of operation.
f. Production of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes, odors, dust,
glare and light.
g. Impacts on adjacent property values.
h. Relative ease by which the impacts above will be mitigated.
4. Impact of traffic
a. The location and design of the proposed special land use shall
minimize the negative impacts on the street system in consideration
Article 16 Special Uses
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 16 - 4 Article 16
of items such as vehicle trip generation (i.e. volumes), types of
traffic, access location and design, location of off-street parking,
street capacity, traffic operations at proposed access points and
traffic operations at nearby intersections.
b. The City may require mitigation to maintain the pre-existing traffic
operations
c. Route and operational restrictions (such as hours, cleaning of dust
or debris) may be established for construction traffic to minimize
negative impacts.
d. A traffic impact study, prepared by a qualified traffic professional,
may be required in accordance with Section 19.05j.
5. Impact of the environment
The proposed special land use shall not have an adverse effect on the quality
of the natural environment in comparison to the impacts associated with
typical permitted uses. The Planning Commission may require a
quantitative comparison of the impacts of typical permitted uses and the
special land use to assist in making this determination (such as an overlay
of development plans, on a natural features map, illustrating other site
development options to demonstrate the impacts have been minimized to
the extent practical). If the cumulative impact creates or contributes to a
significant environmental problem, mitigation shall be provided to alleviate
the impacts associated with the requested use (i.e. ensure the end result is at
least similar to the pre-existing conditions.).
6. Public Services
The proposed special land use shall be located where it can be adequately
served by essential public facilities and services, such as streets, pedestrian

Proposed lease agreements or other similar contractual agreements (Collective Use Parking
Agreements) between collective parking entities may be considered by the Planning Commission
and shall be reviewed by the City Attorney. A Collective Use Parking Agreement shall contain a
provision that indicates that the Collective Use Parking Agreement shall be in effect for at least
five (5) years. After five (5) years, the Collective Use Parking Agreement will be subject to review
for renewal by the Planning Commission and the City Attorney. Any such Collective Use Parking
Agreement must be reviewed, renewed, and approved every five (5) years by the Planning
Commission after review by the City Attorney. In the event that the Collective Use Parking
Agreement is terminated for any reason or is not renewed by the Planning Commission, the parties
must inform the City, and the entities covered by the Collective Use Parking Agreement will then
have to either enter into another Collective Use Parking Agreement, provide the required parking
pursuant to the Parking Ordinance, or purchase parking credits, in accordance with Section 17.03.

c. Shared Parking within the CBD
Shared parking within the CBD may be considered for neighboring uses (within 400 feet, measured
from the perimeter of a building or perimeter of a lot held in ownership or control or a municipal
lot) based upon the fact that certain uses may operate at different times over a 24-hour period with
the greatest demand for parking occurring during different times. The Planning Commission may
require that applicants submit parking studies and / or documentation on parking use. The total
number of combined spaces required for one or more use may be reduced by up to thirty (30)
percent from the aforementioned chart (17.01.13.a). This reduction shall be recommended by the
Planning Commission and considered by the City Council and shall be based upon the following
factors:
1. The peak hours of operation for each use.
2. The average parking demand and the peak parking demand for each use, based on
reliable data. Such data will include actual parking counts for these uses, or if
similar uses or actual parking counts are not available, reliable traffic / parking
demand models may be used.
3. The impact of the shared parking arrangement on adjacent uses.
4. Written legal evidence of a Shared Parking Agreement which, if recommended by
the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council, must be recorded on
all affected land titles with the County Register of Deeds.
Proposed lease agreements or other similar contractual agreements (Shared Parking
Agreements) between shared parking entities may be considered by the Planning Commission
and City Council and shall be reviewed by the City Attorney. A Shared Parking Agreement should
contain a provision that indicates that the lease shall be in effect for at least five (5) years. After
five (5) years, the Shared Parking Agreement will be subject to review for renewal by the City
Council and the City Attorney. Any such Shared Parking Agreement must be reviewed, renewed,
and approved every five (5) years by the City Council after review by the City Attorney. In the
event that the Shared Parking Agreement is terminated for any reason or is not renewed by the
City Council, the parties must inform the City, and the entities covered by the Shared Parking
Agreement will then have to either enter into another Shared Parking Agreement, provide the
required parking pursuant to the Parking Ordinance, or purchase parking credits, in accordance
with Section 17.03.
Once the Shared Parking Agreement is approved by the City Council, the Agreement shall be
recorded on the land titles for all affected properties with the County Register of Deeds. The
Agreement shall not be cancelled by either party without twelve (12) months written notice to any
and all parties to the Agreement, any entities affected by the Agreement, and to the City of
Northville.

City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 17 - 7 Article 17
In the event of a change of use or other change of parking configuration or termination of the
Shared Use Parking Agreement for any reason, each use shall be reviewed for parking compliance
and shall be subject to the requirements of this Article. A site which fails to provide necessary
parking shall be in violation of Article 24 of the Zoning Ordinance and shall be subject to
enforcement action by the City.
d. CBD/Mixed Use Parking
For mixed use projects within the CBD, the Planning Commission may recommend and the City
Council may consider a reduction in parking from Section 17.01.13a subject to the following
criteria:
1. Application. The City may authorize a reduction in the total number of required
parking spaces for two or more uses jointly providing on-site parking subject to the
following criteria:
(i) The respective hours of operation of the uses may overlap, as demonstrated
by the following Table (Schedule of Mixed Use Parking Calculations). If
one or all of the land uses proposing to use joint parking facilities do not
conform to one of the general land use classifications, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data to indicate that there is not substantial conflict in the
principal operating hours of the uses. Such data may include information
from a professional publication such as those published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE), the Urban Land Institute (ULI), or by a
professionally prepared parking study.
(ii) A Parking Plan shall be submitted for approval which shall show the layout
of proposed parking based on City of Northville zoning standards.
2. Calculation. The applicant shall calculate the number of spaces required for each
use if it were free-standing (with no application of this program). The applicable
general land use category to each proposed use shall be applied, as well as the
percentages to calculate the number of spaces required for each time. The table
provided below shall be used for the calculations. The applicant shall add the
number of spaces required for all applicable land uses to obtain a total parking
requirement for each time period. The time period with the highest total parking
requirement and use shall be the mixed use parking requirement. The Planning
Commission may require that the applicant submit parking studies and/or
documentation on parking use, anticipated schedule for shared parking, peak hour
demand, or adequacy of parking spaces. These studies, together with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, will be forwarded to the City
Council.

SECTION 17.03 CASH IN LIEU OF PARKING OR SPECIALLY PROVIDED PARKING
ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CBD
In the interest of creating a viable central business district and to enhance the goal of separation of
pedestrian and vehicular requirements, it is the goal of the City of Northville to encourage the
development of strategically located parking lots, developed largely out of public support rather
than encourage the indiscriminate location of small dysfunctional parking spaces much to the
detriment of creating a compatible and aesthetic arrangement of land uses. In keeping with this
policy, the provision of off-street parking requirements as herein provided shall not be required of
individual developers on land which they hold in fee simple, with the consent of the Council.
In lieu thereof, the City Council may determine that the number of spaces normally required at the
time of erection or enlargement of any building or structure requiring off-street parking space
pursuant to Section 17.02, shall be provided in the form of an amount of cash according to policy
established by resolution of the City Council. In establishing such policy, the City Council shall
take into account the current inventory and future needs of CBD parking, the method by which
actual parking shall be provided through such cash payments in lieu of parking, and the amount of
cash which shall be contributed in lieu of parking, taking into account the benefit to the private
owners and to the public from such parking which would subsequently be provided by the city. In
implementing such policy, the City Council shall assure that the future needs for parking in the
CBD shall be adequately met by such cash payments in lieu of parking.
A determination of the number of spaces normally required shall be based on Section 17.02
Required Off-Street Parking Spaces.

SECTION 17.04 OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE LAYOUT, STANDARDS,
CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE
Wherever off-street parking requirements as provided above in Section 17.02 require the building
of an off-street parking facility, such off-street parking lots shall be laid out, constructed and
maintained in accordance with the following standards and regulations:
a. No parking lot shall be constructed unless and until a permit is issued by the Chief
Enforcement Officer. Applications for a permit shall be submitted to the Chief
Enforcement officer in such form as may be determined by the Chief Enforcement
Officer and shall be accompanied with two (2) sets or plans for the development
and construction of the parking lot showing that the provisions of this Section will
be fully complied with.
b. Plans for the layout of off-street parking facilities shall be in accord with the

The above is graphically illustrated on the following pages.
c. All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes,
except in the Central Business District with approved attendant parking. Attendant
parking is defined as the use of an off street area whereon parking of vehicles is
permitted in a pattern which does not meet the minimum parking space
requirement. Maneuvering lane and access drive dimensions as set forth in this
ordinance because an attendant is provided to direct vehicles while parking may be
modified.
Article 17 Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 17 - 16 Article 17
Approval of attendant parking use must be obtained from the Planning Commission
as part of the Site Development Plan approval process. Attendant parking shall be
permitted only in connection with the operation of a commercial parking lot or in
connection with the operation of a business, or activity, which has peak operating
periods, as defined by the Planning Commission, such as restaurants, dining
lounges, etc., and any permit for the use of attendant parking shall be conditioned
upon the applicant's agreement that he shall have a person, or persons employed
whose principal duty during peak operating periods is to park and retrieve
automobiles for customers of applicant's business and further that the granting of a
permit for attendant parking will not have an adverse effect upon neighboring
business, or their parking facilities.
The definition of Peak Operating Periods shall be made a part of the Site
Development Plan approval and shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission if
there is a change in peak operating periods. All attendant parking lots shall have
parking spaces and maneuvering lanes striped in accordance with the standards
provided in this ordinance for non-attendant lots for use when the attendant is not
required to be on duty. In all cases of off street parking the driving of a vehicle
from a parking stall, or a space directly onto a public street is expressly prohibited.
d. Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot by means of clearly limited and
defined drives shall be provided for all vehicles. Ingress and egress to a parking lot
in connection with a non-residential use shall not be located opposite a single family
residential district.
e. Except for parallel parking, all parking spaces shall be clearly striped and
maintained with double lines twenty-four (24) inches apart or single striped lines
to facilitate the orderly alignment of parked vehicles (see diagram entitled Striping
Layout).
f. All maneuvering lane widths shall permit one-way traffic movement except that the
ninety (90) degree pattern may permit two-way movement.
g. Each entrance and exit to and from any off-street parking lot located in an area
zoned for other then single-family residential use shall be situated at least twenty
five (25) feet distance from any adjacent property located in any single-family
residential district.
h. Off-street parking areas shall be provided with a continuous and obscuring wall not
less than four feet six inches (4' 6") in height measured from the surface of the
parking area. This wall shall be provided on all sides where the next zoning district
is designated as a residential district.
When a front yard setback is required, all land between said wall and the front
property line or street right-of-way line shall be kept free from refuse and debris
and shall be landscaped with deciduous shrubs, evergreen material and ornamental

trees. The ground area shall be planted and kept in lawn. All such landscaping and
planting shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition, neat and orderly in
appearance.
i. The entire parking area, including parking spaces and maneuvering lanes, required
under this section, shall be provided with asphaltic or concrete surfacing in
accordance with specifications approved by the City Engineer. The parking area
shall be surfaced within one (1) year of the date the permit is issued.
Off-street parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all surface water
accumulated in the parking areas in such a way as to preclude drainage of water
onto adjacent property.
j. All lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area shall be so installed as to
be confined within and directed onto the parking area only, and shall be of such
intensity as to provide not less than one (1) foot candle of light at any point on the
lot.
k. In all cases where a wall extends to an alley which is a means of ingress and egress
to an off-street parking area, it shall be permissible to end the wall not more then
ten (10) feet from such alley line in order to permit a wider means of access to the
parking area.
l. The Board of Appeals, upon application by the property owner of the off-street
parking area, may modify the yard or wall requirements, where, because of unusual
circumstances, no good purpose would be served by compliance with the
requirements of this Section.

City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 1 Article 19
ARTICLE 19
SITE PLAN PROCEDURAL AND APPROVAL PROCESS
SECTION 19.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for approval authorities and standards for the
review and approval of site plan applications as herein prescribed. This section is further intended
to improve the environmental quality of developments in the City of Northville, to minimize the
possibility that a particular development may have an adverse effect upon adjacent property, and
further to ensure proper relationships between the development features as they relate to: traffic
safety, service roads, driveways, parking areas, accessory buildings and uses, and open spaces. To
these ends, the Planning Commission is hereby empowered by the City Council and is given
authority to establish procedures, standards and administrative rules whereby applicants are
required to submit for approval a site plan to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission, subject
to the provisions herein, prior to the issuance of a building permit. The Planning Commission, or
administrative staff for Minor Site Plans, shall not approve a site plan unless the application for
site plan approval complies with the standards contained within Article 19, additional requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance, as well as all other applicable City, County or State requirements. (Rev.
7/17)
SECTION 19.02 SITE PLAN DEFINED
A site plan means a plan showing the outline of a building and its placement on a parcel of land
with respect to the lot lines which form the parcel, and includes details of physical changes to the
natural topography of the site; proposed pedestrian and vehicular circulation to and on the site;
relationships to adjacent development, characteristics of the building space, including interior and
exterior design; utility connections; methods of site drainage; proposed landscape improvements;
screen buffer areas and advertising signs. (Rev. 7/17)
SECTION 19.03 SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS
a. General Requirements: The Building Official shall not issue a building permit for
the construction or exterior building or site alterations until a site plan describing
the changes has been submitted to the city, as herein described, for review and
approval.
b. Site Plan Review by the Planning Commission: Site plan review by the Planning
Commission shall be required for the following:
1) Development of a site and/or building from a vacant status to active use,
including paving and/or underground structures.
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 2 Article 19
2) Change of use from a non-conforming use to a conforming use or re-use
that is an intensification of use.
3) Any building addition, exterior building/structure remodeling, or site
alteration that:
a. Increases the size of the area of the building by more than five (5)
percent, or at least 2,500 square feet (whichever is smaller), or
b. Increases the height of an existing building or structure, or adds
more stories (partial or full) to an existing building or structure.
4) Any change of use, building/structure changes, or site alteration that
requires more off-street parking spaces in addition to that already provided,
or impacts the movement of vehicles into or across the site, or adjacent
roadways.
c. Minor Site Plan Administrative Review: Small-scale construction projects or
changes in use or to existing sites that dont qualify for review by the Planning
Commission may require a Minor Site Plan review by the City Manager, Planning
Commission Chair (or his/her designee), and the City Planner. The City Planner, in
concurrence with the City manager and Planning Commission Chair (or his/her
designee), shall determine if a project qualifies for Minor Site Plan review or
Planning Commission review, based on the intensity of the proposed use and
anticipated impacts on adjacent land uses.
In general, projects that qualify for Minor Site Plan review include, but are not
limited to, the following:
1) Any building addition, exterior building/structure remodeling, or exterior
site alteration that increases the size of the area of the building by five (5)
percent or less, or less than 2,500 square feet (whichever is smaller) as long
as the alteration does not:
a. Increase the height of the building or add any stories (full or partial),
or
b. Increase the required off-street parking in addition to that already
provided, or
c. Impact the movement of vehicles into or across the site, or adjacent
roadways;
2) Structural changes and additions to meet barrier-free requirements;
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 3 Article 19
3) Accessory buildings and structures for other than single- or two-family
residential uses;
4) Site improvements, other than to parking areas or underground structures,
that meet ordinance standards; or
5) Other similar building or site modifications that are deemed a minor
intensification of use, and/or will only have minor anticipated impacts on
adjacent land uses.
d. Exceptions To Site Plan Review by the Planning Commission or Administrative
Staff: Select projects are exempt from site plan review given their relatively low
level of impact on adjacent land uses, and given that compliance with applicable
building and fire codes and zoning regulations can be addressed during the building
permit review process. A site plan review shall not be required by either the
Planning Commission or administrative staff (for Minor Site Plans) for the
following:
1) One family and two family detached dwelling units and related accessory
buildings.
2) Any change from one conforming use to another conforming use which
does not require off-street parking in addition to that already provided, or
will have no impact on the movement of vehicles into or across the site, or
adjacent roadways.
3) Any building addition, exterior remodeling or exterior alteration which does
not meet the standards for Planning Commission or administrative staff (for
Minor Site Plan) review, as determined by the City Manager, Planning
Commission Chair (or his/her designee) and the City Planner.
4) These exceptions do not eliminate the requirement for review of plans by
the Historic District commission for exterior alterations to buildings within
the Historic District.
e. Impact of Development on Entire Site: In the event a change of use and/or a
building addition effects the intensity of the entire site area, over and above the
previous land use activity, the Planning Commission may apply the review
requirements and standards to the entire site area for purposes of ingress and egress,
landscaping and screening.
f. Payments in Lieu of Parking in the Central Business District: The payment for
parking space credits under Section 17.03 in lieu of providing required off-street
parking spaces shall not affect the requirement for site plan review and approval.

distribute the plans to the City Manager, the Planning Commission Chair
(or his/her designee), and City Staff for administrative review. The
applicant shall receive the reviews, and conclusions of the review process,
in writing. The administrative review may approve, approve with
conditions, refer back for modification, or disapprove the Minor Site Plan.
The administrative review will provide the applicant with findings of fact
or reasons which justify refer back or disapproval of the Minor Site plan.
a. If a Minor Site Plan approval is not granted administratively for any
reason, then the applicant shall submit a new application for site plan
review by the Planning Commission, per the requirements of
19.04.3 to continue in the process.
c. Should the applicant disagree with the findings of the City Planner, he may request
in writing that the site plan as submitted be forwarded to the Planning Commission
for a determination by the Planning Commission.
Section 19.04.3 Preliminary and Final Site Plan Review by the Planning Commission
The site plan approval process may be a two-phased process if requested by the applicant. The
process shall include a preliminary site plan and a final site plan.
a. Preliminary Site Plan: The purpose of a preliminary site plan is to permit the
applicant to obtain basic agreement regarding the most optimum location of a
building(s), points of ingress and egress to the site, and an indication of other likely
improvements necessary to facilitate preparation of the final plan. At this stage,
details of landscaping, site grading, drainage, etc., are not required unless
concurrent preliminary and final site plan approval is requested.
The preliminary site plan will first be submitted to the City Planner who shall make
every attempt to assure that the application is appropriately drawn to scale, and
shall contain all the basic requirements and required items of information as
stipulated within the City's Site Plan Review Checklist (Appendix D). All required
items of information shall be provided unless waived by the Planning Commission.
The City Planner will place the preliminary plan on the agenda of the Planning
Commission as soon as all requirements are met and will make a recommendation
to the Commission regarding the resolution of the plan's acceptability.
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 6 Article 19
The Planning Commission may approve, approve with conditions, refer back for
modification, or disapprove the preliminary site plan. The Planning Commission
will provide the applicant with findings of fact or reasons which justify a motion to
refer back or disapprove a site plan application. Section 19.09 describes expiration
or extension of preliminary site plan approval.
Should the Planning Commission decide to disapprove the site plan, it shall set
forth in the motion of disapproval findings of fact and revisions to the plan the
applicant must take to obtain approval of the Planning Commission.
b. Final Site Plan: Following approval of a preliminary site plan, the applicant may
submit a final site plan to the City Planner. The City Planner shall review the plan
for consistency with the approved preliminary site plan and those matters of further
detail required by the final site plan approval phase.
Where the City Planner is satisfied that the final site plan is consistent with the
provisions of this section and the administrative rules of the Planning Commission,
he/she shall place the final site plan on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission. The City Planner shall make a written
recommendation to the Planning Commission regarding the resolution of the plan's
acceptability. The Planning Commission may approve, approve with conditions,
refer back for modification, or disapprove the final site plan. Section 19.09
describes expiration or extension of final site plan approval.
Should the Planning Commission decide to disapprove the site plan, it shall set
forth in the motion of disapproval findings of fact and revisions to the plan the
applicant must take to obtain approval of the Planning Commission.
Section 19.04.4 Outside Review Agencies
Should a review of the site plan be necessary by State, Wayne or Oakland County Agencies, it will
be the responsibility of the applicant to consult these agencies and return a copy of their review of
the plan to the City Planner. (Rev. 7/17)
SECTION 19.05 SITE PLAN STANDARDS
In the process of review for approval and/or approved with conditions, the City Planner (Minor
Site Plans) and/or the Planning Commission shall apply the following design standards and
criteria. The Planning Commission's and the City Planner's decision to approve, approve with
conditions, refer back for modification, or disapprove will be based upon both the definitive and
subjective guidelines described below.
Adequate documentation in the form of plans and specifications sufficient for the City Planner
(Minor Site Plans) and/or the Planning Commission to address the standards contained herein shall
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 7 Article 19
be included on the plans. Generally, the specific level of information required is indicated on the
site plan application form and checklist which will be provided each applicant and the adopted
administrative rules of the Planning Commission. Failure to adequately prepare site plans
containing the level of information required by each application phase will result in the submitted
material being returned to the applicant for revision and resubmittal. (Rev. 7/17)
In order to describe the design standards, guidelines and criteria, and for ease of interpretation and
finding, they are given categorical and functional arrangement, and are described as follows:
a. Building Arrangement(s).

structure(s) on the project site and adjacent to the site, taking into account
such features as scale and design compatibility should be clearly illustrated.
The measured distance of all buildings between one another and to all lot
lines shall be shown on the site plan.
2) Where more than one (1) building is intended for a site, the plans will show
the relationship of one (1) building to another, and take into account such
features as scale and design compatibility, circulation of light and air,
provision of adequate access to and around buildings for fire and police
protection services, establishment of pleasant vistas, and arrangements
conducive to enhancing the environmental quality of the site when
developed minimizing the extent of impervious ground cover and

the invert of the public storm drain is sufficient to provide an adequate
gravity flow condition.
i. Landscape Improvements And Screening.
1) The applicant shall submit a landscape plan either as a separate sheet or
included with other site plan maps. Appropriate landscaping standards are
established as follows:
(a) Wherever by the terms of the zoning ordinance, a greenbelt
separation area is required between the right-of-way property line
and the nearest portion of any off-street parking area, said area shall
be minimally landscaped as follows:
(i) One (1) tree for each fifty (50) lineal feet, or fraction thereof,
of required greenbelt separation area (including driveways).
Such trees shall be located between the abutting right-of-way
and the off-street parking area or vehicular use area.
(ii) In addition, a hedge, wall or berm, or other landscape
elements with a vertical rise or at least three (3) feet shall be
developed within said separation zone. The hedge, wall or
berm shall have the effect of reducing the visual effect of
parked cars. If the developer decides to construct a masonry
wall, he shall in addition plant one (1) shrub or vine for each
ten (10) lineal feet of masonry wall on the street side of the
wall.
(iii) The remainder of the required landscaped separation area
shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other
landscape treatment, excluding paving such as concrete or

described in Section 18.08 shall install and maintain a landscape
buffer, except as otherwise provided for a masonry wall of at least
ten (10) feet in width or as otherwise required in the zoning
ordinance. In the event two (2) or more parcels of land are being
developed simultaneously, the developer who submits his site plan
later shall be deemed the latest developer, provided however, that
nothing herein contained shall prevent two (2) or more developers
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 11 Article 19
from agreeing upon a method of providing buffer landscaping in
conformity with these rules. Such a landscape buffer shall be
located along the common lot line and shall be designed to provide
eighty (80) percent or more continuing summer opacity two (2)
years after planting and sixty (60) percent winter opacity when
viewed from two (2) to eight (8) feet above ground level.
(b) A minimum of one (1) tree shall be provided for each forty (40)
lineal feet of such landscape or fraction thereof. Such trees shall be
located between the common lot line and use area within the ten (10)
foot buffer area.
(c) If, at the discretion of the developer, a masonry wall is determined
to be the preferential buffer device, the developer shall in addition
to the masonry wall plant one (1) shrub or vine abutting the wall for
each ten (10) lineal feet of masonry wall.
3) Whenever under the terms of the zoning ordinance, a developer is required
to construct a parking lot and/or vehicular use area, the following landscape
requirements shall apply:
(a) Off-street parking and/or vehicular use areas shall have one and onehalf
(1 ½) square feet of landscape area for each one hundred (100)
square feet, or fraction thereof, of paved area for the first fifty
thousand (50,000) square feet of paved area, plus one (1) square foot
of landscaped area for each one hundred (100) square feet of paved
area, or fraction thereof, of all paved area over fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet. Landscaped space required as a buffer planting
area or separation space between the public right-of-way and the
vehicular use area cannot be considered as vehicular use landscape
area.
(b) Interior landscaped areas shall be no less than fifteen (15) square
feet and shall have a minimum dimension of at least three (3) feet
and shall be adequately landscaped. Authorized landscaping
material, excepting trees, shall be maintained so as not to exceed
three (3) feet in height. The total number of trees shall not be less
then one (1) for each one hundred (100) square feet, or fraction
thereof of required interior landscaped area.
(c) Interior landscaped areas are intended to break up the expanse of
paving. Interior landscaped areas may be combined when they serve
the purpose of an on-site drainage retention area.
(d) A vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped area when
said area is protected by wheel stops or curbing so that the wheels
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 12 Article 19
of a motor vehicle cannot be stationed on required landscaped
areas.
4) Dumpsters and enclosures shall be prohibited within the required or nonrequired
front yard and shall be located in the side or rear yard area.
Dumpsters shall comply with the side and rear setback requirements for the
district in which they are located.
Refuse collection receptacles shall be screened from view from a public
street. The screening shall be of live landscape material such as, but not
limited, to trees, shrubs and hedges, and shall provide eighty (80) percent
or more summer opacity and sixty (60) percent winter opacity within two
(2) years when viewed from between two (2) and ten (10) feet above ground
level. The height of the dumpster enclosure shall be at least one (1) foot
higher than the dumpster in use.
Wood fencing or masonry walls may be used to screen trash receptacle areas
in conjunction with one (1) vine which adheres to the fence or wall and
planted every ten (10) lineal feet along said wood fence or wall.
The Planning Commission may waive the requirements for a dumpster or
modify the location of dumpsters and the dumpster enclosure design subject
to site characteristics including building orientation, site circulation, and
screening. (Rev. 12/05)
5) The Planning Commission may alter the total landscaping plan if it can
show cause, and particularly may require additional planting material when
said planting is to facilitate a visual screen or to block the transmission of
noise, fumes, erosion or other matter which may be objectionable to the
public.
6) The plans as submitted and approved shall not be otherwise modified
unless, after application for reconsideration the Planning Commission
agrees, to such modifications. Failure to comply with the approved plan
will result in a withholding of the occupancy permit.
7) In conjunction with the site plan review procedures of Article 19, a site plan
shall include plans for compliance with the Citys Tree Preservation
Ordinance (City Code Chapter 90, Article II). (Rev. 12/05)

j. Traffic Impact Study (Rev. 12/05)
1. Traffic Impact Study  The Planning Commission will require a traffic
impact study for a PUD, site plan, rezoning or special use, if either or both
of the following situations occur:
a. Proposed development which generates one hundred (100) or more
directional vehicle trips (in bound or outbound) during the peak
hour.
b. Proposed development which in the opinion of the City Engineer
will generate significant traffic volumes, cause traffic safety
concerns, or create burdens on the existing roadway network of the
City.
2. Minimum Contents of Traffic Impact Study
a. The following shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission
who shall review and determine the applicability and/or necessity of
the following items as they pertain to a specific development or
rezoning request.
i. Existing conditions including existing daily and peak hour
traffic volumes on adjacent street(s). Intersections in the
vicinity which are expected to be impacted as identified by
the City and a description of any site distance limitations
along the sites right-of-way frontage. Existing traffic
counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday
of non-holiday weeks. Additional counts (i.e. on a Saturday
for a proposed commercial development) may also be
required in some cases. The following times/situations
should also be avoided where possible so that the traffic
count data would represent a typical day: construction
detours in the area, summer days for a site near a school, etc.
The consultant performing the impact study must make
every effort to complete traffic counts during average or
higher than average volume conditions (i.e. regarding
weather or seasonal variations) for the area under study.
Traffic data over one (1) year old will not be accepted unless
the applicant can document that volumes have not changed
more than two (2) percent.
ii. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m.
and p.m. peak hour and average daily traffic generated. The
forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined
in the most recent Institute for Traffic Engineers Trip

of the existing intersection capacity and/or for roadways sections
and intersections experiencing congestion or a relatively high
accident rate.
d. Traffic accident data covering the most recent three (3) years for
intersections analyzed in the impact Study shall be summarized in
collision diagrams. The City may require traffic accident data if the
segment of roadway adjacent to or near the subject site has
experienced accident problems.
e. A map and description of the location and design of proposed access
(driveway or new street intersection), including any sight distance
limitations, dimensions from adjacent driveways and intersections
within two-hundred-fifty (250) feet, other data to demonstrate that
the design and number of driveways proposed is the fewest
necessary, and the driveway(s) will provide safe and efficient traffic
operation and be in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.
f. An analysis of the potential need for bypass lanes or deceleration
tapers/lanes including attachment of any correspondence by the
County.
g. A general description and illustration with arrows of internal site

determination by the City Engineer that the proposed development
will have minimal impact on the Citys street system. (Rev. 12/05)
SECTION 19.06 FINANCIAL GUARANTEES
In the event a temporary certification of occupancy is obtained pursuant to Article 24, adequate
financial guarantees shall be posted to cover the costs of incomplete improvements.
SECTION 19.07 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The Planning Commission may require the applicant to prepare and submit an environmental
analysis of the potential and probable impacts of the project if established. Said environmental
review will include an analysis of the physical, natural and biological elements that will or may be
changed by the project. The review shall be made by persons qualified to conduct such reviews
and who have no conflict of interest in the matter. The Planning Commission shall require the
applicant to mitigate adverse environmental impacts as part or the development.
SECTION 19.08 PLAN REVIEW TIME
The Planning Commission or the City Planner (Minor Site Plan) shall within forty-five (45) days
advise the applicant and Building Official that the plans as submitted are approved, or are
conditionally approved, provided the modifications as specified by the Planning Commission or
during administrative review in its communication are accepted by the developer and the plans are
so modified. In the event of disapproval, the Planning Commission or City Planner shall state
conditions for approval in a communication to the developer and the Building Official. (Rev. 7/17)
SECTION 19.09 EXPIRATION OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL SITE PLAN
APPROVALS

in writing before the approval expires, and shall include a statement of why the extension is
Article 19 Site Plan Procedural and Approval Process
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 16 Article 19
necessary and confirmation of ability to submit a final site plan. For phased plans, if a final site
plan is submitted for only a part of the area included in the approved preliminary site plan,
successive final site plans shall be filed at intervals no greater than three (3) years from the date of
approval of the previously approved final site plan.
Final site plan approval, whether granted by the Planning Commission or as a result of a Minor
Site Plan review, is valid for a period of one year from the date of Planning Commission or
administrative action within which time all necessary Building or Construction Permits shall be
secured and construction substantially commenced. The Planning Commission may grant an
extension on final site plan approval for up to one year. This shall apply to all approvals, whether
granted by the Planning Commission or administratively. All requests for extensions shall be made
in writing before approval expires and include a statement of why the extension is necessary and
confirmation of ability to complete construction in conformity with the final site plan as approved.
For phased plans, if a final site plan is submitted for only a part of the area included in the approved
preliminary site plan, successive final site plans shall be filed at intervals no greater than three (3)
years from the date of approval of the previously approved final site plan. If such period is
exceeded, the Planning Commission may declare the approved preliminary site plan invalid with
respect to the remaining parts of the site, unless good cause can be shown for the development
schedule. In such case the Planning Commission may require that the site plan be revised to meet
current ordinance requirements. (Rev. 7/17)

the Building/Code Enforcement Officer (Chief Enforcement Officer) of any proposed
amendment to such approved site plan.
2. Minor changes may be approved by the Chief Enforcement Officer upon certification in
writing to the Planning Commission that the proposed revision does not alter the basic
design, compliance with the standards of Article 19, nor any specified conditions of the
plan as agreed upon by the Planning Commission. In considering such a determination,
the Chief Enforcement Officer shall consider the following to be a minor change:
a. For residential buildings, the size of structures may be reduced, provided that the
overall density of units does not increase.
b. Square footage of non-residential buildings may be decreased.
c. Change of building height may be altered by up to five percent (5%), but in no case
exceed height limitations.

City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 19 - 18 Article 19
1) Changes required or requested by the City Police or Fire Departments for
safety reasons which do not affect site layout shall be considered a minor
change.
3. Should the Chief Enforcement Officer determine that the requested modification to the
approved Final Site Plan is not minor, the Planning Commission shall be notified in writing
that the site plan has been suspended, and, if construction has initiated, a stop work order
shall be issued for the section of the project deemed not to be in compliance. Thereafter,
the applicant may revise the site plan; and submit the Chief Enforcement Officer for
resubmission to the Planning Commission or minor site plan review in accordance with
Section 19.04.2.
4. Should the Planning Commission determine that the modifications to the Final Site Plan
significantly alter the intent of the Site Plan, a new submittal shall be required.

SECTION 20.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) is provided as a design and planning option, intended to
permit flexibility in the regulation of land development; to encourage innovation in land use, form
of ownership (such as site condominiums) and variety in design, layout, and type of structures
constructed; to preserve significant natural, historical, and architectural features and open space;
to promote efficient provision of public services and utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts;
to provide adequate housing and employment; to encourage development of convenient
recreational facilities; and to encourage the use and improvement of existing sites or existing
buildings when the uniform regulations contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide
adequate protection and safeguards for the site or its surrounding areas or flexibility to consider
adaptive re-use of existing structures.
SECTION 20.02 PUD REGULATIONS
1. A PUD may be applied for in any zoning district. The grant of a planned unit development
application shall require a rezoning by way of amendment of this Ordinance upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval of the City Council.
2. Any land use or mix of land uses authorized in this Ordinance may be included in a planned
unit development, subject to adequate public health, safety, and welfare protection
mechanisms being designed into the development to ensure the compatibility of varied land
uses both within and outside the development.
SECTION 20.03 RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL PUD STANDARDS
1. Residential uses shall be permitted with the following general density standards, based
upon the zoning district in which the property is situated immediately prior to classification
under this Article. Land area under water, public, road rights-of-way and private road
easements shall not be included in the gross density calculation.
Density Permitted
District (Dwelling Units/Gross Acres)
R-1A First Density Residential 1 Dwelling Unit Per 12,000 sq. ft.
R-1B First Density Residential 1 Dwelling Unit Per 7,200 sq. ft.
R-2 Second Density Residential (refer to Section 15.02)
R-3 Third Density Residential (refer to Section 15.02)
R-4 Fourth Density Residential (refer to Section 15.02)
Article 20 Planned Unit Development
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 20 - 2 Article 20
2. Additional density greater than specified above may be allowed at the discretion of the
Planning Commission and City Council based upon a demonstration by the applicant of
design excellence and conformance to the standards for PUD Eligibility listed in Section
20.05 as well as conformance to the City of Northville Master Plan.
3. The Planning Commission and City Council may allow a residential PUD in areas having
a non-residential base zoning subject to compliance with the City Master Plan or a
determination by the Planning Commission and City Council that the proposed
development meets the general intent for PUD Eligibility, as described in Section 20.05.
4. A Planned Unit Development incorporating non-residential uses such as commercial,
industrial, institutional or a mix of non-residential and residential uses shall also be allowed
subject to the design standards of this Article.
SECTION 20.04 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS
1. All regulations within the City Zoning Ordinance applicable to setback, parking and
loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in relation to each
respective land use in the development based upon the zoning districts in which the use is
listed as a Principal Uses Permitted. In all cases, the strictest provisions shall apply.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, deviations with respect to such
regulation may be granted as part of the overall approval of the planned unit development,

of a planned unit development, to the extent authorized by law, for the purpose of ensuring
that existing public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will
be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use
or activity, protecting the natural environment and conserving natural resources and
energy, ensuring compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and promoting the use of land
in a socially and economically desirable manner.
2. Permit conditions may be drafted in writing specifying conditions of approval and use.
Conditions may stipulate that the PUD may only be used for selective land uses provided
the restraint(s): advance, rather than injure, the interests of adjacent landowners; are a
means of harmonizing private interests in land thus benefiting the public interest; are for
the purposes of ensuring that the PUD fulfills the purposes and intent of this section and
thus benefit the public interest; and/or possess a reasonable relationship to the promotion
of the public health, safety, and welfare. A change of land use during operation of the PUD
will render the PUD null and void or will require application for a revised PUD.
3. Conditions imposed shall be designed to protect natural resources and the public health,
safety, and welfare of individuals in the project and those immediately adjacent, and the
community as a whole; are reasonably related to the purposes affected by the planned unit
development; and, necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and be
related to the objective of ensuring compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. All
conditions imposed shall be made a part of the written record of the approved planned unit
development which shall include a site plan and written PUD permit conditions signed by
the City and the applicant.
4. In the event that Conditions set forth herein are not complied with, then the Building
Official shall have the right to compel a Show Cause Hearing by the Planning Commission,
or issue a violation pursuant to Article 33 of this Ordinance. At the Show Cause Hearing,
additional conditions may be imposed by the Planning Commission, or the City may
require submittal of a new PUD application.

the necessary components to ensure protection of natural resources and the health, safety,
and welfare of the users of the planned unit development and the residents of the
surrounding area. In addition, in developments which include residential and nonresidential

SIGNS
SECTION 21.01 SIGN REGULATIONS
a. Intent.
The intent of this Ordinance is to regulate the location, size, construction, and
manner of display of signs and outdoor advertising in order to minimize their
harmful effects on the public health, safety and welfare. While this Ordinance
recognizes that signs and outdoor advertising are necessary to promote commerce
and public information, failure to regulate them may lead to poor identification of
individual businesses, deterioration and blight of the business and residential areas
of the City, conflicts between different types of land use, and reduction in traffic
safety to pedestrians and motorists.
To achieve its intended purpose, this Ordinance has the following objectives:
1) To prevent the placement of signs in a manner that will conceal or obscure
other signs or adjacent businesses;
2) To keep the number of signs and sign messages at the level reasonably
necessary to identify a business and its product or services;
3) To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the buildings they
identify;
4) To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to motorists traveling along,
entering or leaving streets;
5) To promote a quality manner of display which enhances the character of the
City;
6) To prevent the proliferation of temporary signs which might promote visual
blight.

NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
SECTION 22.01 NONCONFORMING LOTS, NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND,
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, AND NONCONFORMING USES OF
STRUCTURES AND PREMISES
1. Intent: It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or
uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. It is recognized
that there exists within the districts established by this Ordinance and subsequent
amendments, lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this
Ordinance was passed or amended, which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted,
under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. Such uses are declared by this
Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted Uses in the districts involved. It is further the
intent of this Ordinance that any expansion, extension or enlargement of a nonconforming
use or structure can only be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the
authority granted to said Board as set forth under Article 25, of this Ordinance.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and
upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on, actual construction
is hereby defined to include the piecing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently
carried on until completion of the building involved.
2. Nonconforming Lots: In any district permitted or special uses may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment or this Ordinance. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width,
or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement variances may be
obtained through approval of the Board of Appeals. A variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall not be required for a non-conforming lot or lot of record if a proposed
structure complies with the Schedule of Regulations (Section 15.01) for all requirements
other than area, or width or both (Please refer to diagrams A & B). (Rev. 11/07)
Article 22 Non-Conforming Uses, Structures and Lots

single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, and
in all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established
by this Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or occupied which
does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any
division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with a width or area below

improvements and increased compliance with the intent of the Zoning
Ordinance requirements.
b. Required Reviews. This Section provides for the conditions under which reoccupancy,
improvement and modification to nonconforming sites may occur. It
does not replace other reviews and requirements contained elsewhere in this
Ordinance. Therefore, where improvements and modifications are proposed to
nonconforming sites, they shall be subject to Site Plan Review according to Article
19.

SECTION 25.04 POWERS AND DUTIES
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning district
classification on any property, nor to make any change in the terms of this Ordinance, but does
have power to act on those matters where this Ordinance provides for an administrative review,
interpretation, or exception and to authorize a variance as defined in this Section and laws of the
State of Michigan; said powers include:
a. Appeal of Administrative Decisions: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
by the applicant that there is an error in any order requirement, permit, decision or
refusal made by the Chief Enforcement Officer or any other administrative official
or the Board itself carrying out or enforcing any provision of this Ordinance. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall not however have authority to review a denial of a
special use permit considered in accordance with Section 16.01 or a condition of
special use imposed by the Planning Commission. Appeal of special use and
planned unit development decisions shall be via Circuit Court. (Rev. 12/06)
b. Nonuse (Dimensional) Variances: To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance from
any dimensional standard or requirement of this chapter, such as, but not limited to,
density, height, bulk, setback, or parking and landscaping requirements whereby
reason of unique physical characteristics a specific piece of property at the time of
enactment of this Ordinance or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of
such property, the strict application of such regulations if enacted would result in
practical difficulties upon the owner of such property, provided such relief may be
granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially
impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
Article 25 Board of Zoning Appeals
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 25 - 4 Article 25
In granting a nonuse variance, the Board may attach conditions regarding the
location, character, and other features of the proposed uses, as it may deem
reasonable, in furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. In granting a nonuse
variance, the Board shall state the grounds upon which it justified the granting of a
variance. The board shall not grant a nonuse variance unless it shall have made a
finding of fact based upon the evidence, as presented to it in each specific case.
Nonuse variances shall be granted if the facts meet all the criteria specified below:
(Rev. 8/15)
1. Practical difficulties. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances
or conditions applying to the property that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same Zoning District or in the general vicinity. Because
of these circumstances or conditions, compliance with the strict letter of the
restrictions would create practical difficulties, unreasonably preventing the
use of the property for a permitted purpose or rendering conformity with
such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. The showing of mere
inconvenience is insufficient to justify a variance. Practical difficulties
include one or more of the following: (Rev. 8/15)
i. The exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific
property;
ii. The exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or
manmade constraints or other extraordinary situation on the land,
building or structure; and
iii. The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the
property in question; whereby the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this chapter would involve practical difficulties.
2. Substantial justice. Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do
substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the
district; or, as an alternative, granting of lesser variance than requested
would give substantial relief to the owner of the property involved and be
more consistent with justice to other property owners.
3. Not self-created. The problem and resulting need for the variance did not
result from the actions of the applicant and/or the applicants predecessor.
This criterion may or may not be considered depending upon whether the
practical difficulty would have existed regardless of the action. Examples
of actions that are self-created (and therefore do not meet this criterion)
include, but are not limited to the following: (Rev. 8/15)
i. Claiming practical difficulty for a substandard lot when the
owner has sold off portions that would have prevented the
practical difficulty
Article 25 Board of Zoning Appeals
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 25 - 5 Article 25
ii. Building during the pendency of an appeal
iii. Ignorance of the ordinance
4. Minimum variance necessary. The variance requested is the minimum
necessary to permit reasonable use of the land. (Rev. 12/06)
5. The Board of Zoning Appeals may evaluate whether or not the request
would have an impact on public safety or create a public nuisance. (Rev.
8/15)
c. Use Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a use variance only upon
a finding that an unnecessary hardship exists. A use variance is a variance that
permits a use that is otherwise not provided for in a zoning district. Approval of a
use variance shall require an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) or five (5)
members of the Board of Zoning Appeals. A finding of an unnecessary hardship
shall require demonstration by the applicant of all of the following:
1. Unreasonable current zoning designation. The applicant has demonstrated
that the site cannot reasonably be used for any of the uses allowed within
the current zoning district designation. The Board may require submission
of documentation from real estate or market experts, or a certified appraiser,
to substantiate this finding.
2. Unique circumstances. The need for the variance is due to unique
circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the
area or to other properties in the same zoning district. The applicant must
prove that there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not
generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it
impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment. In those
situations where the difficulty is shared by others, the Board may find that
relief should be accomplished by an amendment to the zoning ordinance,
not a variance.
3. Not self-created. The problem and resulting need for the variance has not
been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicants immediate
predecessor.
4. Capacity of roads, infrastructure, and public services. The capacity and
operations of public streets, utilities, other facilities and services will not be
significantly compromised.
5. Character of neighborhood. The use variance will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood nor be of detriment to adjacent properties.
6. Minimum variance necessary. The variance requested is the minimum
necessary to permit reasonable use of the land. (Rev. 12/06)
Article 25 Board of Zoning Appeals
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 25 - 6 Article 25
d. Ordinance and Map Interpretations. The Board of Zoning Appeals may hear and
decide in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, requests for
interpretations of the Zoning Ordinance and Map, as the Board may require to
preserve and promote the character of the zoning provision or district in question
and otherwise promote the purposes of this Ordinance and those of the Citys
Master Plan. (Rev. 12/06)
e. Temporary Buildings and Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have authority
to:
1. Permit temporary residences, as defined, for a specified or time limited
period. An emergency temporary residence may be approved by the
Building Official, as described in Section 18.22. (Rev. 8/18)
2. Permit temporary uses and structures used during construction, such as
temporary asphalt or concrete plants. This provision does not apply to a
temporary construction building, trailer, office, or sales office, as described
in Section 18.22, which may be approved by the Building Official. (Rev.
8/18)
3. Permit temporary outdoor sales, outdoor display, seasonal sales (such as
Christmas trees) on private property owned or leased by the entity
conducting the sale located in the Local Commercial District (LCD),
Central Business District (CBD) or the General Commercial District
(GCD). This shall exclude outdoor sales permitted by the Planning
Commission as a special use in accordance with Section 11.03 (GCD) and
seasonal sales conducted by non-profit entities in accordance with Section
18.22. (Rev. 8/18)
4. Permit other uses or buildings not mentioned above or listed in Section
18.22 for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months with the granting of an
additional twelve (12) months for uses which do not require the erection of
any capital improvement of a structured nature. (Rev. 8/18)
(a) The granting of the temporary use or building shall in no way
constitute a change in the basic uses permitted in the district nor on
the property wherein the temporary use is permitted. (Rev. 4/10)
(b) The granting of the temporary use shall be granted in writing,
stipulating all conditions as to time, nature of development
permitted and arrangements for removing the use at the termination
of said temporary permit.
(c) All setbacks, land coverage, off-street parking, lighting and other
requirements to be considered in protecting the public health, safety,
peace, morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the City of Northville shall be made at the discretion
of the Board of Zoning Appeals and as herein provided.
Article 25 Board of Zoning Appeals
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 25 - 7 Article 25
(d) In classifying uses as not requiring capital improvement, the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall determine that they are either demountable

developments such as, but not limited to, golf-driving ranges and
outdoor archery courts; or structures which do not require

and shall not alter the natural character of the environment by
destroying its ecological systems.
(f) No temporary use permit shall be granted without first giving notice
to owners of adjacent property of the time and place of a public
hearing to be held as further provided for in this Ordinance.
f. Nonconforming Uses and Structures. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have
authority to permit, upon proper application and adequate showing by applicant, an
expansion, extension or enlargement of a nonconforming use or structure, subject
to the following conditions and limitations. (Rev. 12/06)
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, extended, or
moved except as permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to
authority granted to said Board as set forth in Article 25, Section 25.04 of
this Ordinance.
2. Exterior alterations, expansions or structural modification involving
exterior load-bearing walls shall be subject to review by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, in accordance with Article 25, Section 25.04. This shall
not include normal repair or routine maintenance of exterior surfaces.
g. Other Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall also hear and decide on all
other matters referred to it or upon which is required to pass under this Ordinance.
(Rev. 12/06)
In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to the Ordinance, the Board shall, before
making any variations from the Ordinance in a specific case, first determine that the proposed
variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or unreasonably
increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public
safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area,
or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the
inhabitants of the City of Northville. The Board may send the proposal to Planning Commission
for site plan review to determine the appropriateness of the proposed variances in regards to the
use or development of the property.
In granting or denying a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards to carry out the requirements of the article, including conditions
regarding the location, character, site design, height, parking and loading facilities, additional

the applicant in any matter upon which it is authorized by this Ordinance to render a decision
provided however, that the concurring vote of five (5) members of the board shall be necessary to
grant a variance from uses of land permitted in this ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall be
construed to give or grant to the Board the power or authority to alter or change this Ordinance or
the Zoning Map, such power and authority being reserved to the Mayor and the City Council of
the City of Northville in the manner provided by law. (Rev. 3/13)

term occupant may be used in making notification under this subsection. (Rev. 12/06)
The notice shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the date the application will
be considered at a public hearing. The notice shall do all of the following:
a. Describe the nature of the application.
b. Indicate the property that is the subject of the application. The notice shall include
a listing of all existing street addresses within the property. Street addresses do not
need to be created and listed if no such addresses currently exist within the property.
If there are no street addresses, other means of identification may be used.
c. State when and where the application will be considered.
d. Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning the
application. (Rev. 12/06)
Petitions for zoning ordinance amendments or conditional zoning amendments shall be submitted

next regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting. At the next regularly scheduled meeting,
the Planning Commission shall set a date for a public hearing to receive public comment. The
standard forms shall be completed in the manner prescribed and such documents, as required by
the ordinance, shall be filed with the Building Department. A fee schedule, as provided by

administering the application process and for advertising public hearings and other incidental costs
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 2 Article 29
relative to said petition. The Building Department shall transmit the application to the Planning
Commission. (Rev. 2/12)
In reviewing any petition for a zoning map amendment, the Planning Commission shall evaluate
all factors relevant to the petition and shall make its recommendations for disposition of the
petition to the City Council following a public hearing.
The factors to be considered by the Planning Commission may include, but shall not be limited to,
the following:
a. Whether the rezoning is consistent with the policies and uses proposed for that area
in the Citys Master Land Use Plan. If conditions have changed since the Master
Plan was adopted, the consistency with recent development trends in the area as
well as other factors or conditions which may have changed.
b. Whether all of the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning would be compatible
with other zones and uses in the surrounding area.
c. Whether any public services, facilities, traffic flow, or natural features would be
significantly and adversely impacted by a development or use allowed under the
requested rezoning.
d. Whether the uses allowed under the proposed rezoning would be equally or better
suited to the area than uses allowed under the current zoning of the land.
e. Whether the condition and/or value of property in the City or in adjacent
communities would be significantly and adversely impacted by a development or
use allowed under the requested rezoning.
f. Whether or not the requested zoning change is justified by a change in conditions
since the original ordinance was adopted or by an error in the original ordinance.
g. Whether precedents might result from approval or denial of the petition, and the
possible effects of such precedents. (Rev. 2/12)
SECTION 29.02 CONDITIONAL REZONING (New 2/12)
a. Intent. It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the best
interests of the City, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking a change
in zoning classification, that certain conditions could be proposed by property
owners as part of a request for rezoning. This is especially true since the City must
consider all potential uses which may be made of property when considering a
traditional rezoning request, some of which may be inappropriate for a particular
piece of property considering items such as, but not limited to, the surrounding land
uses, the City Master Plan, available infrastructure and utilities, and natural
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 3 Article 29
features. It is the intent of this Section to provide a process consistent with the
provisions of Section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act No.
110 of 2006 as amended, MCL 125.3101 et seq., by which an owner seeking a
rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or development
of land as part of the rezoning request.
b. Application and Offer of Conditions. An owner of land may voluntarily offer in
writing conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a
conditional rezoning is requested. This offer may be made either at the time the
application for conditional rezoning is filed, or additional conditions may be offered
at a later time during the conditional rezoning process as set forth below.
1) General Procedure. A request for a conditional rezoning shall be
commenced by filing an application with the Building Department, on the
required forms, accompanied by the specified fees. The application and
process for considering a conditional rezoning request will be the same as
that for considering a rezoning request without any conditions, except as
modified by this Section. The application shall explicitly describe the
proposed conditional rezoning and shall be signed by the owner of the
property. Applications for conditional rezoning of a specific site shall be
accompanied by a plot plan or survey, as well as a conceptual plan showing
the specific proposed use of the property. The concept plan shall contain
the following details:
- A scaled map or drawing of the property
- Existing and proposed uses, buildings, and structures
- Parking arrangements and on-site circulation
- Relationship of the site to adjoining parcels
- Proposed landscape screens, walls, or buffers
Detailed information regarding topography, site engineering, building
architecture, or other items not relevant to the zoning decision may be
waived by the Planning Commission.
2) Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing a formal request for a
conditional rezoning, and prior to a public hearing, the applicant is
encouraged to meet with the City Planning Consultant, and other
representatives as deemed necessary by the City, to discuss the proposed
development. The pre-application conference is intended to be informative
and advisory in nature, and affords the applicant the opportunity to discuss
the land use and planning policies of the City of Northville.
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 4 Article 29
The applicant must present a conceptual plan for the contemplated
conditional rezoning at or before the pre-application conference. Any and
all statements made by the representatives of the City at the pre-application
conference have no legal force and are not legal and binding promises,
commitments, or contracts.
c. Review Procedures. The owners offer of conditions may not purport to authorize
uses or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district. The
owners offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the
property for which the conditional rezoning is requested.
1) Other Required Approvals by the City of Northville.
a. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require a special land use permit under the terms of this
Ordinance may only be commenced if a special land use permit for
such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
b. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require a variance under the terms of this Ordinance may
only be commenced if a variance for such use or development is
ultimately granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance.
c. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions
that would require site plan approval under the terms of this
Ordinance may only be commenced if site plan approval for such
use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the
terms of this Ordinance.
2) Amendment of Conditions. The offer of conditions may be amended during
the process of conditional rezoning consideration, provided that any
amended or additional conditions (other than minor or technical
adjustments) are entered voluntarily by the owner, and confirmed in writing.
An owner may withdraw in writing all or part of its offer of conditions any
time prior to final rezoning action of the City Council provided that, if such
withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commissions public hearing
on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be
referred back to the Planning Commission for a new public hearing with
appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
d. Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission, after public hearing
and consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in Section 29.01 of this
Ordinance, may recommend approval, approval with recommended changes, or
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 5 Article 29
denial of the rezoning; provided, however, that any recommended changes to the
offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner in writing.
e. City Council Review. After receipt of the Planning Commissions
recommendation, the City Council shall review the Planning Commissions
recommendation and deliberate upon the requested conditional rezoning, and may
approve or deny the conditional rezoning request. If the applicant initiates
additional or different conditions not considered by the Planning Commission
subsequent to the recommendation of the Planning Commission, then the City
Council shall refer such proposed additional or different conditions to the Planning
Commission for report thereon within a time specified by the City Council, and the
City Council shall thereafter proceed to deny or approve the conditional rezoning.
f. Approval. If the City Council finds the conditional rezoning request and offer of
conditions acceptable, the offer of conditions shall be incorporated into a formal
written Statement of Conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming in form
to the provisions of this Section. The Statement of Conditions shall be incorporated
by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the Ordinance adopted by the
City Council to accomplish the requested conditional rezoning. The Statement of
Conditions shall:
1) Be prepared in a form recordable with the County Register of Deeds;
2) Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains;
3) Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of Conditions runs
with the land, and is binding upon successor owners of the land;
4) Incorporate by attachment the conceptual plan which formed the basis of
the conditional rezoning;
5) Contain the notarized signatures of all the owners of the property proceeded
by a statement attesting to the fact that they are the only parties having an
interest in the property, and that they voluntarily offer and consent to the
provisions contained within the Statement of Conditions;
6) The Statement of Conditions may be reviewed and approved by the City
Attorney, with the applicant to pay all costs associated with such review and
approval.
The approved Statement of Conditions shall be filed by the owner with the County Register of
Deeds within thirty (30) days after approval of the conditional rezoning. The owner shall provide
the City with a recorded copy of the Statement of Conditions within thirty (30) days of receipt.
The City Council shall have the authority to waive this requirement if it determines that, given the
nature of the conditions and/or the time frame within which the conditions are to be satisfied, the
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 6 Article 29
recording of the Statement of Conditions would be of no material benefit to the City or to any
subsequent owner of the land; and
Upon the conditional rezoning taking effect, the Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect the new
zoning classification, together with a designation that the land was a Conditional Rezoning with a
Statement of Conditions. Upon the conditional rezoning taking effect, and after the required
recording of the Statement of Conditions, unless waived, use of the land so rezoned shall conform
thereafter to all the requirements regulating use and development within the new zoning district as
modified by any more restrictive provisions contained in the Statement of Conditions.
g. Compliance with Conditions. Any person who establishes development or
commences a use upon land that has been conditionally rezoned shall continuously
operate and maintain the development or use in full compliance with all the
conditions set forth in the Statement of Conditions. Any failure to comply fully
with the conditions contained within the Statement of Conditions shall constitute a
violation of this Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such
violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as
provided by law.
h. Time Period for Establishing Development or Use. The approved development
and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required permits must be
commenced upon the land within eighteen (18) months after the effective date by
publication of the conditional rezoning action, and must thereafter proceed
diligently to completion. This time limitation may, upon written request, be
extended by the City Council if:
1) It is demonstrated that there is a strong likelihood that the development
and/or use will commence within the period of extension and proceed
diligently thereafter to completion, and
2) The City Council finds that there has not been change in circumstances that
would render the conditional rezoning with Statement of Conditions
incompatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise
inconsistent with sound zoning policy.
i. Reversion of Zoning. If the approved development and/or use of the rezoned land
does not occur within the time frame specified under subsection (h) above, then the
land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in MCL 125.3405(2).
The reversion process shall be initiated by the City Council, and proceed pursuant
to Section 29.01. Reversion to a different zoning classification may also be
considered by the City.
j. Subsequent Rezoning of Land. When land that is conditionally rezoned with the
Statement of Conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning classification, or
to the same zoning classification but with a different or no Statement of Conditions,
whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to subsection (i) above, or
Article 29 Amending this Ordinance
City of Northville Zoning Ordinance May, 2019 29 - 7 Article 29
upon application of the landowner, or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions
imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon
the owners written request, the City Clerk shall record with the County Register
of Deeds a notice that the Statement of Conditions is no longer in effect.
k. Amendment of Conditions. During the time period for commencement of an
approved development or use specified pursuant to subsection (h) above, or during
any extension thereof granted by the City Council, the City shall not add to or alter
the conditions in the Statement of Conditions. The Statement of Conditions may
be amended thereafter in the same manner as was prescribed for the original
conditional rezoning and Statement of Conditions.
l. City Right to Rezone. Nothing in the Statement of Conditions nor in the provisions
of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the City from rezoning all or any portion
of land that is subject to a Statement of Conditions to another zoning classification.
Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this Ordinance and the
Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act No. 110 of 2006 as amended, MCL
125.3101 et seq.
m. Failure to Offer Conditions. The City shall not require an owner to offer conditions
as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect an
owners rights under this Ordinance.
