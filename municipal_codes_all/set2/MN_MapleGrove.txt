PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Maple Grove, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through January 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Stevie Koll Anderson, Deputy City Clerk, Mr. George Hoff, City Attorney and other members of the city's staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," or "this section," as the case may be, or to "sections _____ through _____." The inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 1-13. - General penalty. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or city ordinance shall be punished as a misdemeanor; Provided, however, the the city's prosecuting attorney shall have the discretion to charge any violation of this Code as a petty misdemeanor. The term "misdemeanor" shall be as defined in Minn. Stats. § 609.02, subd. 3. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In case of the amendment by the city council of any section of this Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to the section, as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a specified penalty other than the general penalty in subsection (a) of this section is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so specified shall be held to relate to the amended section, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.

ARTICLE II. - REGULATIONS REGARDING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 

Sec. 4-40. - Social host. 
(a)  Purpose and findings . The Maple Grove City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Maple Grove City Council finds that: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.

(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(5)  Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption.

ARTICLE VIII. - PAWNBROKERS 

Sec. 10-221. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because pawn businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property stolen by others easily and quickly. The city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The purpose of this article is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  Further, this article will help the police department regulate pawn businesses, establish costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and identify criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information. Finally, this article implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS) operated by the City of Minneapolis Police Department.

    Billable transaction. Every reportable transaction conducted by a pawnbroker except renewals, redemptions or extensions of existing pawns on items previously reported and continuously in the licensee's possession is a billable transaction. 
    Pawnbroker means any natural person, partnership or corporation, either as principal, or agent or employee thereof, that loans money on deposit or pledge of personal property or other valuable thing on condition of selling the property or other thing back again at a stipulated price, or that loans money secured by chattel mortgage on personal property, taking possession of the property or any part thereof so mortgaged. To the extent that a pawnbroker's business includes buying personal property previously used, rented or leased, or selling it on consignment, the provisions of this article shall be applicable. 
    Reportable transaction. Every transaction conducted by a pawnbroker in which merchandise is received through a pawn, purchase, consignment or trade, or in which a pawn is renewed, extended or redeemed, is reportable except: 
(1)  The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used merchandise from a merchant, manufacturer or wholesaler having an established permanent place of business, and the retail sale of such merchandise, provided the pawnbroker must maintain a record of such purchase or consignment which described each item, and must mark each item in a manner which relates it to that transaction record.

Upon seizure of the property constituting the nuisance, the city will inventory the property, and the city administrator or the city administrator's designee will determine whether the items seized have any reasonable value, in excess of city costs to store and dispose of the property. If, after inventory, the city administrator or his/her designee makes a determination that no reasonable value of the property exists or that destruction of the property is necessary to abate the nuisance, the property shall be destroyed. If the city administrator or his/her designee, however, determines such destruction is not necessary and there is reasonable value remaining in the property, the property shall be sold. The amount of money received as a result of any sale, if any, shall be applied against the cost of abatement, including all costs incurred by the city in the abatement, including without limitation the cost of the removal, storage, handling, destruction and disposal thereof, all staff time, legal and other consulting fees.

Sec. 14-251. - Purpose. 
(a)  Commercial mining, stripping, excavating and extracting activities are now being and for some time have been conducted in certain places within the corporate limits of the city, in order to remove from the ground black dirt, sand, gravel and other minerals or substances existing on, in or under such place. 
(b)  The city finds that the extraction of minerals by surface mining is a basic and essential activity making an important contribution to the economic well-being of the city. The economical availability of sand, gravel, rock, soil and other materials is vital to the continued growth of the region and the city. The city further finds that it is not practicable to extract minerals required by society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste materials. The danger exists that noncompatible land uses could unnecessarily deny the benefit of these materials to society in the future. It is further found that the character of mining may create undesirable land and water conditions which can be detrimental to the health, safety and welfare and property rights of the citizens of the city. However, if properly regulated and if rehabilitation of surface mined lands is required, mining can take place within the city in such a manner that undesirable side effects of the operation may be restricted to an acceptable level. 
(c)  The purposes of this article are to provide for the economical availability of sand, gravel, rock, soil and other materials vital to the continued growth of the region and the city, to establish reasonable and uniform limitations, safeguards and controls in the city for the future production of such minerals, and to control and minimize pollution caused by erosion or sedimentation, all in furtherance of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(Code 1984, § 440:00) 
Sec. 14-252. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Active gravel pit and active excavation mean: 
(1)  The terms "active gravel pit" and "active excavation" mean any artificial excavation of the earth dug, excavated or made by the removal of the natural surface of the earth, whether sod, soil, sand, gravel, stone, or other matter, creating a depression or depressions exceeding in any one place 1,000 square feet of surface area, the bottom or lowest point of which shall be one foot or more below or lower than the level of the adjoining unexcavated land, in which depression, pit or excavation water may fall, gather, collect or remain stagnant, putrid or polluted, or which depression may be or become dangerous from the standpoint of public safety or health, or to children playing therein or thereby, or which depression may become a public nuisance or deteriorate the value of the adjacent property. 
(2)  The terms "active gravel pit" and "active excavation" also mean any area where the topsoil or overburden has been removed for the purpose of mining earthly deposits or minerals, yet the area has remained idle since the topsoil removal. 
(3)  The terms "active gravel pit" and "active excavation" also mean any area that is being used for stockpiling, storage, or processing or recycling of sand, gravel, soils, or other materials or products derived from gravel mining, even if such materials did not originate or were not produced on the premises. Such operations may include, but are not limited to, concrete mixing, concrete block production, asphalt production (also governed by chapter 10, article III), the grinding and/or crushing of concrete or asphalt, and the processing of petroleum-contaminated soil being managed pursuant to state pollution control agency approval, so long as the processing or recycling does not violate any federal or state law or any of the requirements of any of the agencies referred to in section 14-260(7). 
(4)  Depressions, pits, and excavations made for the purpose of a foundation, cellar, or basement of some immediately pending structure to be created, built or placed thereon contemporaneously with or immediately following such excavating and covering, or to cover such excavated pit or depression when completed, are excluded from the definition of an active gravel pit or active excavation if a building permit has been issued. 
    Impounded waters means any and all liquid substances kept on public or private property in such a manner that more than 500 gallons are above the natural surface of the surrounding ground. 
    Inactive gravel pit and inactive excavation mean all that area for which a conditional use permit or annual license has been obtained for gravel pit or excavation purposes from the city and has not had the topsoil or overburden removed. No actual excavations or mining may take place and no stockpiling, storage, or processing of materials is allowed in an inactive gravel pit or inactive excavation area. The land has the potential to be changed to an active classification at any future date during the annual permit renewal process. 
    License fee means a fee charged annually for a permit as required in this article. The terms "license" and "permit" may be used interchangeably in this article. 
    Minerals and earthly deposits mean soil, clay, stone, sand and gravel and any other similar solid material or substance to be excavated from natural deposits. 
    Operator means any person, including every public or governmental agency, engaged in active or inactive excavation or the processing of sand, gravel, rock, other soils or derived products. 
    Overburden means the earth, rock and other materials that lie above a natural deposit of mineral. 
    Reclamation, restoration and rehabilitation mean to renew land to a self-sustaining longterm use which is compatible with contiguous land uses and compatible with the city's comprehensive land use plan. Reclamation, restoration or rehabilitation is to be in accordance with the standards set forth in this article, including the re-establishment of vegetative cover and soil stability and the establishment of safe conditions appropriate to the intended use of the land. 
    Restoration area means all land areas wherein conditional use permits or excavation permits have been granted by the city in the past and for which permits are no longer requested or issued. Once a land area is classified as a restoration area, it cannot be reclassified or converted back to an active area unless a new conditional use permit is obtained.

(c)  One-time surcharge. 
(1)  In addition to the annual permit fee set forth in section 16-81, each applicant who is to be issued a permit pursuant to this article after July 15, 1987, shall pay, prior to issuance of the permit, a one-time license surcharge in an amount set forth in section 16-81. The surcharge is intended to reimburse the city for the cost of preparing the city's gravel mining area plan which was done pursuant to the city's police power function of regulating the commercial mining, stripping, excavating and extracting activities occurring therein and which was also prepared to further the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(2)  Immediate payment may, at the city's discretion, be substituted with a written agreement between the applicant and the city, secured by a surety satisfactory to the city whereby payment of the surcharge could be made in annual installments extending over a period of up to five years and which installments would be collected together with interest due on March 1 of each year. To be accepted as a substitute for immediate payment of the surcharge, any such agreement must be executed prior to issuance of the permit. 
(3)  Interest shall accrue on the surcharge at the rate of 81/2 percent per annum. Interest not paid in advance shall be compounded annually. 
(4)  If one or more of the annual surcharge installments to be made pursuant to such a written agreement is not paid by an applicant, the city may collect the surcharge by drawing upon the applicant's surety. 
(d)  Refunds or prorating. Once the permit is granted to the applicant by the council, the termination of activities at the pit or excavation or revocation of the permit shall not entitle the applicant to the refund or prorating of any of the license fee that has been paid for that current year. 
(e)  Furnishing of maps. If the application is for a renewal of an existing permit, the applicant need not furnish the maps specified in section 14-254(4) and (5) unless major modifications or changes are to be made in the approved restoration plan of the land when gravel removal operations are completed.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 16-321. - Schedule of rates and charges. 
(a)  Applicability. The occupant of any premises connected with the municipal sewage system shall pay as basic rental charges for the use of the sewage system the amounts as set forth in the fee schedule. 
(b)  Sewer usage charge. All real property having a structure located thereon which structure is connected to the municipal sewer system shall pay to the city a sewer base usage charge as set forth in the fee schedule. 
(1)  Residential equivalent units shall be determined by the city at least annually. In making such determination for multifamily residential structures, the city shall consider front footage of the lot, number of water connections and other relevant factors. 
(2)  The flow charge shall be based on the winter quarter water consumption. 
(3)  Residential units connected to the municipal sewer system, but not to the municipal water system, shall pay the base rate plus a flow charge equal to the average flow of single-family detached residential units within the city. Such average shall be determined by the city at least annually. 
(c)  Sanitary sewer industrial user strength charge. 
(1)  Findings. The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state (referred to in this section as "the commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations thereunder (referred to in this section as "the Act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the metropolitan disposal system (as defined in Minn. Stats. § 473.121, subd. 24) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial wastes, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. Furthermore, Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served. 
(2)  Establishment of charges. For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the commission that are based upon the strength of a discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city (referred to in this section as the "strength charge"). 
(3)  Adoption of strength charge formula. For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established by subsection (c)(2) of this section, there is hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance with the Act the same strength charge formula designated in Resolution No. 76-172, as amended, adopted by the governing body of the commission on June 15, 1976, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the commission. 
(4)  Payment. It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength charge established by subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto at the same time such user pays its charges under this section, and such charges shall be subject to all late charges and/or penalty fees charged by the city for sanitary sewer disposal. 
(5)  Lien for unpaid charges. As provided by Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established that if the strength charge established by subsection (c)(2) of this section is not paid by the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, the delinquent sewer strength charge, plus the late charge and/or penalties established pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent may certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the city or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy. 
(d)  Additional charges. Additional sewer charges are set forth in the fee schedule.

DIVISION 2. - METROPOLITAN SEWER SERVICE AVAILABILITY CHARGE 

Sec. 16-341. - Findings. 
    The metropolitan council has determined to reserve unused capacity in the metropolitan disposal system each year commencing in 1973 for local government units in which new buildings to be connected to the system and new connections to the system are commenced during such year, and to allocate the debt service costs of such unused capacity for the year among such local government units. In order for the city to pay such costs allocated to it each year, it will be necessary to establish sewer service availability and connection charges for all buildings to be constructed or connected to the metropolitan disposal system on or after January 1, 1973. 
(Code 1984, § 540:00; Ord. No. 13-24, § 1, 12-16-2013)

(a)  For the purpose of paying costs of reserve capacity allocated to the city each year by the metropolitan council, there is hereby continued as heretofore established a charge for: 
(1)  The availability of treatment works and interceptors composing the metropolitan disposal system; and 
(2)  Connections, direct and indirect, to the metropolitan disposal system. 
(b)  The charge is imposed on each building or structure in the city, and each connection to the metropolitan disposal system directly or through the city's system, inside any sewer service area established by the metropolitan council, construction for which is commenced on or after January 1, 1973. The charge shall be payable upon the issuance of a building permit or connection permit, as the case may be, but no charge shall be due upon the issuance of a connection permit if a charge was paid upon issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  The charge for each building or structure shall be equal to the number of units of sewage volume which will be discharged, multiplied by an amount established by the metropolitan council. A unit of sewage volume shall be 100,000 gallons per year and shall be assigned as follows: 
(1)  Single-family houses, townhouses, and duplex units, apartments and condominiums with potential for laundry facilities included in each unit, shall each comprise one unit. 
(2)  Condominiums and apartments where there is no plumbing for laundry facilities within each dwelling unit shall each comprise 80 percent of a unit. 
(3)  Mobile homes shall each comprise 80 percent of a unit. 
(4)  Other buildings and structures shall be assigned one unit for each 100,000 gallons of flow or part thereof which it is estimated they will discharge. 
(5)  Public housing units and housing units subsidized under any federal program for low and moderate income housing shall be counted as 75 percent of the unit equivalent for that type of housing. 
(6)  Units existing or for which building permits were issued prior to January 1, 1973, shall be counted as one-half the unit equivalent for that type of housing, if connected to the metropolitan disposal system prior to January 1, 1974, and shall be counted at the full rate thereafter. 
(Code 1984, § 540:05; Ord. No. 13-24, § 1, 12-16-2013) 
Sec. 16-343. - Administration. 
    The clerk or the agent of the clerk shall prepare or revise building permit or sewage connection permit application forms to provide information necessary for the computation of the number of units assignable to the building or structure in question, and shall collect the applicable charge before issuance of a permit. The clerk or agent of the clerk shall make such information available to the metropolitan council upon request. If, upon filing a report covering such permit with the metropolitan council, the council determines that a greater number of units is assignable to the building or structure in question, any additional amount of cost allocated to the city as a result shall be paid by the person to whom the permit was granted.

(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to reduce public exposure to health risks where law enforcement officers have determined that hazardous chemicals or residue from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated dump site may exist. Professional reports, based on assessments, testing and investigations, show that chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces, furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The city council finds that such sites, and the personal property within such sites, may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site or using or being exposed to contaminated personal property. 
(b)  Interpretation and application. In the interpretation and application of this article, the provisions herein shall be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this article are either more or less restrictive to the public than comparable provisions imposed by any other law, ordinance, statute, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements on the public shall prevail. Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare any section or subpart of this article to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the article as a whole or any part thereof, other than the provision declared invalid.

This section shall not apply to: buildings of less than 8,500 square feet; or any building constructed of wood frame; provided none of the aforementioned buildings make use of any metal construction or any below grade levels or parking areas. Any part of any R-3 occupancy building, including below grade levels and parking areas, are exempt from the requirements of this section. For the purposes of this section, parking structures and stairwells are included in the definition of "building" and stair shafts and elevators are included in the definition of "all parts of the building". For purposes of this section, adequate radio coverage shall be an average received field strength of no less than -93 dBm, or one percent BER, measured at 30 to 36 inches above the floor over 90 percent of the area of each floor and other critical areas determined by the fire chief or the fire chief's designee such as fire command centers, stairwells, elevators, high hazard areas, basements, and parking areas. Without an in-building radio system, only the received signal level standard must be achieved as the talk out path is equivalent to the talk in path in this regional radio system. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-217. - Amplification systems allowed. 
    Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio coverage shall be equipped with either a radiating cable system or an internal multiple antenna system with or without FCC type accepted bi-directional 800 MHz amplification as needed. If amplification is used in the system, all required FCC authorizations must be obtained prior to the use of the system. If any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without external power input. The battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power input. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-218. - Testing procedures. 
(a)  Acceptance test procedure. With or without an in-building radio system, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have the regional radio system performance tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90 percent of the total floor area and the critical areas designated. 
(1)  Talk-in from the regional radio system coverage testing. 
a.  The talk-in coverage testing process shall be the same for buildings with and without in-building amplification systems. 
b.  During test measuring, the center of the test equipment receive antenna shall be between 30 and 36 inches above the floor. 
c.  On each floor of a building to be tested, the floor space, except for designated critical areas, shall be divided into square or rectangular areas of approximately the same size and shape. Each floor shall have at least ten grid areas; however, the maximum size of grid areas shall not exceed 2,500 square feet. In buildings with support columns laid out in a grid, the corners of the each grid may be arranged at the columns for ease in identifying grid corners while testing is in progress. In buildings, such as a warehouse, with large open areas, tests shall be conducted near the center of each grid although the exact center may not be easily accessible due to the location of large machinery, storage racks, etc. In buildings with divided office spaces, with or without floor to ceiling patricians, tests shall be conducted in an office at or near the center of a grid. In buildings with a large open area and an attached two-story, split level office or other area, the lower level of the two-story, split level attachment shall be considered as an extension of the large open area. 
d.  In multi-story buildings and parking ramps, testing shall begin at the lowest level, including any subgrade level(s), and continue up one floor at a time. In-building amplification may only be required on the lowest level or levels of a multi-story building or parking ramp. 
e.  Average radio signal field strength shall be measured and recorded in each grid, and in each designated critical area defined above. Average field strength may be obtained through use of an instantaneous measuring instrument and a computer that samples the actual field strength at very short time intervals and averages the sample values. As an alternative, a field strength measuring instrument with an analog or digital readout of average field strength may also be used. Measurements shall be made while the measuring instrument is moved over a distance of four to ten feet. If the average field strength varies over the measurement path, the lowest (most negative) value shall be recorded. The test instrumentation used shall have been calibrated within the six-month period prior to the testing. 
f.  The percentage of area passed shall be calculated as 100 times the result of dividing the number of grids and critical areas that are at least at -93 dBm or one percent BER by the total number of grids and critical areas tested. 
g.  The donor antenna in an in-building amplification system may receive up to 87 800 MHz radio frequencies of approximately equal field strength from the regional system, plus some others of approximately equal field strength from other radio systems. At any time, the donor antenna may be receiving at least 60 radio frequencies of approximately equal level in the pass band ranges. For that reason, it shall be assumed that the output level of talk-in amplifiers will be at + 3.2 dBm per channel maximum. Therefore, grid and critical areas tests shall be conducted while the head end amplifier is disconnected and a signal of + 3.2 dBm is inserted into the connector downstream from the headend amplifier. 
h.  Any in-building talk-in amplification system shall have pass band filters before the input to the first (headend) amplifier that shall pass 806 to 817 MHz and 821-824 MHz only. In the future, within six months after notification by the fire chief or his designee, the pass band filter frequency range shall be changed in accordance with instructions, or an additional pass band filter for 700 MHz band frequencies shall be added. When the donor antenna is installed, the average signal level received on the Hennepin East site control channel shall be measured at the antenna connector. A signal at that average received signal level shall be inserted into the cable to the headend amplifier and filter while the output level of the headend amplifier is measured, and the output level of the amplifier shall be set at + 29 + 1 dBm. 
i.  Alternative in-building amplification systems that do not involve broadband pass band filters will be accepted provided that similar testing can be demonstrated. 
(2)  Talk-out to the regional radio system testing. 
a.  With an in-building amplification system, the talk-out (to the regional 800 MHz radio system) shall be measured at the same grid and critical area locations as the talk-in measurements were made. The measurements shall be made using a three-Watt portable radio with a well-charged battery to transmit into the in-building radio system while field strength is measured out of the connector that is normally attached to the donor antenna. To pass, the field strength at the donor antenna shall be the measured value at the connector plus the donor antenna gain and minus a free space loss factor. The free space loss factor shall be -93 dB for a distance of one mile to the nearest Hennepin East base radio location, adjusted by 6 dB each time the distance is halved or doubled. The acceptable range for passing shall be between -65 and -95 dBm. 
b.  Gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish, the gain values. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-219. - Annual tests. 
    When an in-building radio system is required, the building owner shall test all active components of the system, including but not limited to amplifiers, power supplies and backup batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that, they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one-hour test period, in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the intended purpose. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-220. - Five-year tests. 
    In addition to the annual test, the building owner shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every five years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test. A radio test shall also be performed whenever there is a change in or to the building that may have an impact on coverage. Examples of the types of changes that may change radio coverage are interior remodeling that adds and/or changes partitions, removal of windows, and the addition of metalized treatment to window surfaces. The procedure described in section 18-218(a)(1) shall be used for these tests. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-221. - Qualifications of testing personnel. 
    All tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by qualified and competent personnel that includes: persons in possession of a current FCC license, or a current technician certification issued by the Associated Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO) or the Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA), or a qualified radio engineer licensed as a registered professional engineer by the State of Minnesota. Testing personnel shall have test equipment that is appropriate for the testing procedure, and that test equipment shall have been calibrated within six months prior to the testing. All test records shall be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy shall be submitted to fire department officials. 
(Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 2-6-2006) 
Sec. 18-222. - Field testing. 
    Fire and police personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or the owner's representative, shall have the right to enter onto the property to conduct testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present.

(3)  Present a potential safety hazard. 
(4)  Be detrimental to fish or wildlife habitat or protected vegetation. 
(b)  Shape and dimensions. 
(1)  No dock shall exceed six feet in width and 75 feet in length as measured from the water's edge. The width (but not the length) of the crossbar of any T-shaped or L-shaped dock shall be included in the computation of length described in the preceding sentence. In the event the water's edge is measured from emergent aquatic vegetation, the dock length, shape and dimension shall be configured so as to minimize impact on the lake and prevents safety hazards. 
(2)  The crossbars of any such dock shall not measure in excess of 25 feet in length. 
(3)  The end segment of a dock may be of a square design up to eight feet wide. 
(4)  No more than two crossbars shall be allowed on each dock. 
(c)  Encroachment in setback zone; common docks. No dock and/or water trampoline shall encroach upon any dock setback zone; provided, however, that the owners of any two abutting lakeshore sites may erect one common dock within the dock setback zone appurtenant to the abutting lakeshore sites, if the common dock is the only dock on the two lakeshore sites and if the dock otherwise conforms with the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Permitted number of docks. No more than one dock shall be permitted on any lakeshore site. 
(e)  Location on or near public property. All private docks, moorings and buoys are prohibited on public property or within the extended property lines of any such property for a distance of 100 feet from the ordinary high-water mark of such property without written permission of the governmental subdivision having title to the property. 
(f)  Reserved. This subsection reserved for future use. 
(g)  Materials and construction; maintenance. Docks, moorings and other structures may be constructed of such materials and in such a manner as the owner determines, provided that they shall be so built and maintained that they do not constitute a nuisance to the public using the waters of the lake and they shall be maintained in a workmanlike manner and shall be in good repair. 
(h)  Electrical systems. Any electrical use on dock facilities must meet all appropriate electrical and building codes. 
(i)  Storage of fuel; fueling facilities. No person shall store fuel upon any dock, and the installation of fueling facilities on any dock, mooring or other structure is prohibited.

(k)  Commercial boat launches. No boat launch shall be established for commercial purposes without approval of the city council. 
(l)  Swimming rafts and water trampolines. All swimming rafts and water trampolines shall obtain the proper permits from the county, if required, prior to installation, shall be located within 100 feet from shore, shall not be used for mooring except by persons using the raft or water trampoline for its defined purpose, and shall be limited to no more than one per lakeshore site.

(n)  Removal during winter months. All structures except docks in the waters of any lake, whether floating or on posts, shall be removed from the lake before November 1 of each year and remain out of the water until April 1 of the following year.

(p)  Intent of location restrictions. The purpose of the dock location regulations of this section is the safe and orderly use of lake waters, understanding that each owner of a lakeshore site may want to extend a dock into such water. Such regulations are based upon certain assumptions such as, but not limited to, fairly uniform property widths around a lake in dimensions that accommodate the placement of a dock without encroachment upon dock setback zones or over the extended property lines of a neighboring property, and are based upon the assumption that neighbors can work together regarding issues of dock placement. The requirements of subsections (a)(2), (c) and (f) of this section shall not apply in those situations where it is impossible for one or more owners of lakeshore sites in proximity to one another to each place a dock in conformity therewith due to configurations unique to one or more of their sites.

(g)  Revocation of permit. 
(1)  If any permitted water obstacle is found by the council to constitute a hazard or obstruction to the safe use of the lake by others, the permit may be revoked. This remedy shall be in addition to any criminal remedies available pursuant to this article. 
(2)  The permittee shall be given written notice of the hearing at which the council shall consider the revocation, such notice to be received by the permittee at least ten days before the hearing. If the permittee cannot be found, notice shall be sufficient if delivered to the address of the applicant or permittee as set forth in the permit application.

Where shopping center facilities or industrial parks cover more than 40 acres of land, up to two freestanding signs and one wall area identification sign may be displayed in accordance with the maximum sign size provisions for area identification signs in the applicable zoning district. 
(d)  Sign packages. 
(1)  Authorized; purpose. A developer or subsequent owner of a project may submit and the city council may approve, only if it does so by a four-fifths vote, a comprehensive sign package or amendment thereto for an entire B, I, FF or PUD development. Such sign package shall set down the standards guiding the installation of all signs within the development. 
(2)  Design standards. 
a.  The sign package may adopt portions of this chapter by reference, but shall be expected to result in a more integrated sign design for the development than could be required by this chapter. 
b.  The city council may vary any of the requirements of this chapter in a sign package either by allowing more or larger signs, or by requiring fewer or smaller signs, or by any combination of the two. 
c.  If the city council determines that a sign package does not provide a more integrated sign design it may decline to approve by a four-fifths vote the sign package, in which case this chapter would apply to signs within the development. 
d.  If the sign package approved by the city council is unacceptable to the developer, the developer may choose to have this chapter serve as the sign control for the development. 
(3)  Applicability of sign package. Once one sign is erected under the requirements of a sign package, the sign package shall be the control for all signs in the development unless both the developer or subsequent owner of a project and the city council agree to revert to the requirements of this chapter.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 28-1. - Street lighting. 
(a)  Procedure for installation. 
(1)  Council action. The council shall determine by resolution, from time to time, the streets, alleys or other public or private areas on which the city shall install and operate street lighting systems. Before any such service is furnished pursuant to such resolutions, the clerk shall, under the council's direction, publish notice that the council will meet to consider such projects. Such notice shall be published in the official newspaper at least once no less than ten days prior to such meeting of the council and shall state the date, time and place of such meeting, the streets, alleys or other public and private areas affected and the particular projects proposed, and the estimated cost of each project, either in total, on the basis of the proposed assessment per front foot, or otherwise. 
(2)  Public hearing. At such hearing or at any adjournment thereof, the council shall hear property owners with reference to the scope and desirability of the proposed projects. The council shall thereupon adopt a resolution confirming the original projects with such modifications as it considers desirable. The council shall provide for the furnishing of such service by contract or in such manner as it deems proper. 
(3)  Waiver of public hearing. Whenever 100 percent of the fee owners of one or more subdivisions, duly platted or in the process of platting, shall desire to have a street lighting system within all or a portion of the subdivision, all of the fee owners may execute a waiver of the hearing requirement set forth in this section. Upon the city's receipt of the executed waiver by all fee owners having an interest in the subdivision, the city council may at its discretion order the installation of a street lighting system within the subdivision. Payment of all charges and assessments made by the city for the street lighting system which are thereafter made against the properties within the subdivision shall be the obligation of the property owner who is the owner of record at the time the charges are made. 
(b)  Record of costs. The clerk shall keep a record of the costs of operation of the street lighting system, including clerical, administrative and incidental costs, and the portion of the costs properly attributable to each lot and parcel of property benefitted by the street lighting system, whether or not the property abuts on the street, alley or other public or private area in which the system is located, based upon the benefits received. All such costs shall be collected in the manner provided in this section. 
(c)  Billing; late charge; collection of unpaid charges. 
(1)  The clerk or duly authorized agents shall determine the fair and equitable share of the total costs of the system to be applied to each benefitted property and shall prepare a quarterly billing and mail the bill to the property owner of each and every property benefitted by this street lighting system as has been determined by the council. The amount that shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the clerk shall be paid not later than the 15th day of the following month. 
(2)  In addition to the charges provided for in subsection (c)(1) of this section, there shall be a late charge as set forth in section 16-35 for payments made after the 15th day of the following month for streetlight services used during the previous quarter. 
(3)  When a charge is more than 45 days past due, civil action may be begun on behalf of the city for the collection of the street lighting service charge, and if such charge is not paid within 60 days after due, the unpaid charge plus penalty may be certified to the county auditor with the taxes against such property and shall be collected with other taxes on such property. 
(4)  All accounts shall be carried in the name of the owner of the property. Upon request by the owner, the annual bill for street lighting service may be billed to the occupant of the premises served. The owner of the premises, however, shall remain the principal obligor and the billing of an occupant of the premises shall not relieve the principal obligor of payment responsibility if the occupant fails to pay the billing. 
(d)  Assessments for unpaid charges. Annually, the clerk shall list the total unpaid charges for each type of current service against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this section. The council may spread the charges, together with a certification processing fee in the amount set forth in section 16-32, against property benefitted as a special assessment under Minn. Stats. § 429.101 and other pertinent statutes, for certification to the county auditor and collection the following year along with current taxes.

(b)  Permit required. No person shall, directly or indirectly, give, hold, participate in or conduct a parade on public streets unless the person giving or sponsoring the same, or in charge thereof, shall have first obtained a permit from the council. 
(c)  Permit application. Every person desiring a permit shall make application upon forms furnished by the city and shall, except in case of renewal of an existing permit, be accompanied by all information required by the city to support the application including, but not limited to, affidavits requested by the city to show that the applicant is a person of good moral character and reputation and has not been convicted of a felony, gross misdemeanor or other crime involving moral turpitude within a five-year period prior to the making of the application. 
(d)  Issuance or denial of permit. The council may at its discretion issue or deny a permit based upon the application and other information presented to it. 
(1)  A permit shall not be issued if the parade is likely to become a public nuisance, significantly impair the flow of traffic, or otherwise endanger the public health, safety or welfare. 
(2)  A permit shall be subject to reasonable conditions imposed by the city council to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

If such person fails or refuses to remove such obstruction or encumbrance within a reasonable time, such obstruction or encumbrance may be removed by municipal employees, upon the order of the clerk, and they shall make an itemized account of the expenses, if any, incurred in or by reason of such removal and shall verify such account and file it with the clerk, and such expense shall be paid out of the general fund of the city, which expense may be recovered from the owner of such materials by sending an invoice and, upon council order, by a civil suit.

    Whoever shall fail to comply with or in any way violate the provisions of this article or whoever shall affix to or display upon any house or building any numbers other than those assigned to it, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance with section 1-13. Each and every day that such failure to comply exists shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 2, 5-6-2013) 
Sec. 28-62. - Street naming system. 
    Streets and roadways within the corporate limits of the city shall be named similarly to the predominate county system as follows: 
(1)  North-south streets. 
a.  Commencing at the east boundary of the city and proceeding west, all north-south streets or roadways shall be constructed approximately every 330 feet, more or less, and shall have, in alphabetical order, a name corresponding with names used in neighboring communities and which generally adhere to a county type system. All such streets shall be referred to as "lanes." 
b.  Addresses on the east side of a lane shall end in an even number and addresses on the west side of a lane shall end in an odd number. 
c.  The block number system, commencing with the 6200 block at the most southerly point of the city (all property north of 62nd Avenue and south of 63rd Avenue or extensions thereof), shall be used to designate addresses on lanes. Proceeding north, block numbers (addresses) shall be increased sequentially by 100 at every avenue or extension thereof (approximately every 660 feet, more or less) as more fully set forth in subsection (2) of this section. Address numbers on lanes shall increase as one proceeds northward from the avenue designating the block number. 
(2)  East-west streets. 
a.  Commencing at the south boundary of the city and proceeding north there shall be east-west streets intersecting with the lanes described in subsection (1) of this section approximately every 330 feet, more or less, and the east-west streets shall be alternately named "Avenues," beginning with 62nd Avenue, and "Places," commencing with 62nd Place. 62nd Avenue shall be the most southerly east-west street in the city, with 62nd Place the next east-west street to the north. 
b.  Addresses on the north side of an avenue or place shall end in an even number, while addresses on the south side of an avenue or place shall end in an odd number. 
c.  The block number system, commencing at the most easterly boundary of the city with the 9500 block (all property west of such boundary and east of Lancaster Lane) and proceeding westward shall be used to designate addresses on avenues and places. Proceeding west, block numbers (addresses) on avenues and places shall increase sequentially by 100 at every lane or the extension thereof, beginning with 9500 on the most easterly boundary of the city. 
(3)  62nd Avenue and 63rd Avenue. There is an irregularity in the overall system in that the distance between 62nd Avenue and 63rd Avenue is more than 1,320 feet. Despite this discrepancy, the previously identified 63rd Avenue shall continue to be known as 63rd Avenue regardless of the location of or identification of any street or roadway as 62nd Place. The alternating pattern established in subsection (2) of this section in which avenues and places are established approximately every 330 feet, more or less, shall thereafter be followed as set forth in this section. 
(4)  Suffix. The city, being a continuation of North Minneapolis, shall further add the suffix "North" to all addresses. 
(5)  Other names. Because the grid system established in this section is not always applicable for curvilinear or meandering streets, the city shall also allow a system of streets which shall be designated with unique names. Addresses on such streets shall be taken from the grid system as much as possible and shall be a continuation of the applicable north-south or east-west system throughout its length. Unique streets include, but are not limited to, East Fish Lake Road, Weaver Lake Road, Eagle Lake Drive, and Boundary Creek Terrace.

(b)  No right-of-way permit shall be issued without payment of all fees required prior to the issuance of such a permit. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 2, 5-6-2013) 
Sec. 28-105. - Restoration of right-of-way. 
(a)  The work to be done under the permit and the restoration of the right-of-way as required in this article must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under subsection 28-107(b), all in the sole determination of the city. In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed before the commencement of the work, and must inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 24 months thereafter. If a new firm disturbs a work area for which a permit was previously granted, the firm shall assume responsibility for the restoration work for 24 months thereafter. 
(b)  The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and in compliance with Minnesota Rules 7819.1100. The city shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The city, in exercising this authority, shall be guided but not limited by the following standards and considerations: 
(1)  The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; 
(2)  The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way, and the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; 
(3)  The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way, and the remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; 
(4)  Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and 
(5)  The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the maximum limits of restoration methods and area requirements the city will impose are found in PUC plates 1 to 13, shown in parts 7819.9900 to 7819.9950 of the Minnesota Public Utility Commission Rules. 
(c)  If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city at its option may perform or cause to be performed such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the performance and restoration surety.

(1)  Every permanent extension of any distribution lines, circuits, and systems and any service lateral providing permanent electric power service, communication service or other associated utility services shall be installed underground when for: 
a.  Any new installation of buildings, signs, streetlights or other structures where the service lateral is street fed. 
b.  Any new subdivision. 
c.  Any new development or industrial park containing new commercial or industrial buildings. The cost of underground installation shall not be charged to the city. 
d.  Any that are newly installed, constructed or otherwise placed in the public right-of-way, or in other public property, except such requirement may be waived by the engineer when it is not technically or economically feasible and does not include collocation of small wireless facilities approved by the city and in compliance with chapter 28, article IV. 
(2)  Any permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of more than 400 yards of any distribution line, circuit or system of any such utility and any service lateral shall be installed underground when for or made in connection with street paving, street widening, public utility installation and other such projects. The cost of underground installation shall not be charged to the city. Such requirements may be waived by the engineer when it is not technically or economically feasible. 
(3)  Wherever any part or portion of the distribution system of any such utilities in an area or district of the city is now located underground, such part or portion shall remain underground and any replacement, relocation, reconstruction, repair and extension thereof shall be installed underground. The cost of underground installation shall not be charged to the city.

Sec. 30-11. - Premature subdivisions. 
(a)  Any proposed subdivision requiring council approval pursuant to this chapter and deemed premature for development shall not be approved by the city council. A subdivision shall be deemed premature if, in the council's opinion, any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Lack of adequate drainage. 
a.  A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate drainage to serve the subdivision when: 
1.  Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it constitutes a hazard to the stability of proposed structures; 
2.  The proposed subdivision will cause pollution of water sources or surrounding damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land; or 
3.  The proposed site grading and development will cause harmful and irreparable damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land. 
b.  In making these determinations, the planning commission and city council shall consider such factors as the average rainfall for the area, the relation of the land to floodplains, the nature of soils and subsoils and the slope of the land and their ability to adequately support surface water runoff and structures, the presence of streams, and compliance with or ability to comply with chapter 14, article IV. 
(2)  Lack of adequate water supply. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate water supply when public water is not available to serve the proposed subdivision. 
(3)  Lack of adequate streets. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate streets to serve the subdivision when: 
a.  Streets which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance or surface condition that the traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a nuisance (including, but not limited to, maintenance concerns), or a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or would seriously aggravate an existing hazardous or nuisance condition, and when, with due regard to the advice of county bureau of public services, department of public works, the streets are inadequate for the intended use; or 
b.  The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create congestion or unsafe conditions on streets existing or proposed at the time of the application. 
(4)  Lack of adequate waste disposal systems. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate waste disposal systems if: 
a.  Sanitary sewer is neither available nor proposed; or 
b.  Available or proposed sanitary sewer is inadequate to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, planned public facilities, and commercial and industrial development projected for the next five years. 
(5)  Inconsistency with comprehensive plan. A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives, and recommendations of the duly adopted comprehensive plan of the city, as may be amended. Application for rezoning may be made at the time of subdivision application, but the latter will not be deemed accepted or acceptable until and unless any necessary rezoning is approved by the council. 
(6)  Lack of public improvements. A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if public improvements or facilities reasonably necessitated by the subdivision, and which must be provided at public expense, cannot be reasonably provided for within 24 months from the date the application for preliminary plat approval is filed and complete. 
(7)  Inconsistency with environmental requirements. A proposed subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the rules and policies of the state environmental quality board, as may be amended, and could adversely impact critical environmental areas or potentially disrupt or destroy, in violation of federal and state historical preservation laws, historic areas which are designated or officially recognized by the city council. 
(8)  Infrastructure point system . Before application for subdivision shall be considered or processed for areas that were previously subject to the Maple Grove Staging Plan, application shall be made for evaluation under the infrastructure point system by the city engineer and/or public works director. Any application for subdivision not obtaining a passing score under the infrastructure point system shall be considered premature and shall not be considered or processed. 
(b)  The burden shall be upon the applicant to show that the proposed subdivision is not premature and that it relates well with existing or potential adjacent subdivisions and the city's development plans.

(1)  If all requirements of this chapter and as additionally imposed by the planning commission are complied with, the council shall act upon the preliminary plat and may impose conditions and restrictions which are deemed necessary within 120 days following delivery of an application and written acknowledgment by the city that the application is in compliance with this Code, unless an extension of the review period has been agreed to by the applicant. If the council fails to approve or disapprove the preliminary plat within such period, the preliminary plat shall be deemed approved and upon demand the city shall execute a certificate to that effect. 
(2)  If the preliminary plat is approved by the city council or by act of law, the subdivider must submit the final plat within one year after such approval or, subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 3c, and subject to the following, approval of the preliminary plat shall be void:

b.  The zoning administrator shall place the subdivider's request on the agenda of a regularly scheduled council meeting to be held within 30 days of such filing if in his opinion no change has occurred in any land use restriction or the comprehensive plan, or any other official control affecting the use, development density, lot size, lot layout, or dedication or platting required or permitted by the approved preliminary plat. If good cause is shown, the council may grant the extension. The request may be approved by the council as an item on its consent agenda. 
c.  Only one such extension request may be made. 
d.  Failure to file an extension request in a timely fashion, or the change of any restriction or control referred to in (f)(2)b of this section will require the submission of a new application for subdivision approval.

(Code 1984, § 350:21; Ord. No. 04-04, § 1, 2-2-2004) 
Sec. 30-17. - Design standards for preliminary plats, final plats, and subdivisions. 
    Design standards for preliminary plats, final plats, and subdivisions are as follows: 
(1)  Blocks. 
a.  Block length. 
1.  In general, intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. 
2.  Where no existing plats control, blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. 
3.  In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block. 
b.  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots having a depth appropriate to the applicable zoning district as suggested by the minimum lot requirements for that zoning district. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their anticipated use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. 
(2)  Lots. 
a.  Minimum area and width. The minimum lot area and width shall not be less than that established by the zoning regulations of chapter 36 in effect at the time of the most current completed application for preliminary plat of the affected property. This requirement shall not apply to property used or to be used for a public purpose such as, but not limited to, a well site or park. 
b.  Ratio of depth to width. No lot shall be more than four times as deep as it is wide. Those portions of a lot within any abutting wetland, public water, or steep slopes of the type described in subsection (7)c of this section shall be ignored when determining whether the lot complies with this ratio. 
c.  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have such dimensions as to permit building setback from both streets as required in chapter 36. 
d.  Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
e.  Frontage. Every lot must have frontage on a public street. 
f.  Watercourses. Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall have additional depth and width, as required under the provisions of chapter 36 for the floodplain, shoreland and wetland systems districts. 
g.  Preservation of special features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as trees, wetlands, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which if preserved will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development. 
h.  Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as separate parcels or platted as outlots. 
i.  Tax district boundaries. No lot shall extend over a tax district boundary without approval of the affected district tax authorities. 
j.  Through lots. Through lots shall not be permitted except where lots back on major streets, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. To allow space for screen planting along the back lot line, such lots, where allowed, shall have an additional depth of at least 20 feet beyond the lot depth appropriate to the applicable zoning district as suggested by the minimum lot requirements for that zoning district. 
k.  Access restrictions. No residential lots shall receive direct access from a high volume collector or greater volume street, nor shall any commercial or industrial lot receive direct access from a minor arterial street or a street of greater volume. 
(3)  Streets, alleys and sidewalks. 
a.  Continuity and arrangement of streets. Except for culs-de-sac, streets shall connect with dedicated or existing streets on adjoining or adjacent lands, or provide for future connections to adjoining lands, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets on the nearest properties. The arrangement of streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of stormwater, and to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served. 
b.  Local streets and dead-end streets. 
1.  Local streets should be so planned so as to discourage their use by non-local traffic. Permanent dead-end streets are prohibited, but culs-de-sac may be permitted if not contrary to public health, safety, welfare or convenience. 
2.  Culs-de-sac shall not be longer than 500 feet. The length shall be measured from the centerline of the adjoining street to the center of the turnaround. 
3.  The cul-de-sac shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet. Where the street right-of-way intersects the cul-de-sac right-of-way, a 30-foot radius is required. 
c.  Width of right-of-way. Right-of-way shall be dedicated in the following minimum widths. The city engineer may require such additional right-of-way as he determines will be necessary as a result of approval of the subdivision either standing alone or as a part of a group of subdivisions over time. 
1.  Local street: 60 feet. 
2.  Minor collector street: 80 feet. 
3.  Major collector street: 100 feet. 
4.  Minor arterial street: 120 feet. 
d.  Railroad crossings. Dedication of sufficient land, as determined by the city council, to ensure a safe view will be required before the city will accept any street dedication requiring a crossing of a railroad. An indication in writing from the public utilities commission that a crossing permit may be granted shall also be submitted before the preliminary plat can be approved. 
e.  Street intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be 80 degrees. Street intersections less than 125 feet apart, as measured from right-of-way to right-of-way, shall be avoided. 
f.  Subdivisions abutting major rights-of-way. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, or railroad, provision shall be made for a frontage road approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way, provided that due consideration is given to proper traffic circulation. Such frontage roads shall be located at a distance from the rights-of-way suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations, or for lot depths. 
g.  Sidewalks. A paved sidewalk or pedestrian pathway not less than five feet in width is required on each side of the paved surface of any street to be constructed. See section 14-128 and the city's approved standard specifications adopted by the city council pursuant thereto. When a sidewalk parallels a street ending in a cul-de-sac, the sidewalk need not encircle the cul-de-sac but may continue upon its parallel course until it intersects with the pavement of the cul-de-sac and may there terminate. 
h.  Alleys. 
1.  Except where justified by special conditions related to the health, safety, welfare or convenience of the public, alleys will not be approved. 
2.  Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than 30 feet wide. 
3.  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided wherever possible, but, if unavoidable, such dead-end alleys may be approved if adequate turnaround facilities are provided at the closed end. 
i.  Half streets. Dedication of half streets shall not be approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with the other requirements of this chapter, where it is found that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, or where it becomes necessary to acquire the remaining half by condemnation so that it may be improved in the public interest. 
j.  Compliance with city transportation plan. For all public ways hereafter dedicated and/or accepted, the minimum right-of-way, curve radius, curb radius, surfaced width and design standards for streets, alleys and pedestrian ways included in any subdivision shall be in accordance with the city's transportation plan, as amended, and subject to the approval of the city engineer. 
k.  Street grades. Except upon the recommendation of the city engineer that the topography warrants a greater maximum, the maximum grade for boulevards perpendicular to the right-of-way shall be four percent, the maximum grade for culs-de-sac shall be six percent, and the maximum grade for all other grades in all streets and alleys in any subdivision shall be eight percent. In addition, there shall be a minimum longitudinal grade on all streets, including culs-de-sac, of not less than 0.5 percent. 
l.  Reverse curves. Tangents of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on collector streets. 
m.  Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited. 
n.  Horizontal curves. Local street horizontal curves shall be at least 125 feet in centerline radius, for curves having internal angles of not more than 90 degrees. Where the internal angle exceeds 90 degrees, the minimum curve radius shall be 75 feet. The horizontal curves for collector or greater volume streets shall meet the minimum design criteria for the design speed of the street in accordance with municipal state aid standards. 
(4)  Easements. 
a.  Width and location. An easement for utilities and drainage at least ten feet wide along the front lot line and five feet wide along side and rear lot lines shall be provided. If necessary for the extension of main water or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots. 
b.  Continuity. Utility and drainage easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of the city council after a public hearing. 
c.  Easements along watercourses and drainage channels. Easements shall be provided along each side of the centerline of any watercourse or drainage channel, whether or not shown in the comprehensive plan, to a width sufficient in the judgment of the city council to provide proper maintenance and protection and to provide for stormwater runoff and installation and maintenance of storm sewers, and they shall be dedicated to the city by appropriate language in the owner's certificate. 
(5)  Erosion and sediment control. The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion. Also see subsection 30-22(a)(6). 
(6)  Drainage. 
a.  Where municipal storm sewer systems do not exist, or the introduction of such public system is deemed inappropriate by the city council, provisions for stormwater drainage shall be consistent with the city's storm drainage plan, as amended, and be subject to the review of the city engineer, who shall report to the city council on the feasibility of the plan presented. 
b.  No plat, subdivision or development on land subject to this section shall be approved before an adequate stormwater disposal plan is approved by the city engineer and council, and approval of grade and drainage requirements shall be at the applicant's expense. The use of dry wells for the purpose of stormwater disposal is prohibited. 
c.  No buildable portion of a subdivision shall be approved on land subject to flooding or containing poor drainage facilities, and on land which would make adequate drainage of the streets and lots impossible. However, if the applicant agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the city engineer, make the area completely safe for residential occupancy or provide adequate street and lot drainage and conform to applicable regulations of other agencies such as the U.S. Corps of Engineers, or the state department of natural resources, the final plat of the subdivision may be approved. In addition, such plats may not be approved if the cost of providing municipal services to protect the floodplain area would impose an unreasonable economic burden upon the city. 
(7)  Protected areas. 
a.  Where land proposed for subdivision contains drainageways, watercourses, floodable areas, wetlands or steep slopes, and thus may be unsuitable for development, the platting and development of those areas shall be consistent with limitations presented by such conditions. 
b.  Subdivisions shall be designed so that at least 75 percent of the minimum lot area is free of wetland soil types, water bodies, watercourses, drainageways or floodway areas, or steep slopes (over 18 percent). 
c.  No construction or grading shall be allowed on slopes steeper than 18 percent in grade over a horizontal distance of 50 feet. 
d.  For land in the S shoreland district, steep slopes shall be defined as set forth in 36-3. 
(Code 1984, § 350:24; Ord. No. 16-01, § 1, 1-4-2016) 
Sec. 30-18. - Provision of land for public use. 
(a)  Required. Pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 2b, except as otherwise provided in this section, the city requires all owners or developers, as a prerequisite to approval of a plat, subdivision or development of any land, to convey to the city, or dedicate to the public use, a reasonable portion of any such proposal for public use as streets, roads, sewers, electric, gas and water facilities, stormwater drainage and holding areas or ponds, similar utilities and improvements, or parks, playgrounds, trails or open space, such portions to be approved and acceptable to the city. 
(b)  Suitability of dedicated land. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for its proposed use and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas shall include size, shape, topography, geology, tree cover, access and location. 
(c)  Park dedication requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subdividers and developers of land within the city shall be required to dedicate to the city for park, playground, trail and public open space purposes the following minimum amounts of land or cash, or both, whichever the city, at its option, shall require. The required dedication shall be made prior to the city's release of the final plat for filing. Subdividers and developers may, however, pay the park dedication fee at any time after the final plat has been approved by the city council. The amount of any required cash contribution shall be calculated based upon rates established by the city and in effect as of the date of the release of the final plat for filing. For purposes of this subsection (c), words such as, but not limited to, "total acreage," "subdivision area," "the property in the plat, subdivision or development," and "the property being platted," whenever such words appear in this subsection or any resolution or policy adopted pursuant thereto, shall mean the gross area of the plat, subdivision or development except any undeveloped outlot that will, by current standards, be required to make the dedication required in this subsection at such time as the outlot is developed, subdivided or platted in the future. 
(1)  Residential dedications. 
a.  Land shall be dedicated pursuant to the following schedule, wherein density is calculated by considering the total acreage of the entire plat, subdivision or development being considered: 
Dwelling Units per Gross Acre Dedication Requirement Less than 9 10 percent of subdivision area 9 and more 11 percent of subdivision area plus an additional 1 percent for each additional dwelling unit per acre over 9  
The following schedules shall apply in the specific situations listed below: 
1.  Developments that include affordable units (affordable as determined by the city) shall receive a 25 percent reduction from the single unit rate for each affordable unit. 
2.  Developments with multiple dwelling structures that have a density of 14 units per acre, a minimum of eight units per structure and has a common internal access corridor for all units shall receive a 20 percent reduction from the single unit rate for each unit that satisfies the above. 
3.  Developments that include memory care and assisted living units shall apply the commercial rate to the percentage of memory care and/or assisted living units that are in the project multiplied by the project net acres. 
The above schedules shall not be utilized cumulatively. 
b.  A cash contribution in lieu of land dedication may be required at the discretion of the city. The cash contribution shall be calculated by the city estimating the fair market value per acre of residential property in the city, and such value shall then be multiplied by ten percent and the resulting figure divided by the average density of residential development existing in the city. The city shall establish the cash contribution by resolution, which shall not exceed the above calculation. 
c.  The city may require the subdivider or developer to make a combination cash and land dedication pursuant to the following formula: 
1.  The amount of land which could be required in accordance with this chapter shall be calculated. 
2.  From the total calculated under subsection c.1 of this subsection, the actual amount of land the city determines to be needed to fulfill the purposes of this subsection c shall be subtracted. 
3.  The balance arrived at under subsection c.2 of this subsection shall be converted into a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication pursuant to a standard formula established by the city, which formula takes into consideration such things as, but not necessarily limited to, the fair market value of the property in the plat, subdivision or development and the percentage of the total park dedication obligation represented by such balance. 
(2)  Commercial and industrial dedication requirements. 
a.  Land dedication, if required, shall be 71/2 percent of the subdivision or development. 
b.  If the city requires payment of fees in lieu of land dedication, that fee shall be based upon the same percentage set forth in subsection a of this subsection, multiplied by the acreage of the proposed plat, development or subdivision, and by the council's estimate, as established at least annually by resolution, of the fair market value per acre of undeveloped commercial/industrial land in the community. 
c.  Where a combination land and cash dedication is made, the lands dedicated will be deducted from the total park dedication land requirement, and the balance of required dedication acreage will be multiplied by the current council estimate established pursuant to subsection b of this subsection to determine the amount of cash dedication. 
(3)  Miscellaneous requirements. The following requirements apply to all dedications or conveyances for park, playground, trail or public open space purposes: 
a.  Suitability of land. Land conveyed or dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (c) must be located outside of drainageways, floodplains and ponding areas after the site has been developed. 
b.  Installation of improvements. As part of their development contract or site plan approval responsibilities, owners and developers shall be responsible for making certain improvements to the developments for park, playground, trail and public open space purposes, including, but not limited to, finished grading and ground cover for all park, playground, trail and public open spaces within their developments. 
c.  Standards for location. 
1.  The park board shall develop and recommend to the city council for adoption standards and guidelines for determining what geographic location of each such development should reasonably be required to be so conveyed or dedicated. 
2.  Such standards and guidelines may take into consideration the zoning classification to be assigned to the land to be developed, the particular use proposed for such land, amenities to be provided and factors of density and site development as proposed by the owners or developers. 
3.  The park board shall further recommend changes and amendments from time to time to such standards and guidelines to reflect changes in the usage of land which may occur, changes in zoning classifications and concepts, and changes in planning and development concepts that relate to the development and usages to which land may be put. 
d.  Park board recommendations. The park board shall, in each case, recommend to the city council the total area and location of such land that the park board feels should be so conveyed or dedicated within the development for park or playground purposes. 
e.  Acquisition of sites proposed on official map or comprehensive plan. Where a proposed park, playground, trail, open space or other recreational area that has been indicated on the official map and/or comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, such proposed site shall be designated as such and be dedicated to the city. If the subdivider chooses not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required under this section for such proposed site, the council shall not be required to act to approve or disapprove the plat of the subdivision for a period of 90 days after the subdivider meets all the provisions of this chapter, in order to permit the council to consider the proposed plat and to take the necessary steps to acquire, through purchase or condemnation, all or part of the public site proposed on the official map or comprehensive plan. 
f.  Density and open space requirements under zoning regulations. Land area so conveyed or dedicated for park, playground, trail and open space purposes may not be used by an owner or developer as an allowance for purposes of calculating the density requirements of the development as set out in chapter 36 and shall be in addition to and not in lieu of open space requirements for planned unit developments pursuant to chapter 36. 
g.  Private open space. Where private open space for park, playground, trail, open space or other recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, such areas may be used for credit at the discretion of the city council against the requirement of dedication for purposes described in this subsection (c), provided the city council finds it is in the public interest to do so and that the following standards are met: 
1.  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space required to be maintained by the zoning and building regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; 
2.  The private ownership and maintenance of the open space shall be adequately provided for by written agreement; 
3.  The private open space shall be restricted for park, playground, trail, open space or recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be eliminated without the consent of the city council; 
4.  The proposed private open space must be reasonably adaptable for use for such purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land; 
5.  Facilities proposed for such purposes must be in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the comprehensive plan, and be approved by the city council; and 
6.  Where such credit is granted, the amount of credit shall not exceed 25 percent of the amount calculated in subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable. 
h.  Disposition of cash contributions. The park board shall establish a separate fund into which all cash contributions received from owners and developers in lieu of conveyance or dedication of land for park, playground, trail and open space purposes shall be deposited. The park board shall establish separate budgeting and accounting procedures for such fund and shall make from time to time appropriations from such fund for acquisition of land for such purposes, for developing existing park, playground, trail and open space sites or for debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for such purposes. 
i.  Administrative procedures. The park board shall establish such administrative procedures as it may deem necessary and required to implement the provisions of this subsection (c). 
(4)  Determination of land type. The determination of whether land is residential, commercial, or industrial shall be based upon the zoning of the particular land for which dedication is required. Zoning classifications shall be categorized as follows: 
Zoning Land Type R-A, R-1, R-2, R-2b, R-3, R-4, R-5 Residential B, FF Commercial I Industrial Planned unit development (PUD), FP, S, and W See underlying zoning classification PUD district See major use approved when zoned PUD  
(5)  Waivers. The park dedication requirement may be waived by the city council in connection with lands described in subsections a and b of this subsection, subject to the requirements of subsections c and d of this subsection. Such lands include: 
a.  Land owned by a government or governmental subdivision, which land is or will be devoted to a public purpose; and 
b.  Privately owned land that is intended to be maintained or developed so as to contain on at least 90 percent of the gross subdivision area large park-like areas open to use by the public such as a golf course. 
c.  Prior to subdivision approval and any such waiver, the property owner (public or private) must present to the city in recordable form a covenant running with the land and satisfactory to the city wherein the owner agrees for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to make park dedication for the land according to prevailing requirements at the time dedication is required in any of the following circumstances: 
1.  Whenever public lands or uses or portions thereof which are otherwise exempt become privately owned and do not or will not meet the 90 percent requirement set forth in this subsection, as measured at the time of the covenant; 
2.  Whenever more than ten percent of the gross subdivision area of any privately owned property, as measured at the time of the covenant, becomes developed so as to prevent the public by design or implication from unrestricted access to the land; or 
3.  If the actual or intended use of the land changes so as to be inconsistent with the types of public activities and uses set forth in this subsection. 
d.  The covenant referred to in subsection c of this subsection shall be filed in the office of the county recorder at the owner's expense at or before the recording of the plat by which the subdivision is accomplished. 
(Code 1984, § 350:27; Ord. No. 04-25, § 1, 12-6-2004; Ord. No. 08-14, § 1, 11-3-2008) 
Sec. 30-19. - Review, approval and recording of final plat. 
(a)  Application for review. 
(1)  Within one year after preliminary plat approval, an application for final plat review, application fee as established in chapter 16, article XI, and final plat with required content and submittals as specified in section 30-20 shall be delivered to the zoning administrator or else preliminary plat approval will expire. 
(2)  The application and required submittals shall be delivered at least 14 days prior to the regular city council meeting at which it will be scheduled. 
(3)  The application shall be considered as being officially delivered when all the information requirements are complied with. 
(b)  City council action. Upon receipt of a completed application for final plat, the zoning administrator shall schedule it for consideration in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section, distribute the final plat to appropriate staff and review agencies and arrange for the preparation of a report to assist in arriving at a recommendation to the city council. 
(c)  Approval by city council. 
(1)  After review of the final plat by staff such final plat, together with the recommendations of staff, shall be submitted to the city council for consideration. 
(2)  The final plat shall conform to the approved preliminary plat except for any adjustments deemed to be minor by the zoning administrator. The city council may also require revisions in the final plat as it deems necessary for the health, safety and general welfare or convenience of the city. If any revision results in a significant change to the approved preliminary plat, the revisions shall be subject to a public hearing as prescribed in subsection 30-15(b). 
(3)  If accepted, the final plat shall be approved by resolution, which resolution shall provide for the acceptance of all agreements for basic improvements, public dedication and other requirements as indicated by the city council. 
(4)  If disapproved, the grounds for any refusal to approve a plat shall be set forth in the proceedings of the council and reported to the applicant. A final plat shall be disapproved if a mound management plan has not been approved by the city. 
(5)  If the council fails to approve the final plat within 60 days of the date the applicant has complied with all conditions and requirements of applicable regulations and all conditions and requirements upon which preliminary approval was expressly conditioned, either through performance or the execution of appropriate agreements assuring performance, the final plat shall be deemed approved, and upon demand the city shall execute a certificate to that effect. 
(6)  Written notification of the city council action shall be sent to the applicant within one week of such action. 
(d)  Recording. If the final plat is approved by the city council, or by act of law, the applicant shall record it with the county recorder within two years after such approval or, subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 3c, and subject to the following, approval of the plat shall be void. A final plat will not be released by the city for recording purposes until the applicant has satisfied the ministerial requirements of section 30-21. 
(1)  At any time within 30 days before such deadline, the subdivider may file with the zoning administrator a written request that the deadline be extended one year beyond the date the extension is granted. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall place the subdivider's request on the agenda of a regularly scheduled council meeting to be held within 30 days of such filing if in his opinion no change has occurred in any land use restriction or the comprehensive plan, or any other official control affecting the use, development density, lot size, lot layout, or dedication or platting required or permitted by the approved preliminary plat. If good cause is shown, the council may grant the extension. The request may be approved by the council as an item on its consent agenda. 
(3)  Only one such extension request may be made. 
(4)  The change of any restriction or control referred to in subsection (d)(2) of this section will require the submission of a new application for subdivision approval. 
(Code 1984, § 350:30; Ord. No. 04-09, § 2, 4-19-2004; Ord. No. 15-08, § 1, 5-4-2015) 
Sec. 30-20. - Data and certifications required for final plat. 
(a)  Format. The applicant shall submit 15 copies of the final plat, and 81/2-inch by 11-inch photographically reduced transparencies thereof, together with any necessary supplementary information. 
(b)  Contents. The final plat, prepared for recording purposes, shall be prepared in accordance with provisions of state statutes and county regulations, and such final plat shall contain the following information: 
(1)  The name of the subdivision, which shall not duplicate or too closely approximate the name of any existing subdivision within the county.

The following rates and charges for use and service of the sanitary sewer system are established in the amounts as set forth in chapter 16, article X, such charges and rates to be made against each lot, parcel of land, unit or premises which may have a connection directly or indirectly into the municipal sanitary sewer system and which discharges only normal sewage into such system: 
(1)  A minimum quarterly charge, whether use of water is metered or not. 
(2)  A flat charge where the rate is not based upon the metered use of water. 
(3)  Metered flow charges for all premises where the rate is to be based upon metered use of water. 
(b)  Industrial rates. On each lot, parcel, premises, or unit not enumerated under subsection (a) of this section the use of water shall be metered and the rate shall be the same as that provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, pertaining to metered flow charges. 
(c)  Metering of water use. A meter recording the use of water may be installed on any nonresidential lot, parcel, premises or unit enumerated in subsection (b) of this section, pertaining to industrial rates, and thereafter the rate shall be based upon such use of water. The council may, by resolution, require and order the installation of such meter on any such lot, parcel, premises, or unit or class thereof where it shall determine that the flat charges are impractical to apply or result in inequitable charges because insufficient or excessive, and thereafter the rate shall be based upon such use of water. 
(d)  Meter installation and maintenance. Any water meter installed for use or used as a basis for the computation of sewer rates shall be installed and maintained in good operating condition at all times, such installation and maintenance to be without expense to the city. Any such meter shall be of a type obtained from the city, and shall accurately measure all water received on the premises. Installation and maintenance of such meter shall be made in accordance with plumbing regulations of the city.

Sec. 34-168. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The authorized enforcement officer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement officer may take such steps as are deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. 
(1)  Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement officer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement officer for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(2)  A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement officer.

The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community and its people through the establishment of minimum regulations governing development and use. This chapter shall divide the city into use districts and establish regulations in regard to location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of structures and land. Such regulations are established to protect such use areas; to promote orderly development and redevelopment; to provide adequate light, air and convenience of access to property; to prevent congestion in the public right-of-way; to prevent overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures in regulating land, building, yards and density of population; to provide for compatibility of different land uses; to provide for administration of this chapter; to provide for amendments; to prescribe penalties for violation of such regulations; and to define powers and duties of the city staff, the board of adjustment and appeals, the planning commission, and the city council in relation to this chapter. 
(c)  Relation to comprehensive municipal plan. It is the policy of the city that the enforcement, amendment, and administration of this chapter be accomplished with due consideration of the recommendations contained in the comprehensive municipal plan as developed and amended from time to time by the planning commission and city council. The council recognizes the comprehensive municipal plan as the policy for responsibility to regulate land use and development in accordance with the policies and purpose set forth in this chapter. 
(d)  Conflicting regulations. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter are either more or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed elsewhere in this chapter or by other ordinance, rule or regulation of the city, the provision, ordinance, rule or regulation which imposes the more restrictive condition, standard, or requirement shall prevail. 
(e)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. Any question of the interpretation or application of any provision of this chapter shall initially be resolved by the zoning administrator, whose decision may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of article II, division 5 of this chapter. 
(f)  Compliance. No structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or altered and no building, structure or land, in whole or in part, shall be used for any purpose or in any manner which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or county, state or federal law. 
(g)  Unlawful use or occupancy. Except as provided in this chapter, no building, structure or premises that does not conform to the requirements of this chapter shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building permit shall be granted. 
(h)  Uses not specifically provided for. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this chapter, the following shall apply to a use not provided for within a zoning district: 
(1)  Whenever in any zoning district a use is neither specifically permitted nor denied, the use shall be considered prohibited. 
(2)  The city council or the planning commission, on their own initiative or upon request, may utilize city staff to conduct a study to determine if a particular use not addressed in this chapter is acceptable, and, if acceptable, what zoning district would be most appropriate for such a use and the appropriate conditions and standards relating to development of such a use. 
(3)  The city council, planning commission or affected property owner, upon receipt of the staff's study, may, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to this chapter to provide for the particular use under consideration. A decision by the planning commission or city council that the proposed use is not compatible for development within the city shall be accompanied by findings in support of such decision. 
(i)  Statutory authority. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the Municipal Planning Act, Minn. Stats. §§ 462.351-462.364.

(1)  Whenever an application for any building permit is denied pursuant to this section, the applicant may appeal from such denial to the council. The council shall hold a public hearing on such appeal at any regular or special meeting of the council, notice of which hearing shall be made in the same manner as set forth in subsection (f) of this section in connection with public hearings on the official map. 
(2)  The council may grant such building permit upon evidence presented to it as follows: 
a.  That the entire tract owned by the appellant, by a denial of his use of that portion thereof for public purposes pursuant to the official map, cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such building permit is granted; and 
b.  That, balancing the interest of the city in the preservation of the comprehensive plan established by the official map against the interest of the owner of the property in his proposed use thereof, the granting of such building permit is required by the considerations of justice and equity, or the acquisition of such property pursuant to the comprehensive plan shall be commenced forthwith. 
(3)  If the appellant prevails and his application for a building permit is granted, its issuance shall not impair the full force, intent and effectiveness of the official map. 
(4)  If the council denies the issuance of such permit, the political body involved shall within six months from the date of such denial by the council institute proceedings in eminent domain or otherwise to acquire the land or interest therein set aside for public use upon the official map and, if no such proceedings are commenced within such time, the officer responsible for issuing building permits shall issue the permit if the application therefor otherwise conforms to all other pertinent ordinances. The building official shall specify the exact location, ground area, type of construction, and other details necessary for the construction of the building for which the permit is granted, all within the provisions of the various statutes and ordinances pertaining thereto. 
(j)  Conflicts with subdivision regulations. If any provisions of this section shall be in conflict with chapter 30, pertaining to subdivision regulations, the provisions of chapter 30 shall prevail.

Sec. 36-6. - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Generally. This chapter establishes separate and distinct districts, each of which is appropriate for certain specified uses and conditions. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of existing structures, uses and lots that do not conform to the requirements of the district in which they are located and to specify the requirements, circumstances and conditions under which the nonconforming structure, use or lot may be continued. In furtherance of the goals and purpose of this chapter, it is also the intent of this section that all nonconforming uses shall eventually be eliminated or made to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (1), a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, moved, or extended to occupy a greater area of land, but may continue at the size and intensity and in the manner of operation existing upon the date of its nonconformity. 
a.  A nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended to occupy a greater area of land if any such enlargement or extension is required by the laws, rules, or ordinances of the county, the state, or the United States of America, or is necessary in order to comply with a written recommendation directed specifically to that use by any such governmental authority or an enforcement agency thereof having the authority to regulate the subject matter of the written recommendation, and if any such requirement or written recommendation relates to the health, safety and/or welfare of the general public. Allowed enlargements or extensions pursuant to this subsection a include, but are not limited to, those done to comply with the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
b.  A nonconforming use allowed to enlarge or extend pursuant to subsection (b)(1)a of this section may also enlarge or extend to regain any lost capacity to function in the manner the use is conducted, which capacity was lost as the result of compliance with any such law, rule, ordinance or written recommendation of any such governmental authority. However, such recaptured capacity shall not exceed the area, size, height, or intensity of use of the original such capacity lost as a result of such compliance. 
c.  A nonconforming use may be reconfigured if, in the discretion of the city, such reconfiguration would lessen the nonconformity, abate nuisances, and protect the public health, safety and welfare. If a use is reconfigured, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city, drafted by the city attorney, stating, among other things, the purpose of the reconfiguration and that the nonconforming use will remain a legal nonconforming use. 
(2)  A nonconforming use may be continued through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not expansion except as set forth in subsection (b)(1) above. When any nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(3)  A nonconforming use may be changed to lessen the nonconformity of that use. Thereafter the use may not be so altered as to increase the nonconformity. 
(4)  A nonconforming use shall not be re-established if discontinued for a continuous one-year period, but shall remain in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, as amended. 
(5)  Any nonconforming use for which a license, permit or other evidence of city approval was lawfully issued prior to the nonconformity may be conducted in accordance with the terms of the city's mode of approval, provided that the use is started within 60 days of such date and has not been abandoned for a period of more than 120 days. Such use shall thereafter be a legally nonconforming use. 
(c)  Nonconforming lots. 
(1)  A vacant nonconforming lot may be allowed as a buildable lot provided that all the following conditions are met: 
a.  The lot is of record; 
b.  No owner of any abutting lot has any potential ownership interest in the nonconforming lot through any relationship of blood, marriage or business with any owner of the nonconforming lot; 
c.  The lot was, within one year of the latest application for a building permit, previously occupied by a principal or accessory structure actually used for the same purpose or activity or in the same manner as the structure for which the permit is sought; or the proposed structure will meet all setback requirements which currently apply to the lot; and 
d.  All other applicable requirements of this chapter are met. 
(2)  Nonconforming lots containing a principal structure may add a permitted accessory structure provided that the accessory structure will meet all minimum setback requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Additions to principal or accessory structures located on nonconforming lots may be permitted provided that any such addition will meet all minimum setback requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (d)(9) below, nonconforming principal structures shall not be expanded, enlarged or altered in a way which increases their nonconformity, but may be expanded, enlarged or altered, if the expansion, enlargement or alteration fully conforms to existing dimension requirements of the zoning and other city ordinances and regulations. Nonconforming accessory structures which are totally within a required yard setback area shall not be enlarged or expanded in any way. Notwithstanding, a nonconforming structure may be reconfigured if, in the discretion of the city, such reconfiguration would lessen the nonconformity, abate nuisances, and protect the public health, safety and welfare. If a nonconforming structure is reconfigured, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city, drafted by the city attorney, stating, among other things, the purpose of the reconfiguration and that the nonconforming structure will remain a legal nonconforming structure. 
(2)  If any nonconforming structure has deteriorated or is damaged by fire or other peril to the extent of 50 percent or more of its market value as determined by the city assessor and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged, any subsequent rebuilding or replacing of the structure shall conform to the terms of this chapter. Any building which is damaged to an extent of less than 50 percent of its value may be restored to its former extent if it is reconstructed within 12 months after the date of such damage. Estimates of the extent of damage shall be made by the building official. 
(3)  If a nonconforming structure is moved for any distance whatsoever, it shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved, except as stated in subsection (d)(1) above. 
(4)  Normal repairs and maintenance necessary to keep a nonconforming structure in sound condition shall be permitted. 
(5)  Replacement, restoration and improvement to a nonconforming structure shall be permitted. 
(6)  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when the structure is declared unsafe by the building official, provided that a building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is declared unsafe. 
(7)  Any nonconforming structure for which a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the nonconformity may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided that construction is started within 60 days of such date, is not abandoned for a period of more than 120 days, and continues to completion within two years. Such structure and use shall thereafter be a legally nonconforming structure and use. 
(8)  The city may impose reasonable condition upon a building permit that is applied for within 180 days after a structure is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value or is declared unsafe in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property. 
(9)  Expansion permits. The community development director (hereinafter CD director) may allow the expansion, enlargement or alteration of a nonconforming structure by issuance of a nonconforming structure expansion permit under the following conditions: 
a.  The applicant has filed an application which includes the following: 
1.  A plat map of the property showing all property boundaries and current improvements on the lot. 
2.  A site plan showing the proposed expansion of the nonconforming structure, including all dimensions of the existing structure, proposed expansion and setbacks from adjoining properties. 
3.  The fee required by chapter 16 of the City Code. 
4.  Such other information as the CD director may require. 
b.  The proposed expansion, enlargement or alteration of the nonconforming structure will not occupy a space that is beyond the current nonconforming structure's setback and will otherwise be compliant with all zoning and other city ordinances and regulations. For example, if the current setback for the nonconforming structure is 20 feet and 25 feet is required, an expansion permit could be issued for an expansion that kept within the 20-foot current setback and did not violate any other dimensional requirements (i.e., a second floor addition that met city height requirements). 
c.  The proposed expansion, enlargement or alteration is a reasonable use of the property, considering such things as: 
1.  Functional and aesthetic justifications for the expansion; 
2.  Adequacy of off-street parking for the expansion; 
3.  Absence of off-site impacts from such things as traffic, noise, dust, odors light and parking; and 
4.  Improvement in the appearance and stability of the property and the neighborhood. 
d.  The circumstances justifying the expansion, enlargement or alteration are unique to the property and are not caused by the landowner, are not solely for the landowner's convenience and are not solely based on economic considerations. 
e.  The expansion, enlargement or alteration will not adversely affect or alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 
f.  If a nonconforming structure expansion permit is granted, it shall be accompanied by written findings by the CD director with respect to the criteria set forth above and shall be perpetual and run with the land. The CD director may impose such terms and conditions on the permit as he deems necessary to assure that the permit meets the purpose of this section. The permit is limited to the specific project for which application is made, and shall be null and void if a building permit is not obtained and construction started within one year of permit issuance. 
g.  The CD director shall cause written notice be mailed to the properties immediately adjacent to the property that is subject of the application at least 21 days before the CD director makes a decision on the application indicating that an application is pending and that written comments may be submitted within the notice period. 
h.  An appeal may be taken from the CD director's decision in accordance with section 1-14 of the City Code for any person aggrieved within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 462.361. 
(e)  Nonconforming site improvements. 
(1)  Site improvements are those works or facilities required by this chapter for the use of the site or placed on the property at the option of the use occupying the land. Such improvements might include, by way of example, parking lots, landscaping, accessory buildings, trash enclosures, and screening. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this subsection, nonconforming site improvements may continue to serve a principal use so long as no certificate of occupancy is required for the property pursuant to article II, division 6 of this chapter. 
(3)  A certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion of a multiple-occupancy building without bringing the existing site improvements for the entire building into compliance with this chapter so long as any nonconformity is not increased. If a multiple-occupancy building becomes completely vacant, its site improvements must be brought into compliance with this chapter prior to any future occupancy. This subsection shall not imply the loss of any vested rights expressed in this chapter with regard to nonconforming structures. 
(4)  Upon any change in occupancy, nonconforming paved parking areas may continue to be utilized without improvement if the number of parking places supplied remains adequate pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this chapter, and the paved surface has not, in the city's judgment, deteriorated so as to be economically beyond repair. If the parking surface cannot be economically repaired for the new occupancy, then the parking lot surface must be replaced or otherwise brought into compliance with this chapter. Unpaved parking areas, when required, must be brought into compliance with this chapter prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy required pursuant to article II, division 6 of this chapter because of a change of use. 
(5)  When expansion of an existing site improvement is required, the newly constructed portion of the site improvement shall meet all of the requirements of this chapter.

Cross reference- Utilities, ch. 34. 
Sec. 36-13. - Essential services. 
(a)  Facilities installed in right-of-way. All underground telephone lines, pipelines for local distribution, underground electric transmission lines, and overhead electric transmission lines, and substations less than 33 kv, when installed in any public right-of-way in any zoning district, shall require a special permit approved by the city engineer. 
(b)  Facilities not installed in right-of-way. All underground telephone lines, pipelines for local distribution, underground electric transmission lines, and overhead electric transmission lines less than 33 kv which are intended to serve more than one parcel and are proposed to be installed at locations other than in public rights-of-way shall require a special permit issued by the city after approval by the engineering department of the city. Approval by the engineering department shall be based upon the information furnished in the following procedural requirements: 
(1)  Prior to the installation of any of such essential services, the owner of such service shall file with the zoning administrator all maps and other pertinent information as deemed necessary for the city engineering department to review the proposed project. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall transmit the map and accompanying information to the city engineering department for its review and approval regarding the project's relationship to the comprehensive plan and/or ordinances and parts thereof.

A part of this review shall be a written report from the city planner, the city engineer and the parks and recreation director. 
(3)  The planning commission shall hold the necessary public hearings as prescribed by this chapter for conditional use. 
(4)  The planning commission shall report in writing to the city council its findings as to compliance of the proposed project with the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  In considering the application for the placement of essential services as regulated by this subsection, the city council shall consider the advice and recommendations of the planning commission and the effect of the proposed project upon the health, safety and general welfare of the city, existing and anticipated, and the effect of the proposed project upon the comprehensive plan. 
(d)  Commercial wireless telecommunications antennas and towers. Commercial wireless telecommunications antennas and towers shall be permitted in all zoning districts in conformance with the following requirements: 
(1)  No commercial antenna or tower of any kind shall hereafter be erected, constructed, or placed, or reerected, reconstructed or replaced, anywhere within the city without first making an application for and obtaining from the city a permit therefor and providing to the city proof of the manufacturing engineer's seal for the antenna or tower. Application for such a permit shall be made to the building department in the same manner as a building permit under this Code. If the applicant is proposing a location other than an existing structure, building or tower, the applicant must submit information and documentation with the application to sufficiently demonstrate the existence of one of the conditions set forth in subsection (2)a, (2)b, (2)c and/or (2)d of this subsection. All applications shall include a letter of intent committing the tower owner and his successors to allow the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use. Private antennas and towers shall be governed by chapter 8, article VIII. 
(2)  In all areas of the city, antennas and towers shall be located on existing structures, buildings or towers within a one-mile radius of the proposed location unless the proposed antenna or tower cannot be accommodated on an existing structure, building or tower due to one or more of the following reasons: 
a.  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved structure, building or tower, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved structure, building or tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost. 
b.  The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the structure, building or tower as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
c.  An existing or approved structure, building or tower within the one-mile radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer. 
d.  Other unforeseen reasons make it infeasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved structure, building or tower. 
(3)  If the proposed antenna or tower cannot be accommodated on an existing structure, building or tower for the reasons set forth in subsection (d)(2) of this section, antennas and towers may be located on available public or institutional land. Antennas placed on institutional land in residential districts shall be incorporated into the principal structure, when available, rather than placed on a tower separate from the principal building. On public property, antennas shall be mounted on structures, when available, that serve other purposes such as light standards or emergency siren poles. If structures are not available or are unable to accommodate proposed antennas or towers, a tower separate from the principal structure may be constructed. If public or institutional land is not available, antennas and towers may be located on private property, with the exception of residential districts. 
(4)  Antenna towers shall be limited to 150 feet in height. Newly constructed towers shall be set back from lot lines in the following manner. In or adjacent to residential districts, towers 50 feet in height or lower shall be set back one foot from the nearest non-public lot line for every foot of tower height. Towers higher than 50 feet but no higher than 100 feet shall be set back 50 feet plus two feet for each foot of tower height over 50 feet from the nearest non-public lot line. Towers higher than 100 feet shall be set back 150 feet plus four feet for every foot of tower height over 100 feet from the nearest non-public lot line. For all other zoning districts, the tower shall be set back one foot for every one foot of height unless adjacent to residential zoning, which would require the setbacks identified above or if adjacent to public land which would not require a setback. A public lot line means a lot line shared with public land, including, but not limited to, rights-of-way, parks, school district boundaries, etc. Towers or antennas installed in public rights-of-way may be no higher than 50 feet. 
(5)  Towers shall be designed to blend in with their surroundings through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment. Antenna attachments to towers shall be as inconspicuous as possible. No tower shall have constructed thereon or attached thereto, in any way, any platform, catwalk, crow's nest or like structure. 
(6)  Ground equipment shall be screened from all property lines. Screening shall be accomplished through landscaping and shall be of an evergreen type and tall enough to limit the view of the equipment. Any fencing shall be similarly screened. Any buildings shall meet the materials standards of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(7)  Any proposed tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights. 
(8)  Any abandoned or unused towers shall be removed within 12 months of cessation of operations at the site. If a tower is not removed within 12 months of the cessation of operations at the site, the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the city and the costs of removal assessed against the property. 
(9)  Antennas and towers which do not conform to or comply with this section are subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Towers may continue in use for the purpose now used and as now existing but may not be replaced or structurally altered without complying in all respects with this section. 
b.  If such towers are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason or cause whatsoever, the tower may be repaired and restored to its former use, location, and physical dimensions upon obtaining a building permit therefor, but without otherwise complying with this section; provided, however, that if the cost of repairing the tower to the former use, physical dimensions, and location would be ten percent or more of the cost of a new tower of like kind and quality, then the tower may not be repaired or restored except in full compliance with this section. 
(10)  Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(11)  All towers may be inspected at least once each year by an official of the building and inspection division to determine compliance with original construction standards.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Secs. 36-41-36-60. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 36-61. - Purpose. 
(a)  A planned unit development (PUD) is intended to allow variation from the strict literal provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, requirements relating to setbacks, height, floor area, floor area ratio, lot area, width, depth, and yards. If a proposed development is approved by the city as a PUD as provided in this section, then the dimensions of the PUD as approved shall be deemed to be in compliance with all of the dimensional requirements of this chapter, including setbacks, height, floor area, floor area ratio, lot area, lot width, lot depth and yards. 
(b)  A PUD may be voluntary or required (as in the case of shopping centers). A PUD may be residential, business, industrial or mixed use in nature. A residential PUD may allow all uses permitted in the R-1 through R-5 zoning districts and must be developed pursuant to a conditional use permit within residentially zoned property unless mixed uses are a part of the PUD. A business PUD may allow all uses permitted in the B zoning district and must be developed pursuant to a conditional use permit within property zoned for business uses unless mixed uses are a part of the PUD. An industrial PUD may allow all uses permitted in the I zoning district and must be developed pursuant to a conditional use permit within property zoned for industrial uses. A PUD in a district zoned PUD shall allow mixed uses, and PUDs in which mixed uses are permitted shall be zoned PUD. 
(c)  A PUD is intended to result in a development in which the living or working environment is better than could otherwise have been achieved through strict enforcement of the dimensional requirements of other applicable sections of this chapter. A PUD will not be permitted unless the landowner demonstrates that the development would be consistent with the spirit and intent of the city's comprehensive plan, that the development would be consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter, and that the development would tend to accomplish the following objectives for PUDs: 
(1)  For any PUD with a residential component guided low-medium density residential, over ten acres in size and outside the gravel mining area, or guided medium density residential or high density residential, regardless of size, and outside of the gravel mining area, shall be assessed against the project point system which ensures innovations within a single development having a greater variety in type, design, and siting of dwellings to meet the growing demands for housing at various economic levels and the growing demands for rental units as well as owner-occupied units; 
(2)  Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects; 
(3)  The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography and geographic features, and the protection of natural vegetation and water features; 
(4)  An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby lowering housing costs and public investments; 
(5)  A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; and 
(6)  A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of the zoning and subdivision regulations of the city. 
(d)  A PUD is intended to allow variation from the strict literal provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, requirements relating to setbacks, height, floor area, floor area ratio, lot area, width, depth, and yards. 
(Code 1984, § 375:114(1); Ord. No. 04-16, § 1, 7-19-2004; Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 1-5-2015) 
Sec. 36-62. - General standards. 
(a)  Scope. The following developments and redevelopments shall be subject to this division: (i) all developments and redevelopments within the gravel mining area; and (ii) all developments and redevelopments with a residential component not within the gravel mining area, except existing residential developments, and new residential developments created by subsection 30-8(b) and section 30-14. 
(b)  Inapplicability of variance provisions. The provisions of article II, division 5 of this chapter relating to variances shall not apply to this section. 
(c)  Subdivision. All properties within the scope of subsection 36-62(a) shall be platted pursuant to chapter 30. An application for subdivision, under chapter 30, of property within the scope of subsection 36-62(a) shall be considered premature and shall not be considered or processed until PUD approval has been granted. 
(d)  Ownership. An application for PUD approval must be filed by the landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in the project. The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved plan shall be binding on all owners. 
(e)  Open space. A PUD is intended to preserve and concentrate open space. This can be done by either creating common open areas or by reserving specific amounts of open space on each lot. The open space requirements of this section shall be in addition to any public park dedication required by chapter 30. 
(1)  Residential PUDs. Residential developments shall result in a maximum of 40 percent coverage of the land outside public rights-of-way with impermeable surfaces. 
(2)  Business PUDs. Business developments shall result in a maximum of 75 percent coverage of the land outside public rights-of-way with impermeable surfaces. 
(3)  Industrial PUDs. Industrial developments shall result in a maximum of 75 percent coverage of the land outside public rights-of-way with impermeable surfaces. 
(4)  Mixed use PUDs. Mixed use developments shall result in a variable amount of land covered with impermeable surfaces. The actual amount shall be determined by calculating the amount of land occupied by the different uses and then applying the standards set forth in subsections (1) through (3) of this subsection. 
(f)  Operating and maintenance requirements for common open space and facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are provided within the PUD, the PUD plan shall contain provisions to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common open space and service facilities within a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following, as approved by the city council: 
(1)  The public, by dedication, where community-wide use is anticipated and the city council agrees to accept the dedication. 
(2)  Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated. 
(3)  A property owners' association, provided all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  Prior to the use or occupancy or sale or the execution of contracts for sale of an individual building unit, parcel, tract, townhouse, apartment or common area, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an equivalent document or a document such as specified by Minn. Stats. § 515A.2-105 and a set of floor plans such as specified by such statute shall be filed with the city, such filing with the city to be made prior to the filings of the declaration or document or floor plans with the recording officers of the county. 
b.  The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or equivalent document shall specify that deeds, leases or documents of conveyance affecting buildings, units, parcels, tracts, townhouses, or apartments shall subject the properties to the terms of the declaration. 
c.  The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall provide that an owners' association or corporation shall be formed and that all owners shall be members of the association or corporation, which shall maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall assess individual property owners proportionate shares of joint or common costs. This declaration shall be subject to the review and approval of the city attorney. The intent of this requirement is to protect the property values of the individual owner through establishing private control. 
d.  The declaration shall additionally, among other things, provide that, if the association or corporation fails to maintain properties in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the city or fails to pay taxes or assessments on properties as they become due and if the city incurs any expenses in enforcing its rules and regulations, which expenses are not immediately reimbursed by the association or corporation, then the city shall have the right to assess each property its pro rata share of such expenses. Such assessments, together with interest thereon and costs of collection, shall be a lien on each property against which each such assessment is made. 
e.  Membership must be mandatory for each owner and any successive buyer. 
f.  The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a given period of years. 
g.  The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes, and the maintenance of the open space facilities to be deeded to it. 
h.  A property owner must pay his pro rata share of the cost of the association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association which meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with state statutes. 
i.  The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs. 
j.  The bylaws and rules of the association and all covenants and restrictions to be recorded must be approved by the city council prior to the approval of the development stage PUD plan. 
(g)  Staging of public and common open space. When a PUD provides for common or public open space, the total area of common or public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD. 
(h)  Density. The maximum residential density of a PUD may not exceed the maximum residential density permitted by the comprehensive plan, unless the PUD qualifies for additional density as follows, which shall be cumulative in effect: 
(1)  In areas designated on the land use plan as mixed low/medium density residential: 
a.  Density for the PUD as a whole may be 25 percent greater than would otherwise be permitted under the comprehensive plan if: 
1.  At least 30 percent, but no more than 50 percent of all dwelling units in the PUD, are affordable to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median as determined by the metropolitan council; and 
2.  Of the units described in subsection (h)(1)a.1 above, at least 20 percent but no more than 50 percent of all dwelling units, and in no case more than 50 units, are affordable to families with incomes at or below 50 percent of the area median as determined by the metropolitan council. 
b.  Density for the PUD as a whole may be 12.5 percent greater than would otherwise be permitted under the comprehensive plan if at least 20 percent of all dwelling units shall be occupied by renters. 
(2)  In areas designated on the land use plan as mixed medium density residential: 
a.  Density for the PUD as a whole may be 6-2/3 percent greater than would otherwise be permitted under the comprehensive plan if: 
1.  At least 30 percent but no more than 50 percent of all dwelling units in the PUD, are affordable to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median as determined by the metropolitan council; and 
2.  Of the units described in subsection (h)(1)a.1 above, at least 30 percent but no more than 50 percent of all dwelling units, and in no case more than 50 units, are affordable to families with incomes at or below 50 percent of the area median as determined by the metropolitan council. 
b.  Density for the PUD as a whole may be 3-1/3 percent greater than would otherwise be permitted under the comprehensive plan if at least 20 percent of all dwelling units shall be occupied by renters. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the density of the PUD as a whole, the density standards as expressed in section 36-8 shall apply to each different residential use included within the PUD. 
(4)  In residential PUDs that encompass both mixed low/medium density and mixed medium density land use designations, the standards applicable to each density designation shall apply in the area of the PUD containing that designation. 
(5)  Density bonuses shall not be granted on lands governed by the gravel mining area special area plan. 
(i)  Utilities to be installed underground. In any PUD, all utilities, including telephone, electricity, gas and telecable, shall be installed underground. 
(j)  Water and sewer connections. 
(1)  Water connections. Where more than one property is served from the same service line, a shut-off valve must be located in such a way that each unit's service may be shut off by the city, in addition to the normally supplied shut-off at the street. 
(2)  Sewer connections. Where more than one unit is served by a sanitary sewer lateral which exceeds 300 feet in length, provision must be made for a manhole to allow adequate cleaning and maintenance of the lateral. All maintenance and cleaning shall be the responsibility of the property owners' association or owner. 
(k)  Roadways. All streets which give access to single-family dwellings shall be public and shall conform to the design standards of the subdivision regulations contained in chapter 30 or such alternative standard accepted by the city council which accomplishes the same quality of public service. No private drive may serve more than four single-family units, except that up to 12 units in no more than two buildings of the housing units known as eight-plexes or twelve-plexes may be accessed by a private drive. 
(l)  Landscaping. In any PUD, landscaping shall be provided in accordance with the standards listed in article VIII of this chapter. 
(m)  Urban development and availability of public services. All development will be carefully phased so as to ensure that all developable land will be able to develop at such time as services and facilities are available. 
(1)  Lands which have the necessary available municipal facilities and services will be granted approval in accordance with existing ordinances and development techniques. 
(2)  Lands which lack the available facilities and services will be granted approval for development at such times as the facilities and services have been made available by the continuing public improvement program. 
(3)  No PUD will be permitted in areas not having city water and sanitary sewer available. 
(n)  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all non-single-family detached portions of PUDs. In single-family detached areas, the standards of the R-2 zone shall apply: 
(1)  The front and side yard restrictions at the periphery of the planned unit development site, at a minimum, shall be the same as imposed in the zoning districts which permit the uses within the development. 
(2)  Buildings shall be located at least 15 feet from any street right-of-way along those roadways which are part of the internal street pattern. Private garages shall be 25 feet from any street right-of-way. 
(3)  No building within the project shall be nearer to another building than one-half the sum of the building heights of the two buildings.

(a)  Concept plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The concept plan provides an opportunity for the applicant to submit a plan to the city showing his basic intent and the general nature of the entire development without incurring substantial cost. The concept plan serves as the basis for the public hearing so that the proposal may be publicly considered at an early stage. The following elements of the proposed general concept plan represent the immediately significant elements which the city shall review and for which a decision shall be rendered: 
a.  Overall maximum PUD density. 
b.  General location of major streets and pedestrian ways. 
c.  General location and extent of public and common open space. 
d.  General location of residential and nonresidential land uses with approximate type and intensities of development. 
e.  Other special criteria for development. 
(2)  Schedule. 
a.  The developer shall meet with the director of community development and/or city staff to discuss the proposed development. 
b.  The developer shall submit the necessary data as required in section 36-63(1) and subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
c.  After verification by the staff that the required plan and supporting data are adequate, the zoning administrator shall set a public hearing for a regular meeting of the planning commission. 
1.  The planning commission shall conduct the hearing, and report its findings and make recommendations to the city council. 
2.  Notice of the hearing shall consist of the property identification number and street address or common description, a description of the request, and a map detailing the property location, and shall be published in the official newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing. 
3.  Written notification of the hearing shall also be mailed at least ten days prior to all owners of land within 500 feet of the boundary of the property in question. 
4.  Failure of a property owner to receive the notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this chapter. 
d.  A technical staff report shall be prepared on the proposed development, and distributed to the planning commission and the applicant prior to the meeting. 
e.  The applicant or a representative thereof shall appear before the planning commission in order to answer questions concerning the proposed development. The planning commission and city staff shall have the authority to request additional information from the applicant concerning operational factors or to retain expert testimony with the consent and at the expense of the applicant concerning operational factors, such information to be declared necessary to establish performance conditions in relation to all pertinent sections of this chapter. 
f.  The planning commission shall submit its written report and recommendations to the council and applicant. 
1.  Such report shall contain the findings of the planning commission with respect to the compliance of the general concept plan with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and ordinances. 
2.  If the planning commission shall find the concept plan, or any amended plan agreed to by the petitioner, to be in all other respects complete and in compliance with this chapter and other applicable federal, state and local codes and ordinances, it shall recommend approval of the plan. Otherwise, it shall recommend denial of approval. 
3.  If the planning commission fails to act within the time specified in this section, it shall be deemed to have recommended the plan for approval. 
g.  If time permits, the council may resubmit the plan to the planning commission for further consideration of specified items. City council approval shall require a positive vote by majority vote of the council membership. 
(3)  Optional submission of development stage plan. In cases of single-stage PUDs, or where the applicant wishes to begin the first stage of a multiple-stage PUD immediately, the applicant may, at his option, submit an application for development stage plan approval for the proposed PUD simultaneously with the submission of the application for concept plan approval. In such case, the applicant shall comply with all provisions of this chapter applicable to submission of the development stage plan. The planning commission and council shall consider such applications simultaneously and shall grant or deny development stage plan approval in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. 
(4)  Effect of concept plan approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing development stage plans or shall fail to proceed with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any condition of this chapter or of any approval granted pursuant to it, a concept plan which has been approved or PUD agreement signed by the applicant shall not, by any action of the city taken without the consent of the applicant, be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired while the application for approval of development stage and final plans is pending. 
(5)  Limitation on concept plan approval. Unless a development stage plan covering at least 50,000 square feet of building area in a nonresidential PUD has been filed within one year from the date the council grants concept plan approval, or, in a residential PUD, a development stage plan for 20 percent of the entire concept stage plan property is filed within one year from the date the council grants concept plan approval and, for the remaining concept stage plan property, a development stage plan for 20 percent of the entire concept stage plan property is filed within every two years after the first development stage plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file development stage plans and to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and of an approved concept plan, the approval, subject to the following, shall expire. 
a.  At any time within 30 days before such deadline, the applicant may file with the zoning administrator a written request that the deadline be extended one year beyond the date the extension is granted.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Nov. 7, 2016, repealed the former div. 4, §§ 36-651-36-674, and enacted a new div. 4 as set out herein. The former div. 4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Code 1984, §§ 375:105(1)-(21); and Ord. No. 04-17, § 2, adopted Aug. 2, 2004. 

Sec. 36-651. - Purpose. 
(a)  This division regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 
(b)  National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This division is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 - 78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(c)  This division is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-652. - General provisions; definitions. 
(a)  How to use this division. This division adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the city and includes three floodplain districts: floodway, flood fringe, and general floodplain. 
(1)  Where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in sections 36-654 and 36-655 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 
(2)  Locations are considered to fall within the general floodplain district where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps. Within the general floodplain district, the floodway district standards in section 36-654 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in section 36-656. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the flood fringe district standards in section 36-655 may apply outside the floodway. 
(b)  Lands to which division applies. This division applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts. 
(1)  The floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this division. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
(c)  Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this division. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file with the city engineering department.

27053C0183F 
27053C0184F 
(d)  Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(e)  Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map. 
(1)  Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The zoning administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program Map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 
(2)  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this division to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or other private agreements. However, where this division imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division prevail. All other divisions inconsistent with this division are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. This division does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This division does not create liability on the part of the city or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this division or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(h)  Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this division must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to give this division it's most reasonable application. 
(1)  Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
(2)  Base flood elevation means the elevation of the "regional flood." The term "base flood elevation" is used in the flood insurance survey. 
(3)  Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
(4)  Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 
a.  Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning division exist. 
b.  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
(5)  Critical facilities means facilities necessary to a community's public health and safety, those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, and those that house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, day care facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater treatment facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and waste handling and storage facilities. 
(6)  Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
(7)  Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
(8)  Farm fence means a fence as defined by Minn. Stats. § 344.02, subd. 1(a)-(d). An open-type fence of posts and wire is not considered to be a structure under this division. Fences that have the potential to obstruct flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are regulated as structures under this division. 
(9)  Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
(10)  Flood frequency means the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
(11)  Flood fringe means the portion of the special flood hazard area (one percent annual chance flood) located outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota. 
(12)  Flood-prone area means any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "Flood" ). 
(13)  Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.

(16)  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 60.3. 
(17)  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
(18)  New construction means structures, including additions and improvements, and placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of this division. 
(19)  Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
(20)  One hundred year floodplain means lands inundated by the "regional flood" (see definition). 
(21)  Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
(22)  Reach means a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
(23)  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. For the purposes of this division, the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term "travel trailer/travel vehicle." 
(24)  Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the one percent chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 
(25)  Regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) means an elevation not less than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(26)  Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(27)  Special flood hazard area is a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with "one hundred year floodplain." 
(28)  Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit's expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(29)  Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in subsection 36-659(b)(2) of this division and other similar items. 
(30)  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(31)  Substantial improvement, within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." For the purpose of this division, "historic structure" is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. 
(i)  Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into subsection (c) above, may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this division. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this division, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this division immediately upon the date of annexation. 
(j)  Detachments. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into subsection (c) above, will include floodplain areas that lie inside the corporate boundaries of municipalities at the time of adoption of this division. If any of these floodplain land areas are detached from a municipality and come under the jurisdiction of the city after the date of adoption of this division, the newly detached floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this division immediately upon the date of detachment.

f.  As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the state building code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
1.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and 
2.  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(4)  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 103G.245. 
(5)  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an increase to the one percent chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
(6)  Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-655. - Flood fringe district (FLDF). 
(a)  Permitted uses: Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in subsection (b) below. If no pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a permitted use provided it does not constitute a public nuisance. 
(b)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses: 
(1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure. 
(2)  Accessory structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of subsection (b)(1) above, structures accessory to the uses identified in subsection (a) of this section may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the state building code, provided that: 
a.  The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and storage. 
b.  All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be: (i) adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and (iii) must have all service utilities be water-tight or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
c.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
1.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and 
2.  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(3)  The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, or if allowed as a conditional use under subsections (b)(4)-(b)(11) below. 
(4)  The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(5)  All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters. 
(6)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. 
(7)  All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. 
(8)  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the city engineer. 
(9)  Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
(10)  Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration must be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location. 
(11)  Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of section 36-659 of this division. 
(c)  Conditional uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the procedures in subsection 36-660(d) of this division: 
(1)  Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(3)  The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(d)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses: 
(1)  The standards listed in subsections (b)(4) through (b)(10) of this section apply to all conditional uses. 
(2)  Basements, as defined by subsection 36-652(h)(3) of this division, are subject to the following: 
a.  Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (d)(3) of this section. 
(3)  All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the state building code, which requires making the structure water-tight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. 
(4)  The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan. 
a.  The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on-site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (one percent chance) flood event. 
b.  The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city engineer. 
c.  The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(e)  Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-656. - General floodplain district (GF). 
(a)  Permitted uses: 
(1)  The uses listed in subsection 36-654(a) of this division, floodway district permitted uses, are permitted uses. 
(2)  All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in subsection (b) below. Section 36-654 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the floodway district. Section 36-655 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the flood fringe district. 
(b)  Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations: 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 
(2)  If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the floodway or flood fringe district. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in subsection (b)(3) below. 
(3)  The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable: 
a.  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
b.  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
c.  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(4)  The city engineer will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The zoning administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the department of natural resources. Based on this assessment, the city engineer may approve or deny the application. 
(5)  Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the zoning administrator must process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 36-654 and 36-655 of this division. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-657. - Land development standards. 
(a)  In general. Recognizing that flood-prone areas may exist outside of the designated floodplain districts, the requirements of this section apply to all land within the city. 
(b)  Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this division. 
(1)  All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(2)  All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (one percent chance) flood has been approved by the city engineer. The plan must be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation. 
(3)  For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents. 
(4)  In the general floodplain district, applicants must provide the information required in subsection 36-656(b) of this division to determine the regional flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site. 
(5)  If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that: 
a.  All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area; 
b.  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 
c.  Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard. 
(c)  Building sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of manufactured homes) must be: 
(1)  Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(3)  Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and 
(4)  Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

Sec. 36-658. - Public utilities, railroads, roads and bridges. 
(a)  Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain must be floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(b)  Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads and bridges to be located within the floodplain must comply with sections 36-654 and 36-655 of this division. These transportation facilities must be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation where failure or interruption of these facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety. 
(c)  On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems. Where public utilities are not provided: 1) on-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and are subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules Chapter 4725.4350, as amended; and 2) new or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, they must not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding, and are subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7080.2270, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-659. - Manufactured homes, manufactured home parks and recreational vehicles. 
(a)  Manufactured homes. New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home parks are prohibited in any floodplain district. For existing manufactured home parks or lots of record, the following requirements apply: 
(1)  Placement or replacement of manufactured home units is prohibited in the floodway district. 
(2)  If allowed in the flood fringe district, placement or replacement of manufactured home units is subject to the requirements of section 36-655 of this division and the following standards: 
a.  New and replacement manufactured homes must be elevated in compliance with section 36-655 of this division and must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  New or replacement manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parks must meet the vehicular access requirements for subdivisions in subsection 36-657(b)(2). 
(b)  Recreational vehicles. New recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and expansions to existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are prohibited in any floodplain district. Placement of recreational vehicles in existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds in the floodplain must meet the exemption criteria below or be treated as new structures meeting the requirements of this division. 
(1)  Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this division if they are placed in any of the following areas and meet the criteria listed in subsection (b)(2) of this section: 
a.  Individual lots or parcels of record. 
b.  Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds. 
c.  Existing condominium-type associations. 
(2)  Criteria for exempt recreational vehicles: 
a.  The vehicle must have a current license required for highway use. 
b.  The vehicle must be highway ready, meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks. 
c.  No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the vehicle. 
d.  The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning district. 
e.  Accessory structures are not permitted within the floodway district. Any accessory structure in the flood fringe district must be constructed of flood-resistant materials and be securely anchored, meeting the requirements applicable to manufactured homes in this subsection (b)(2). 
f.  An accessory structure must constitute a minimal investment 
(c)  Recreational vehicles that are exempt in subsection (b)(2) above, lose this exemption when development occurs on the site that exceeds a minimal investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will then be treated as new structures subject to the elevation and floodproofing requirements of section 36-655 of this division. No development or improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the removal of the vehicle should flooding occur. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-660. - Administration. 
(a)  Zoning administrator. A zoning administrator or other official designated by the city council must administer and enforce this division. 
(b)  Permit requirements. 
(1)  Permit required. A permit must be obtained from the city engineer prior to conducting the following activities below the regulatory flood protection elevation: 
a.  The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation or alteration of any building, structure or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in this division. 
b.  The use or change of use of a building, structure or land. 
c.  The construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, although a permit is not required for a farm fence as defined in this division. 
d.  The change or extension of a nonconforming use. 
e.  The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source. 
f.  The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within the floodplain. 
g.  Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied for. 
h.  Any other type of "development" as defined in this division. 
(2)  Application for permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the zoning administrator on forms provided by the zoning administrator. The permit application must include the following as applicable: 
a.  A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an influence on the permit. 
b.  Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel. 
c.  Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or approvals. 
d.  Other relevant information requested by the zoning administrator as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application. 
(3)  Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered or nonconforming use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the zoning administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this division. 
(4)  Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this division. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect. 
(5)  Record of first floor elevation. The zoning administrator must maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain. The zoning administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed. 
(6)  Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the zoning administrator must notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public waters pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(7)  Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base flood elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the zoning administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data. 
(c)  Variances. 
(1)  Variance applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this division will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable state statutes and article II, division 5 of this chapter. 
(2)  Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance must not allow a use that is not allowed in that district; permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(3)  Additional variance criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied to the extent allowed by Minnesota law: 
a.  Variances must not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
b.  Variances may only be issued upon: (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or divisions. 
c.  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Flood insurance notice. The zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 2) such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  General considerations. The council may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains: 
a.  The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments; 
b.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others; 
c.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; 
d.  The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
e.  The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community; 
f.  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location; 
g.  The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding; 
h.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future; 
i.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive land use plan and flood plain management program for the area; 
j.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
k.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site. 
(6)  Submittal of hearing notices to the department of natural resources (DNR). The city engineer must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days' notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(7)  Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(8)  Record-keeping. The zoning administrator must maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(d)  Conditional uses. 
(1)  Administrative review. An application for a conditional use permit under the provisions of this division will be processed and reviewed in accordance with section 36-662. 
(2)  Factors used in decision-making. In passing upon conditional use applications, all relevant factors specified in subections 36-103(a) and 36-121(b) and (c) must be considered, and those factors identified in subsection (c)(5) of this section. 
(3)  Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The city council may attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this division. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities. 
b.  Limitations on period of use, occupancy and operation. 
c.  Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions. 
d.  Requirements for construction of channel modifications, compensatory storage, dikes, levees, and other protective measures. 
e.  Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the state building code and this division. The applicant must submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area. 
(4)  Submittal of hearing notices to the department of natural resources (DNR). The city engineer must submit hearing notices for proposed conditional uses to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days' notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(5)  Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting conditional uses must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.

Sec. 36-661. - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Continuance of nonconformities. A use, structure or occupancy of land which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this division but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this division may be continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined in subsection 36-652(h)(31)b of this division, are subject to the provisions of subsections (a) (1)-(6) of this section. 
(1)  A nonconforming use, structure or occupancy must not be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way that increases its flood damage potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in subsection (a)(2) below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the floodway district is prohibited. 
(2)  Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP1 thru FP4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the state building code, except as further restricted in subsections (a)(3) and (a)(7) below. 
(3)  If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of any nonconforming structure, that shall be considered substantial improvement, and the entire structure must meet the standards of sections 36-654 or 36-655 of this division for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. 
(4)  If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must conform to this division. The assessor must notify the zoning administrator in writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a period of more than one year. 
(5)  If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in subsection 36-652(h)(30) of this division, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this division. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in sections 36-654 or 36-655 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively. 
(6)  If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss, as defined in subsection 36-652(h)(26) of this division, it must not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this division. 
(7)  Any substantial improvement, as defined in subsection 36-652(h)(31) of this division, to a nonconforming structure requires that the existing structure and any additions must meet the requirements of sections 36-654 or 36-655 of this division for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-662. - Penalties and enforcement. 
(a)  Violation constitutes a misdemeanor. Violation of the provisions of this division or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall be punished as provided in section 1-13. 
(b)  Other lawful action. Nothing in this division restricts the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the zoning administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this division and will be prosecuted accordingly. 
(c)  Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of this division will be investigated and resolved in accordance with the provisions of section 36-652. In responding to a suspected division violation, the zoning administrator and the city engineer may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it, including but not limited to, prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct division violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1(Exh. A), 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 36-663. - Amendments. 
(a)  Floodplain designation-Restrictions on removal. The floodplain designation on the official zoning map must not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of the department of natural resources (DNR) if the commissioner determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use. 
(b)  Amendments require DNR approval. All amendments to this division must be submitted to and approved by the commissioner of the department of natural resources (DNR) prior to adoption. The commissioner must approve the amendment prior to community approval. 
(c)  Map revisions require division amendments. The floodplain district regulations must be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the floodplain maps adopted in subsection 36-652(c) of this division.

DIVISION 5. - S SHORELAND DISTRICT 

Sec. 36-691. - Statutory authority; general policy. 
(a)  This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minn. Stats. ch. 103G, Minn. Regs. parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minn. Stats. ch. 462. 
(b)  The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters. The legislature of the state has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This responsibility is recognized by the city.

Sec. 36-692. - Applicability; compliance. 
(a)  The provisions of this division shall apply to the shorelands of the public water bodies as classified in section 36-694. Pursuant to Minn. Regs. parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flowage less than ten acres in size will be regulated. A body of water created by a private user where there was no previous shoreland shall be exempt from this division. 
(b)  The use of any shoreland of public waters, the size and shape of lots, the use, size, type and location of structures on lots, the installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment systems, the grading and filling of any shoreland area, the cutting of shoreland vegetation, and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations, such as, but not limited to, chapter 34, article III, and chapter 14, article IV. 
(c)  The S shoreland district shall be applied to and superimposed upon all zoning districts as contained in this chapter as existing or amended by the text of this chapter and the zoning map. The regulations and requirements imposed by the S shoreland district shall be in addition to those established for districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 
(d)  It is not intended by this division to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this division imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this division shall prevail. 
(Code 1984, § 375:108(2)) 
Sec. 36-693. - Administration. 
(a)  Permits. Pursuant to other provisions of this Code, permits may be required for the construction of structures, the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by section 36-695. A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall stipulate that an identified nonconforming sewage treatment system, as described in sections 36-695 and 36-696, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(b)  Certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be required for each activity requiring a permit as specified in subsection (a) of this section. The certificate shall specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this division. Any use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this division. 
(c)  Variances. Variances may only be granted in accordance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, article II, division 5, of this chapter. No variance may circumvent the general purposes and intent of this chapter, and conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. 
(1)  The city council shall decide requests for variances under this division in accordance with article II, division 5, of this chapter. In addition, the council shall also consider the characteristics of development on adjacent properties, and no variance shall be granted which the council determines will or has a tendency to: 
a.  Result in the placement of an artificial obstruction which will restrict the passage of stormwater and floodwater in such a manner as to increase the height of flooding, except obstructions approved by the appropriate watershed district in conjunction with sound floodplain management; 
b.  Result in incompatible land uses or which would be detrimental to the protection of surface water and groundwater supplies; 
c.  Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for the city or which will increase or cause danger to life or property; or 
d.  Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the preservation of the natural land forms, vegetation and the marshes and wetlands within the city. 
(2)  No variance shall be granted unless the applicant has submitted a shoreland impact plan as required and set forth in subsection (d) of this section. In granting any variance, the council may attach such conditions as it deems necessary to ensure compliance with the policy and intent of this chapter. 
(3)  For existing developments, the application for variance must clearly demonstrate whether public sewer or a conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property. The variance, if issued, must require connection to available public sewer as contemplated in chapter 34, article III, or, if no public sewer is available, reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system pursuant to sections 36-695(h) and 36-696(3), as well as applicable provisions of chapter 34, article III. 
(d)  Shoreland impact plan. Landowners or developers desiring to develop land or construct any dwelling or any other artificial obstruction on land located within any shoreland district within the city shall first submit a conditional use permit application as regulated by article II, division 4 of this chapter, and a plan of development, referred to in this division as a "shoreland impact plan," which shall set forth proposed provisions for sediment control, water management maintenance of landscaped features, and any additional matters intended to improve or maintain the quality of environment. In addition, the shore impact plan shall be provided as otherwise required under this division. 
(1)  Such a shore impact plan shall set forth proposed changes requested by the applicant and affirmatively disclose what, if any, change will be made in the natural condition of the earth, including loss or change of earth ground cover, destruction of trees, grade changes, and its effect, if any, upon lakes, streams, watercourses and marshes. 
(2)  The shore impact plan shall minimize tree removal, ground cover change, loss of natural vegetation, and grade changes as much as possible, and shall affirmatively provide for the relocation or replanting of as many trees as possible which are proposed to be removed. 
(3)  The shore impact plan shall show and specify, among other requirements herein: 
a.  Total diameter inches and species composition of trees at least eight DBH inches to be preserved; 
b.  Total number of diameter inches of trees at least eight DBH inches to be removed; 
c.  Limits of tree clearing, tree protection zones and fencing; and 
d.  Location of all underground utilities. 
(4)  The shore impact plan shall specifying the methods to be used to preserve all remaining trees and their root systems. 
(5)  The shore impact plan shall include such other information as the community development director deems necessary. 
(6)  The purpose of the shoreland impact plan shall be to eliminate as much as possible potential pollution, erosion and siltation. The shore impact plan shall include stormwater best management practices from the Minnesota Stormwater Manual. 
(7)  No conditional use permit shall be required for the development of permitted uses or permitted accessory uses contained within the R-A, R-1, R-2 or R-3 district provided that, where appropriate, all such uses are serviced with public sanitary sewer. 
(e)  State review requirements. No approval of any development or construction in the shoreland district can occur until any environmental review program or process required by the state environmental quality board, such as, but not limited to, the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet or environmental impact statement, is complete. 
(f)  Notification to state of public hearings. Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments, or conditional uses under this division must be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the subdivision/plat. 
(g)  Notification to state of approved amendments, plats, variances and conditional uses. A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls, must be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action. In addition, when a variance is approved after the state department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the approved variance required in this subsection shall also include the city council's summary of the public records/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance. 
(h)  Responsibility of owner to obtain required approvals. The granting of any permit, variance, or subdivision approval under provisions of this division shall in no way affect the owner's capability or responsibility to obtain the approval required by any other statute or ordinance or legislation of any state agency or subdivision thereof. Approval may be expressly given in conjunction with other permits applied for, but no approval shall be implied from the grant of such permits or from the necessity to apply for a permit as described in this section. 
(i)  Penalties. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this division or any shoreland impact plan approved thereunder shall be guilty of an offense punishable as a misdemeanor each day or portion thereof that the violation continues. In addition, any and all permits and approvals extended by the city in connection with the property on which the violation occurs may be suspended or revoked after notice and an opportunity to be heard, and the city may also deny a certificate of occupancy or pursue injunctive relief and/or damages. Pursuit of any one of these remedies does not waive the city's right to pursue any or all of these remedies. In addition, a person violating subsection 36-694(c) shall provide a cash escrow to the city in an amount of up to 150 percent of the replacement and restoration costs to ensure compliance.

    *Platted lots existing September 30, 1976, shall be exempt from this requirement. 
(1)  Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those stated in subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section will not be allowed. 
(2)  Only land above the ordinary high-water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both the ordinary high-water level and at the building line. The sewered lot area dimensions in subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section can only be used if publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property. 
(3)  Subdivisions of duplexes, triplexes, and quads on natural environment lakes must also meet the following standards: 
a.  Each building must be set back at least 200 feet from the ordinary high-water level; 
b.  Each building must be connected to public sewer and water; 
c.  Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be centralized in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and 
d.  No more than 25 percent of a lake's shoreline can be in duplex, triplex, or quad developments. 
(4)  Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as recreation areas for use by owners of non-riparian lots within subdivisions shall require a conditional use permit and must meet or exceed the following standards: 
a.  They must meet the width and size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended use. 
b.  Persons desiring to plat or develop such lots shall submit with a subdivision or other development application a proposed docking, launching and/or mooring plan, which plan shall set forth therein all such facilities to be used by the landowners within the proposed development. 
1.  Such plan shall set forth the location and size of the proposed docking, launching and/or mooring facilities to be used by the landowners within the proposed development. 
2.  No such facility shall be constructed upon waters or lakes or upon land contiguous thereto when the usage of such facilities is to be by the owner of land which land has been developed or platted subsequent to July 7, 1976, without the facilities having been approved by the city council. 
3.  The city council shall, when considering approval of any such docking, launching and/or mooring facilities for usage on waters or lakes within the city, approve only such facilities which centralize the docking, launching and/or mooring or watercraft owned or used by landowners within the development. 
4.  The city council shall, before granting approval of any such facilities, consider the watercraft use density of the area and shall make a finding that the approval of such facilities does not disproportionately increase average watercraft use density found on other shoreland properties in the area. 
5.  This subsection b shall not apply to a riparian single-family lot separately owned and not subject to a public walkway or trail easement adjacent to the shoreline. 
c.  If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the frontage of the lot as measured at the ordinary high-water level, and keeping the same lot depth, must be increased by the percent of the requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six, consistent with the following table: 
CONTROLLED ACCESS LOT FRONTAGE REQUIREMENTS 
Ratio of Lake Size to Shore Length 
(percent) Required Increase in Frontage

d.  Such lots must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of non-riparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lots. 
e.  Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. 
1.  The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. 
2.  The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(b)  Setbacks. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high-water level, provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Otherwise, structures shall be located as follows: 
(1)  The setback from the normal high-water mark shall be as follows: 
Setback from

1.  Stairways shall be of wood, open stairway construction, stained or painted in earth tones, or otherwise treated so as to blend with the natural surroundings of the setback area. 
2.  Stairways and landings may either be constructed above the ground on posts or pilings or installed directly into the ground or hillside wherever reasonably possible, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion. 
3.  Steps shall be no wider than three feet. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties and public open space recreational properties. 
4.  Landings shall be no wider or deeper than double the width of the steps and must not exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for commercial properties and public open space recreational properties. 
5.  Stairways shall be built in compliance with the city's building code. 
6.  Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways or landings. 
7.  Stairways and landings must be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical. 
8.  Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subsections 1 through 7 of this subsection are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations Chapter 1340. 
i.  Any concrete, blacktop, or other such nonporous walkway, driveway, or double-track vehicle access having a total width of more than five feet, except that this prohibition shall not apply to public improvements. 
j.  Gazebos, screen houses, and pump houses. 
k.  Any other structure, improvement, material or use that does not provide the property owner with access to and from lake waters, or that would tend to pollute or otherwise make dangerous the waters of a rising lake as debris or otherwise, or might otherwise be a threat to the public's health, safety or welfare. 
l.  Wind energy conversion systems. 
m.  Photovoltaic or solar thermal systems not on a building. 
(5)  For lakes, ponds or flowages, no structure shall be placed in violation of article VII, division 4, of this chapter. 
(6)  Regulations for shoreland district lakeshore setback fences are set forth in section 36-816(g). 
(7)  Additions for decks, uncovered porches or patios shall be subject to the following setbacks: 
a.  All decks, uncovered porches or patios added to homes built after the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived (March 20, 1975) shall comply with setback requirements in this subsection (b). 
b.  All decks, uncovered porches or patios that may encroach into required setback areas, if added to homes built before March 20, 1975, will be considered subject to the following: 
1.  Deck encroachments lakeward beyond the existing building line will be considered only after all other alternative locations and designs have been evaluated and found to be impractical. 
2.  The maximum allowable deck, uncovered porch, or patio lakeward of the building line shall not exceed 15 percent of the structure's existing setback. The minimum setback, however, for any deck, uncovered porch or patio shall be no less than 50 percent of the required setback distance for each lake class (natural environment, recreational development and general development) and tributary streams. 
3.  Any deck, uncovered porch or patio that is constructed closer than the required setback from the normal ordinary water elevation shall be constructed of wood and be stained or painted in earth tones, or otherwise treated so as to blend with the natural surroundings of the setback area. 
4.  Decks, porches or patios shall not be screened in or roofed under any circumstances. 
(8)  Except as provided in section 36-8 and articles III and IV of this chapter, all structures in residential districts must not exceed 30 feet in height. The limitation contained in this subsection (8) does not apply to churches, nonresidential agricultural structures, or multiple dwellings, but their height may be subject to limitations set forth in articles III and IV of this chapter. 
(9)  The zoning administrator must evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation. No structure shall be placed in any area which will require grading and/or filling which will result in impairment of public waters by reason of erosion and sedimentation, violate provisions of statewide standards and criteria for management of floodplain areas of the state, or result in impairment of fish or aquatic life. 
(10)  The terms of this subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to property owned by the city or any other political subdivision or public governmental body where the city council finds that a proposed use, although not in compliance with such provisions, will preserve the natural features of a site's amenities, or will be an enhancement to the public function of a site or the public facility on the site, and will not diminish the storage capacity of the affected waters. 
(11)  Unless otherwise provided, any structure, improvement, material or use for which a permit or other review or permission is not already required elsewhere in this Code shall require a permit from the zoning administrator prior to the placement or construction thereof in any setback area required by this section. Application for such a permit shall be made in writing by the property owner and delivered to the city's community development department. 
a.  The application shall include a description of the proposed structure, improvement, material or use in sufficient detail so as to enable the zoning administrator to assess compliance with this division or lack thereof. 
b.  The zoning administrator may request such additional information from the applicant as is necessary to review the application and may require the applicant to modify the proposal as a condition to receiving a permit or may refuse to issue a permit if the proposal is contrary to this division. 
(c)  Alterations of vegetation and topography. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat. 
(1)  Vegetation alterations. 
a.  Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures, public trails, sewage treatment systems, roads and parking areas regulated by subsection (d) of this section are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow. 
b.  Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural uses as regulated in subsection (f)(2) of this section, is allowed subject to the following standards: 
1.  Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. 
2.  Within the bluff impact zone and the shore impact zone, it shall be unlawful for any person to remove from privately owned land any tree eight inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) or larger without immediately replacing any such tree in the manner required herein, unless removal is authorized by the shore impact plan. 
3.  In shore impact and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement, if allowed, of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted structures or facilities, provided that the screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced. 
4.  The provisions of subsections 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection are not meant to limit the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards, nor are they meant to prevent normal and ordinary lawn maintenance. 
5.  Removal of invasive plant species, or noxious weeds as described in section 14-127, shall be allowed to be removed after the submittal and approval of a shore impact plan as described in subsection 36-693(d).

11.  No grading or filling shall be permitted within 20 feet of the normal high-water mark of a water body. Notwithstanding this restriction, grading or filling in connection with the following improvements may be made within the 20 feet so long as any permit required for the improvement has first been issued: beaches, landscaping for slope stabilization, erosion protection, installation of public or private utilities, and public improvements. 
12.  Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties. 
13.  Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed four feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high-water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high-water level does not exceed three feet. Such riprap shall not be permitted solely for decorative purposes. 
e.  Connections to public waters shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Any work which will change or diminish the course, current, or cross section of a public water must be approved by the state department of natural resources and city before the work is begun. This includes construction of channels and ditches, lagooning, dredging of the lake bottom for the removal of muck, silt or weeds, and filling in the lake bed, including low-lying marsh areas. Approval shall be construed to mean the issuance of a conditional use permit by the city and the issuance by the commissioner of natural resources of a permit pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 103G.315 and other related statutes. 
2.  Excavation on shorelands where the intended purpose is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, shall require a permit from the city engineer prior to commencement of construction. Such permit shall be obtained only after the state commissioner of natural resources has approved the proposed connection to public waters. Approval will be given only if the proposed work is consistent with applicable state regulations for work in beds of public waters. 
(d)  Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas. 
(1)  Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters.

a.  When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters. 
b.  Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, and erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site. 
c.  When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. 
(2)  Specific standards. 
a.  Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 30 percent of the lot area, unless there is provided mitigating stormwater infrastructure acceptable to and approved by the commissioner and all other authorities having jurisdiction over stormwater management for the lot.

c.  New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before discharge. 
(f)  Special provisions for commercial, industrial, and agricultural uses. 
(1)  Commercial and industrial uses. Surface-water-oriented commercial uses and industrial uses with similar needs are prohibited. Commercial uses and industrial uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high-water level setback or be substantially screened, blended, or camouflaged from view from the water by vegetation, topography, or architecture, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(2)  Agriculture uses. 
a.  General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan (resource management systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts or the United States Soil Conservation Service. The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high-water level. 
b.  Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are located within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water level or within a bluff impact zone are allowed if they do not further encroach into the existing ordinary high-water level setback or encroach on bluff impact zones. 
(g)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas shall be subject to the review and approval procedures, and criteria and conditions for review of conditional uses, established community-wide. The following additional evaluation criteria and conditions apply within shoreland areas and are in addition to the requirements of article II, division 4, of this chapter: 
(1)  A thorough evaluation of the water body and the topographic, vegetation, and soils conditions on the site must be made to ensure:

c.  Placement of septic tank soil absorption systems/on-site sewage treatment systems shall be subject to the following setback requirements where soil conditions are adequate and where public sewer is not available: 
1.  On natural environment lakes, at least 150 feet from the normal high-water mark; 
2.  On recreational development lakes, at least 75 feet from the normal high-water mark; 
3.  On general development lakes and tributary streams, at least 50 feet from the normal high-water mark. 
d.  A septic tank/drainfield system shall be the only acceptable system for installation where public sewer is not available unless it can be demonstrated that this system is not feasible on the particular lot in question and it can be demonstrated that the system being proposed as an alternative will not cause a pollution problem. 
e.  No person shall install, alter, repair or extend any individual sewage disposal system without first obtaining a permit therefor from the director of fire and building inspection services for the specific installation, alteration, repair or extension. 
f.  Location and installation of a septic and soil absorption system (where public sewer is not available) shall be such that, with reasonable maintenance, it will function in a sanitary manner and will not create a nuisance, endanger the quality of any domestic water supply, or pollute or contaminate any waters of the state. If the determination of a site's suitability cannot be made with publicly available existing information, it shall then be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient soil borings and percolation tests from on-site field investigations. In determining a suitable location for the system, consideration shall be given to the following:

1.  Low swampy areas or areas subject to recurrent flooding; 
2.  Areas where the highest known groundwater table, bedrock or impervious soils conditions are within four feet of the bottom of the system; and 
3.  Areas where ground slope will create a danger of seepage of the effluent onto the surface of the ground. 
h.  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems shall be regulated and upgrading in accordance with section 36-696(3). 
(Code 1984, § 375:108(5); Ord. No. 08-07, § 1, 5-5-2008; Ord. No. 09-11, § 2, 10-5-2009; Ord. No. 19-04, § 1, 3-18-2019) 
Sec. 36-696. - Nonconformities. 
    Nonconforming lots, structures, and uses shall be governed by the provisions of section 36-6. In addition, the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas. Where there is a conflict between this section and section 36-6, the conflict shall be resolved in such a manner that will tend to eliminate or bring into compliance the nonconformity. 
(1)  Construction on nonconforming lots. 
a.  A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating any proposed variance, the city council shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided. 
b.  If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of section 36-695(a) and (b), the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of section 36-695(a) and (b) as much as possible. 
(2)  Outside dimensions, additions or expansions. All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other requirements of section 36-695. Any deviation from these requirements must be authorized by a variance pursuant to article II, division 5 of this chapter and section 36-693(c). 
(3)  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems. 
a.  A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of section 36-695(h) must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high-water level. However, sanitary facilities shall be discontinued when there is evidence of septic tank effluent percolating from the ground flowing directly into a lake or stream, or other indications of system failure. 
b.  The city intends to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems in the S shoreland district. Any nonconforming system identified by this program shall be upgraded or replaced within a reasonable period of time, which will not exceed two years from notice of such identification. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minn. Stats. §§ 103F.201-103F.221, and their predecessors, in effect at the time of installation, may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the state pollution control agency's chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered nonconforming. 
(Code 1984, § 375:108(6)) 
Sec. 36-697. - Subdivision and platting. 
    The subdivision and platting requirements of chapter 30 shall apply to land in the S shoreland district. In addition, the following requirements shall also apply: 
(1)  Each lot created through subdivision must be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis shall include, but not be limited to, near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, or any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. 
(2)  Subdivisions must conform to all ordinances and controls of the city. 
(3)  Sufficient information must be submitted by the applicant for the city to make a determination of land suitability. Such information shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  The surface water features required in Minn. Stats. § 505.02, subd. 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from United States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate sources; 
b.  Information regarding extent of anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations, and near-shore aquatic conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic vegetation; 
c.  Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway districts from existing adopted maps or data; and 
d.  A line or contour representing the ordinary high-water level, the toe and the top of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream. 
(4)  Easements shall be dedicated over natural drainage or ponding areas for management of stormwater and significant wetlands. 
(5)  Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or for recreational use areas for use by nonriparian lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the sizing criteria in section 36-695(a)(6).

(c)  Required information. The applicant for a PUD must submit the following documents prior to final action being taken on the application request: 
(1)  A site plan and/or plat for the project showing locations of property boundaries, surface water features, existing and proposed structures and other facilities, land alterations, sewage treatment and water supply systems (where public systems are not available), and topographic contours at two-foot intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined commercial and residential development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate and distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are residential, commercial, or a combination of the two. 
(2)  A property owners' association agreement (for residential PUDs) with mandatory membership, all in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section. 
(3)  Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other instruments that: 
a.  Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations, construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft, and construction of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and 
b.  Ensure the longterm preservation and maintenance of open space in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in subsection (f) of this section. 
(4)  When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied. 
(5)  Those additional documents as requested by the city that are necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will function. 
(d)  Determination of suitable area. Proposed new planned unit developments or expansions to existing planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation under subsection (e) of this section: 
(1)  The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high-water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward: 
SHORELAND TIER DIMENSIONS 
Unsewered 
(feet) Sewered 
(feet) General development lakes-first tier 200 200 General development lakes-second and additional tiers 267 200 Recreational development lakes 267 267 Natural environment lakes 400 320  
(2)  The suitable area within each tier is calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high-water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites. 
(e)  Dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation. The procedures for determining the "base" density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer to the water body. 
(1)  Residential PUD "base" density evaluation. The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses in this section and the design criteria in subsection (f) of this section. 
(2)  Commercial PUD "base" density evaluation. 
a.  Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space. 
b.  Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table:

    *For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home or, if unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet. 
c.  Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites. 
d.  Divide the total floor area by tier computed in under subsection (e)(2)c of this section by the average inside living area size determined under subsection a of this subsection. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier. 
e.  Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses in this section and the design criteria in subsection (f) of this section. 
(3)  Density increase multipliers. 
a.  Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities determined under subsection (e)(1) or (2) of this section are allowable if the dimensional standards in section 36-695 are met or exceeded and the design criteria in subsection (f) of this section are satisfied. The allowable density increases under subsection (e)(3)b of this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high-water level are increased to at least 50 percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the city and the setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum setback. 
b.  Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential or commercial planned unit developments are as follows: 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase Within Each Tier 
(percent) First  50 Second 100 Third 200 Fourth 200 Fifth 200

(3)  Erosion control and stormwater management. Erosion control and stormwater management plans must be developed and the PUD must: 
a.  Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure. 
1.  Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. 
2.  Erosion control plans approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project size and site physical characteristics warrants. 
b.  Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier must not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that for commercial PUDs 35 percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and consistency with section 36-695(c). 
(4)  Centralization and design of facilities and structures. Centralization and design of facilities and structures must be done according to the following standards: 
a.  Planned unit developments must be connected to publicly owned water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or exceed applicable standards or rules of the state department of health and sections 36-695(b) and 36-695(h). On-site sewage treatment systems must be located on the most suitable areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage system. 
b.  Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas of the development.

e.  Accessory structures and facilities must meet the required principal structure setback and must be centralized. 
f.  Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if they meet or exceed design standards contained in section 36-695(b) and are centralized. 
(5)  Conversion of existing uses and facilities. Existing land uses and facilities may be converted to residential planned unit developments if all of the following standards are met: 
a.  Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same procedures for residential planned unit developments involving all new construction. Inconsistencies between existing features of the development and these standards must be identified. 
b.  Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure color, impervious coverage, open space, and shore recreation facilities must be corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the conditional use permit. 
c.  Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be evaluated and reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must include, where applicable, the following: 
1.  Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that no longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones; 
2.  Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from the water; and 
3.  If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact zones, conditions attached to approvals of conversions that preclude exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations. The conditions must also provide for future relocation of dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback and elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced. 
(6)  Densities. Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed standards in subsection (e) of this section may be allowed to continue but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the time of conversion or in the future. Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of high densities by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore recreation facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.

Sec. 36-725. - Applicability; right of entry. 
(a)  The T tree preservation district shall be applied to and superimposed upon any residential, commercial, or industrial district contained in this chapter. The regulations and requirements imposed by the T tree preservation district shall be in addition to floodplain, shoreland, and wetland regulations and requirements, and those established for the district wherein property is located, which regulations and requirements will all jointly apply to the property. Under the joint application of districts, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 
(b)  The areas affected by the terms of the T tree preservation district within the city shall be identified in a map adopted by the city council as a T tree preservation district map. The map shall be incorporated by reference as though fully set forth in this section. The legal descriptions of the T tree preservation district area are on file with the city clerk. In addition, the city may, based upon guidelines recommended by the arbor committee and approved by the city council, designate any tree for preservation because of any unique physical characteristic or growth process, or some historical or cultural significance. Such trees shall be known as landmark trees, and a list of such trees shall also be maintained in the office of the city clerk and shall be a part of this division as if fully set forth in this section. 
(c)  The T district designations may be reviewed annually to ensure all designations are correct. Areas may be added or deleted as changes and plantings occur. Employees and representatives of the city may enter upon private property to inspect and identify trees in furtherance of the provisions of section 36-721 and this section after having given notice to the owner/occupant. Notice will be adequate if made in person or, if in writing, stating date and time of the anticipated entry upon the property and identifying the city and the ordinance pursuant to which the entry is being made. Such notice, if not personal notice, shall be mailed by certified mail addressed to the owner/occupant at the address last shown on the county tax records in city offices and mailed in the United States mail at least four days prior to the anticipated entry. Failure of the addressee to receive such notice does not invalidate the notice or the entry. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(2)) 
Sec. 36-726. - Restrictions for properties not undergoing development. 
    For purposes of tree removal on land within a T preservation district not in the process of being subdivided or developed, it shall be unlawful for any person to remove from privately owned land any tree eight inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) or larger in excess of the rate of 32 inches DBH per acre in any calendar year without immediately replacing any such tree pursuant to the appropriate ratio set forth in section 36-728 unless provided otherwise in a previously approved forest management plan approved by the city as set forth in section 36-727. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(3)) 
Sec. 36-727. - Forest management plan. 
(a)  Application. Any person desiring approval of a forest management plan as an alternative to the requirements of section 36-726 shall submit a written application to the city's community development department prepared by a natural resource professional. This application shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name and address of applicant. 
(2)  Status of applicant with respect to the land. 
(3)  Written consent of the owner of the land, if applicant is not the owner. 
(4)  Name of person preparing any map, drawing or diagram submitted with the application. 
(5)  Location of the property, including a street address and legal description. 
(6)  Measure and map of the parcel of land, specifically designating all forested areas, the existing and proposed use of such areas, and actual dimensions of the areas. 
(7)  Location of all proposed or existing structures, roads, utilities, and driveways on the site. 
(8)  A written narrative describing the activities to be undertaken, the reasons for developing the plan, specific actions proposed by the forest management plan, and how those actions and activities will benefit the forest as an urban amenity, rather than their value for lumber or some other economic purpose. Specific examples of such benefit include, but are not limited to, better forest management (thinning or removal of certain tree species), improved wildlife habitat, creation of forest products (tree farming), recreation use, outdoor education, trails, and energy conservation. 
(b)  Additional requirements. The community development director may, in addition, require the applicant for approval of a forest management plan to supply: 
(1)  A site plan specifying the methods to be used to preserve all remaining trees and their root systems. 
(2)  Such other information as the community development director deems necessary for review of the proposed plan. 
(c)  Review; action by council; termination; revocation. Upon receipt of the application, representatives of the city may visit and inspect the site and adjoining lands. Prior to voting upon a forest management plan, the city may solicit the opinion of a forester. If the city council determines that the plan will not destroy any designated or proposed landmark tree; will preserve positive attributes relative to stabilization of soil, water quality, and drainage; and will be for the good of the forest, it may approve the forest management plan by a majority vote. If the council determines otherwise, the application shall be denied. 
(1)  If the city council denies a forest management plan, it shall set forth in writing the reasons for denial. 
(2)  An approved forest management plan shall remain in effect until a request to develop all or part of the property in the plan is filed with the city, which event shall automatically terminate the plan, or until the applicant, or the applicant's heirs, successors, or assigns, and the city agree to terminate the plan. 
(3)  The city council may, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, revoke an approved forest management plan if it determines, through inspection or otherwise, that such plan is not being followed. Upon such revocation, the basic restrictions of this division shall apply to the affected property as if no forest management plan had ever been approved for that property, and those restrictions shall continue to apply unless a new forest management plan for the property is approved at sometime in the future. 
(d)  Any request for amendment of an approved forest management plan shall be processed and reviewed as if it were an initial application for such a plan, unless one or more application requirements in subsection (a) and (b) of this section are specifically waived by the city council by a majority vote. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(8)) 
Sec. 36-728. - Tree preservation standards associated with site development. 
    Unless provided otherwise in an approved forest management plan set forth in section 36-727, the conditions following the submission requirements in this section shall apply to removal of trees having a trunk diameter of eight inches or more DBH. 
(1)  Application. Any person desiring to develop all or part of any property within a tree preservation district shall submit an application (subdivision, site plan, planned unit development, among others) to the city's community development department together with a filing fee as set forth in chapter 16, article XI, of this Code. Accompanying the appropriate application shall be the following: 
a.  Tree inventory. Tree inventory shall include the species, diameter, condition and location of all trees at least eight DBH inches and shall be prepared by a forester, natural resources specialist, certified arborist, landscape architect or another qualified individual. Such qualified individual shall require approval by the community development director. 
b.  Tree preservation plan. The tree preservation plan shall show and specify: 
1.  Total diameter inches and species composition of trees at least eight DBH inches to be preserved; 
2.  Total number of diameter inches of trees to be removed; 
3.  Limits of tree clearing, tree protection zones and fencing; 
4.  Location, size and species of replacement trees required in section; 
5.  Construction staging areas for parking and material storage including concrete washout areas; 
6.  Location of all underground utilities. 
(2)  Standards of preservation during subdivision. 
a.  Seventy percent of the total tree inches for trees at least eight DBH inches of the site within the designated tree preservation district shall be protected. If more than 30 percent of the total DBH of trees on the site are removed due to the installation of streets and utilities and the grading necessitated by subdividing, the excess shall be replaced at a ratio of 11/2 inches of replacement for every DBH inch of removal above 30 percent. 
b.  These standards for tree protection shall apply in all zoning districts during subdivision. 
c.  Further requirements during subdivision are set forth in chapter 30, pertaining to subdivisions, and include, but are not limited to, section 30-16(3)m. 
(3)  Standards of preservation during construction or excavation after subdivision or when not connected with subdivision. 
a.  Single-family detached and two-family dwellings. In subdivisions in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zoning districts, the builder shall be responsible for working with the community development department for the protection of the trees to be preserved on a particular lot. The building pad shall include an area from the front lot line to a line 85 feet behind the front lot line. The building pad shall extend across the entire width of the lot. The builder shall be required to replace trees removed from within the building pad on a basis of 1/2 inch of replacement for each DBH inch of removal. Trees protected within the building pad may count toward replacement at a ratio of two inches of replacement for every DBH inch of trees protected. If trees are removed from the area outside the building pad, they shall be replaced on the following basis: 
Specimen Trunk Size Replacement Criteria 8" to 11" DBH 1 1/2? of trees shall be replaced for every DBH inch removed >11" DBH 2" of trees shall be replaced for every DBH inch removed  
b.  Attached single-family dwellings and apartments. Lots on which attached single-family dwellings and apartments are constructed shall retain 40 percent of the DBH inches existing on the lot after the actions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been completed. If trees in excess of 60 percent are removed from the lot due to construction, they will be replaced on a basis of 11/2 inches DBH of replacement for every DBH inch removed in excess of 60 percent. 
c.  Residential planned unit development (PUD). The tree cover in a residential PUD shall be preserved in greater amount than in a single-family subdivision because of the flexibility in standards available to avoid tree removal. Seventy percent of the DBH inches existing in a residential PUD after the actions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been completed shall be retained after the development is completed. If trees are removed during construction in excess of 30 percent, they shall be replaced at a ratio of two inches of replacement for each DBH inch removed in excess of 30 percent. 
d.  Industrial. Sites on which industrial buildings and facilities are constructed shall retain 40 percent of the DBH inches existing on the site after the actions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been completed. If trees in excess of 60 percent are removed from the site due to construction, they will be replaced on a basis of 11/2 inches of replacement for every DBH inch removed in excess of 60 percent. 
e.  Commercial. Sites on which commercial buildings and facilities are constructed shall retain 30 percent of the DBH inches existing on the site after the actions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been completed. If trees in excess of 70 percent are removed from the site due to construction, they will be replaced on a basis of 11/2 inches of replacement for every DBH inch removed in excess of 70 percent. 
f.  Commercial and industrial PUDs. Sites on which commercial and industrial PUD buildings and facilities are constructed shall retain 40 percent of the DBH inches existing on the site after the actions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section have been completed. If trees in excess of 60 percent are removed from the site due to construction, they will be replaced on a basis of two inches of replacement for every DBH inch removed in excess of 60 percent. 
(4)  Standards of preservation in all other circumstances. Whenever trees are removed under any circumstances other than those identified in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, preservation and replacement ratios set forth in subsection (3) shall apply. 
(5)  Survey of trees prior to issuance of building permit. Prior to the issuance of a building permit by the city for a lot within a development subject to the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, the applicant for such building permit shall provide a certified survey of the lot or lots for which the building permit is to be issued identifying the location, size and species of all trees eight inches DBH or larger in size. Such survey shall indicate trees that are to be removed and those that are to be saved. Diagrams of protective fencing shall be shown on the survey consistent with section 36-731. If required by the city, a tree replacement plan shall be provided complying with the provisions of subsection (3) of this subsection. 
(6)  Survey to tree prior to approval of occupancy. Prior to the city approving final occupancy for any structure contained within a tree preservation district, the applicant for such occupancy shall provide a certified survey of the lot verifying the information required in subsection (5) of this section. If the city determines that additional tree inches are removed after the completion of site improvements based on the survey, the city may require additional tree replacement. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(4)) 
Sec. 36-729. - Site signage. 
    Prior to any tree being removed pursuant to subsection 36-728(2) or (3), the property owner shall cause to be posted on the perimeter of the site involved in the subdivision, excavation or construction activity signs readily visible to and understandable by the public identifying the trees and activity on the site as being subject to the provisions of tree preservation zoning regulations of the city. Such signs will be provided by the city, shall be placed at intervals of at least one sign per street frontage in proximity to planned entrances and shall remain in place until the activity has passed final approval by the city departments monitoring it. In addition, the property owner shall securely attach signs to the tree protection fence required under section 36-731 every 50 feet of protection fencing or portion thereof. Such signs will be provided by the city. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(5)) 
Sec. 36-730. - Replacement standards. 
(a)  As shown on a tree preservation plan required in section 36-728 (1)b, replacement shall occur in the area from which the trees are removed. If this is not desirable for the health or survival of the replacement trees, the trees shall be replanted elsewhere within the T zone from which the trees were removed. If this is also undesirable for the health or survival of the replacement trees, then the replanting may occur outside of the designated T zone but shall occur within the development. If this is not desirable for the health or survival of the replacement trees, then the landowner shall consult and work with the city to determine a better alternative planting location for the replacement trees. 
(b)  Any replanting shall be done with trees of the primary species of the affected forest. At planting, the trunks of deciduous trees shall be at 21/2 inches in diameter as measured six inches above the ground. Coniferous trees shall be at least five feet in height. 
(c)  Replacement trees shall be identified as such until they are eight inches in DBH, shall be considered at least eight inches in DBH regardless of size and shall be treated accordingly for purposes of this division. 
(d)  If any replanting is to occur outside the limits of the T zone, the parcel on which the replanting occurs shall be rezoned so as to be governed by the provisions of the T zone, or a covenant acceptable to the city shall be recorded by the property owner so as to make the provisions of this division applicable to the parcel on which the replanting occurs. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(6)) 
Sec. 36-731. - Tree protection. 
(a)  Trees designated for preservation shall be protected by a highly visible fence or other temporary structure deemed acceptable by the city. The protection area shall be defined by the projection of the tree dripline downward to the ground. If less protection is necessary due to the proximity of building structures or infrastructure, such reduced protection area shall require approval by the city prior to any construction activity taking place. 
(b)  The location and means of tree protection shall require inspection and approval by the city prior to any construction activity taking place. The city shall also inspect the construction site during construction. The tree protection shall remain in place until the city has conducted an inspection of the lot and has approved the removal of the fencing. 
(c)  No equipment, chemicals, soil deposits or construction materials shall be placed within a protective barrier. 
(d)  Any landscaping activity subsequent to the removal of the barriers shall be accomplished with hand labor or light machinery having a gross weight of no more than 1,000 pounds. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(7)) 
Sec. 36-732. - Performance guarantee. 
    Based upon the replacement trees identified in section 36-730, and prior to any construction activity taking place, the applicant shall submit a cash escrow, letter of credit or other surety acceptable to the city in the amount of 100 percent of the cost of the replacement trees proposed for the project area. Such surety shall remain in force for two full growing seasons following installation of the of the replacement trees to guarantee survival. At the end of the two-year period or subsequent two-year period, the city shall review the project area in coordination with the applicant and shall make a determination to: 
(1)  Refund the appropriate performance surety; or 
(2)  Require the planting of new trees to replace the replacement trees which did not survive the initial or subsequent two full growing seasons or subsequent periods until such time as the replacement trees have survived two full growing seasons. 
For purposes of this section, all trees shall be alive and in satisfactory growing condition at the end of two full growing seasons. The growing season shall include the period May 1 through October 31. The two-year guaranty period for plant materials installed after June 1 shall commence the following year. 
(Code 1984, § 375:109(9)) 
Sec. 36-733. - Exceptions. 
    The provisions of this division shall not apply to: 
(1)  The removal of trees from commercial nurseries or horticultural properties, such as tree farms, orchards or commercial forests. This exception shall not be interpreted to include lumber harvesting incidental to imminent development of the land. 
(2)  The removal of trees on public rights-of-way conducted by or on behalf of a federal, state, county, municipal, or other governmental agency in pursuance of its lawful activities or functions in the construction or improvement of public rights-of-way. 
(3)  The removal of trees deemed by the community development director to be diseased, dying, or dead. 
(4)  The removal of any tree which has become or threatens to become a danger to human life or property. 
(5)  The removal of any tree by a public utility when such tree has the reasonable potential of endangering the facilities operated by the utility.

DIVISION 7. - W WETLAND SYSTEMS DISTRICT 

Sec. 36-751. - Findings; intent. 
(a)  Wetlands help maintain water quality, serve to minimize problems with flooding and erosion, serve as sources of food and habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife, and are an integral part of the community's natural landscape, providing the aesthetic benefits of open space and a natural separation of land uses. It is the intent of this division to establish a policy of sound stewardship through coordination of regulations that strive toward zero degradation and no net loss of the wetlands by conserving, protecting, and enhancing these environmentally sensitive resources. In addition, it is the intent of the city to promote the restoration of degraded wetlands where feasible and practical. It is the city's intent that the use of sound planning policies should strive to first avoid alteration to wetlands. Where alteration of wetlands cannot be avoided, then wetland loss shall be mitigated. 
(b)  The primary goal of this division is to avoid wetland impact by careful design of development proposals. An applicant for a wetland alteration has the obligation to demonstrate, to the city's satisfaction, that reasonable alternatives to the action have been explored. The city must find that the alternatives are inappropriate or that a wetland enhancement would result for the city to approve the wetland alteration. Mitigation should always result in an improvement to the wetland function and value. The wetland function and value will include improvement of water quality, maintaining the hydrological balance and provision of wildlife habitat. 
(Code 1984, § 375:111(1)) 
Sec. 36-752. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to ensure the protection of the general health, safety and welfare of the residents and the protection of the wetland resources of the city, now and in the future, through preservation and conservation of wetlands and sound management of development by: 
(1)  Establishment of wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood protection and water quality programs. 
(2)  Requiring sound management practices that will protect, conserve, maintain, enhance, and improve the present quality of wetlands within the community. 
(3)  Requiring sound management designed to maintain and improve water quality in streams and lakes with its attendant increase in recreational use and value. 
(4)  Protecting and enhancing the scenic value of the wetland. 
(5)  Restricting and controlling the harmful effects of land development which adversely affect wetlands, which harmful effects include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Improper erosion control practices. 
b.  Rapid runoff from developed areas. 
c.  Pollution from gas, oil, salt, fertilizer, sand, silt, and other materials. 
d.  Dumping of waste in wetlands. 
e.  Unrestricted placement of structures within wetland areas. 
f.  Lack of a buffer strip to protect the perimeter of the wetland. 
(6)  Allowing only development that is planned to be compatible with wetland protection and enhancement. 
(7)  Providing standards for the alteration of wetlands when permitted by the city. 
(8)  Mitigating impact of development adjacent to wetland areas. 
(9)  Educating and informing the public regarding the function of wetlands and the impact of urbanization upon wetlands. 
(10)  Obtaining protective easements over or acquiring fee title to wetlands as opportunities occur. 
(Code 1984, § 375:111(2))

(3)  The screening shall be constructed with materials that are architecturally compatible with the building. 
(4)  The use of wood, in whole or in part, as a screening material shall not be considered as being architecturally compatible unless the building is constructed with a wood exterior. 
(d)  Screening of commercial and industrial buildings. All nonresidential principal buildings or structures and any building or structure accessory thereto shall be screened in accordance with the requirements of this section from lots in any R-1, R-2, or R-3 district which are used for dwellings and which are located within 200 feet of the nonresidential use. Such distance shall be the shortest distance between the nonresidential building or structure to be screened and the nearest lot line of the residential use, but shall not apply if such uses are separated by a public street.

(g)  Buffer yards. 
(1)  Width of buffer area. Where a buffer yard is required for property which abuts residentially zoned property, there shall be within the required setback a landscaped area at least 20 feet in width for the first 100 parking spaces located on such abutting property, which area shall extend along and be adjacent to the entire length of all common property lines shared with the residentially zoned property. The width of the buffer area shall be increased by ten feet for every additional 100 parking spaces provided on the abutting lot. 
(2)  Fence or berm required. 
a.  The buffer area shall contain a fence of four to six feet in height, which fence shall be located on the abutting lot within one foot of the common property line. 
b.  On industrially zoned property, an elongated earthen mound (berm) may be constructed rather than the fence required in subsection a of this subsection. Any such berm shall be constructed the entire length of the buffer yard and shall be continuous or provide the illusion of continuity when viewed from the side and perpendicular to the berm. 
c.  Any such berm shall have a slope of three feet horizontal to one foot vertical and shall not be located within any street right-of-way unless approved by the city engineer. The berm shall be constructed so as to obstruct, for adjoining properties, views beyond the berm to the screening height prescribed by the formula set forth in the preceding sentence. 
d.  To provide visual variation, the minimum height of the berm may be decreased slightly at varying intervals. Such variations shall not result at any point in a berm height less than 80 percent of the height required by the formula in subsection c of this subsection, or result in a concentrated area of berm height reduction so as not to provide the screening benefits intended by the berm, or result in berm height reduction along more than 20 percent of the total length of the buffer yard. 
e.  In those areas where the height of the berm is reduced, landscape screening in addition to that required in subsection (g)(2) of this section must be provided as determined necessary by the zoning administrator to fulfill the purpose of the berm.
