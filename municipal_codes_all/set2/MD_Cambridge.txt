PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cambridge, Maryland. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of this republication were the 1975 Code, as republished in 1992 and supplemented through July 21, 2008, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between Sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Tassy Spinks, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Edwin C. Kinnamon, City Clerk/Treasurer, and other officers of the city for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(P.L.L. 1930, art. 10, § 64; 1961 Code, § 53; 1920, ch. 99, § 58A) 
Editor's note- See the editor's note following § 3-18. 
A fire zone and building ordinance of the City of Cambridge, which prohibits the erecting, repairing or remodeling of any building therein enumerated, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the city commissioners, is a valid exercise of the police power conferred upon the city. Engle v. Cambridge, 180 Md. 82, 22A.2d 922 (1941). 
Action of the city commissioners of Cambridge in refusing to grant a permit for the construction of a brick building to be used as a garage, salesroom and service station for repairing automobiles, was not discriminatory merely because other permits for other garages had been issued several years before, without objections being filed thereto, and prior to the erection of most of the residences in the neighborhood. Engle v. Cambridge, 180 Md. 82, 22A.2d 922 (1941). 
Action of the city commissioners, in refusing a permit for a brick building to be used as a garage, made after a hearing at which a number of citizens who objected to the granting of such permit were present, was not arbitrary. Engle v. Cambridge, 180 Md. 82, 22A.2d 922 (1941). 
An amendment to this section in ch. 422 of the Acts of 1931 was vetoed by the Governor. See pp. 1083 and 1452, 1931 Session Laws.

(1961 Code, § 99; 1947 ch. 339, § 114C) 
Sec. 3-54. - Details of operation. 
    If and when construction or acquisition of a project is definitely contracted for the city shall delegate to a public commission the powers herein conferred on the city of operation, maintenance, repair, improvement and reconstruction of such project, as well as the powers to distribute and sell the electric energy produced thereby and to charge and collect for such energy the rates, fees and charges fixed by the city. Said commission shall be known as the municipal utilities commission and shall consist of three members, all residents of Cambridge, one of whom shall be appointed as chairman, and shall be established by municipal ordinance which, in addition to the provisions hereof, shall prescribe its duties in detail and the compensation of the members thereof. The members of said commission shall be appointed by a majority vote of the Commissioners of Cambridge for initial terms of ten, eight and six years each and thereafter for equal terms of ten years, and one of the members so appointed shall be affiliated with the principal minority party in the city. Any person appointed to said commission may be removed therefrom for misfeasance or malfeasance in office by a two-thirds vote of the Commissioners of Cambridge after due notice to such person of the charges against him and a public hearing on such charges, and any vacancy on said commission created by removal, resignation or death of a member shall be filled by the Commissioners of Cambridge for the unexpired term for which such member was appointed. Said commission shall collect and hold on behalf of the city all charges, fees and rates realized from the operation of the project and shall disburse or deduct from the fund so created all costs and expenses, or reserves therefor, of operation, maintenance, insurance and repair. Subject to approval by the Commissioners of Cambridge, said commission may employ such consulting, technical, operating and clerical personnel as may be needed for the most economical and efficient operation of the project. Every six months the commission shall make a report to the city of its operations, including a financial statement and every three months it shall pay over to the city the net revenues from the project after deduction of the disbursements, expenses and reserves above provided for. The city shall first use the revenues so derived from the project for servicing its outstanding revenue or general obligation bonds issued in connection with the project as hereinafter provided, and after making the payments, if any, necessary for that purpose, the city may add the balance of said net revenues to its general funds for appropriation to any lawful municipal purpose. 
(1961 Code, § 100; 1947, ch. 339, § 114D) 
Sec. 3-55. - General obligation bonds. 
    If the city shall determine that all or any part of a project be acquired by purchase, and if it shall also determine that all or any part of the cost of acquisition shall be borne by the city, it may finance said cost of acquisition by borrowing the requisite sum or sums of money on its full faith and credit, evidencing such borrowing by the issuance and sale at public or private sale of its general obligation bonds in par amount equal to the amount of such borrowing. Such bonds shall be authorized by ordinance and shall be issued in such form as said ordinance may prescribe, provided, however, that said bonds may be issued on a sinking fund or on a serial maturity plan, and if on a serial maturity plan, the last maturity shall not be longer than thirty years from the date of issue. Said bonds shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed four per centum per annum. Said bonds are hereby exempted from the provisions of Sections 34, 35 and 36 of Article 31 of the Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (1939 Edition) [now Ann. Code of Md. art. 31, §§ 9-11] and no limitations on the taxing powers of the city shall constitute any limitation on its power hereby granted to levy upon all assessable property within the corporate limits of the city ad valorem taxes, without limit as to rate or amount, sufficient in each year to provide funds for the payment of the principal and interest of said bonds. Such taxes shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other ad valorem taxes of the city are levied and collected and shall have the same priority and lien as such other taxes. Said bonds and the interest paid thereon in the hands of the persons entitled thereto, from time to time, shall be and remain exempt from all state, county and municipal taxation of any kind and nature whatsoever in the State of Maryland. Notwithstanding the provisions hereof for the issuance of such bonds on the full faith and credit of the city and the payment of the principal and interest of the said bonds from the ad valorem taxes hereby authorized to be levied, such principal and interest shall, to the extent possible, be paid in any year that any of said bonds are outstanding from any surplus revenues or net profits of the project, with respect to which said bonds were issued, not needed for the payment of the principal and interest of the revenue bonds hereinafter authorized. Said general obligation bonds may be made redeemable before maturity in whole or in part at the option of the city, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the city at the time of issuance and the funds for such redemption may be provided by the issue and sale of additional revenue bonds as hereinafter authorized. If said bonds are issued on a sinking fund plan, deposits into said sinking fund shall, to the extent available, be made from the surplus of net revenues of the project with respect to which said bonds were issued, and if, at maturity, said sinking fund is inadequate for the payment of all of said bonds, the additional funds necessary for such payment shall, if possible, be provided by the issuance of additional revenue bonds in the manner hereinafter authorized. The authority conferred by this section shall cease and determine if the cost of acquisition or cost of construction of a project for the city shall be initially financed by the issuance of revenue bonds, and said authority shall be exhausted by one issue of general obligation bonds hereunder. Unless they are inappropriate or in conflict with the provisions of this section, the provisions of section 3-56 specifying the terms and conditions of the revenue bonds shall be applicable to the general obligation bonds above authorized.

The revenue bonds authorized to be issued hereby shall not constitute a debt of the city or a pledge of its faith and credit but such bonds, and the interest thereon, shall be payable solely from the revenues of a project. The city is hereby authorized and empowered by ordinance, at one time and from time to time, to borrow money to pay the cost of acquisition or the cost of construction or both of a project and to issue its revenue bonds in the manner hereinafter prescribed to evidence such borrowing. Each of such bonds shall contain a statement on its face to the effect that the city is not obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from the revenues of a project and that the faith and credit of the city are not pledged to the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds. Before issuing any such revenue bonds, the city shall make or obtain (1) an estimate of cost of acquisition of a project or the cost of its construction or both to be defrayed by the money to be realized from the issuance of such bonds, (2) an estimate of the annual revenues of the project and (3) an estimate of the annual cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project, and no money shall be borrowed and no revenue bonds issued to evidence such borrowing unless the city is satisfied from such estimates that the annual revenues of the project will be sufficient to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating it and, also, the interest on such bonds and the principal thereof as such interest and principal shall become due. 
(b)  Form. Such revenue bonds shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding four percentum per annum, payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the city, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the city, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the city prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The city shall determine the form of the bonds and the interest coupons to be attached thereto, the manner of executing the bonds and coupons, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions hereof shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the state to the extent provided by section 33 of article 31, Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (1939 Edition) [now Ann. Code of Md. art. 31, § 8]. Provision may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the name of the owner as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion of any of the bonds registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. Such bonds may be issued without regards to any limitation on indebtedness prescribed by any other law and shall not be included in the amount of bonds which the city may be authorized to issue under any statute or under its Charter. The city may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the city, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than four per centum per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any redemption premium. Such bonds shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 34, 35, and 36 of article 31, Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (1939 Edition) [now Ann. Code of Md. art. 31, §§ 9-11]. 
(c)  Use of proceeds. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the costs of acquisition or construction of the project they are issued to defray, or applied to the sinking fund created for the payment of such bonds, and such proceeds shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the city may provide. There shall be and there hereby is created and granted a lien upon such moneys until so used in favor of the holders of such bonds or the trustee hereinafter provided for in respect of such bonds. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than said costs, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the ordinance or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority over the bonds first issued for the project. If the proceeds of bonds issued for the project shall exceed said costs the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
(d)  Temporary bonds; replacement of bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the city may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The city may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specified and required hereby. 
(e)  Tax exemption. Said revenue bonds and the interest paid thereon, in the hands of the persons entitled thereto, from time to time, shall be and remain exempt from all state, county and municipal taxation of any kind and nature whatsoever in the State of Maryland. 
(f)  Restrictions. The ordinance providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds and the trust agreement hereinafter authorized, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds, with respect to the project, as the city may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such ordinance or trust agreement. 
(1961 Code, § 102; 1947, ch. 339, § 114F)

Sec. 3-57. - All moneys to be trust funds. 
    All moneys received by the city, its municipal utilities commission or by any bank or trust company, acting as trustee or depository, pursuant to the authority hereof, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, or as rates, charges, fees and other revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided herein. The city shall, in the ordinances authorizing the issuance of general obligation or revenue bonds, or in any trust agreement covering revenue bonds provide that all persons or officials receiving payment of the proceeds of the sale of such bonds and the rates, charges, fees and other revenues to be received from the project shall act as trustees of such funds, and hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as such ordinance or trust agreement may provide. 
(1961 Code, § 103; 1947, ch. 339, § 114G) 
Sec. 3-58. - Trust agreement. 
    In the discretion of the city, each and any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the city and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of this State. Such trust agreement may pledge or assign the net rates, fees, charges and revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Either the ordinance providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the city in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the project or other moneys pertaining thereto be satisfactory to such purchasers. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the city. Such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust agreement may contain such other provisions as the city may deem reasonable and proper for the security of bondholders. Except as herein otherwise provided, the city may provide, by ordinance or by such trust agreement, for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to such officer, commission, board or depositary as it may determine for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out [such] trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project. 
(1961 Code, § 104; 1947, ch. 339, § 114H) 
Sec. 3-59. - Revenues of project. 
    All rates, fees and other charges and all other revenues derived from the project, except such part thereof as may be required by the municipal utilities commission to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project, including reserves therefor, and as may be allocated to such expenses in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust agreement, or such part of said revenues as may be required by such ordinance or trust agreement, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such ordinance or such trust agreement, in a sinking fund which shall be pledged to, and charged with the payment of, (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the revenue bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying the principal and interest, (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as herein provided, and (5) the principal and interest of any general obligation bonds issued hereunder. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust agreement, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such ordinance or trust agreement, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. The moneys in such sinking fund shall be applied to the purchase or redemption of revenue and general obligation bonds in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or of the trust agreement. All bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
(1961 Code, § 105; 1947, ch. 339, § 114I) 
Sec. 3-60. - Remedies of bondholders and trustee. 
(a)  Grant. Any holder of any revenue bonds issued under the provisions hereof or any of the coupons attached thereto, and the trustee under the trust agreement, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the ordinance passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceeding, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Maryland or granted hereunder or under such ordinance or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required hereby, or by such ordinance or trust agreement to be performed by the city or by any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of the rates, fees and other charges for the use of the project or for the services and energy furnished thereby. 
(b)  Default. In the event the city shall default in the payment of the principal of or the interest on any of the revenue bonds as the same become due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption, and such default shall continue for a period of sixty days, or in the event that the city or any of its officers, agents or employees shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions hereof or shall default in any agreement made with the holders of the revenue bonds, any holder of such bonds, subject to the provisions of the ordinance authorizing the same or the trust agreement, or the trustee therefor, shall have the right to apply in any appropriate judicial proceeding to any court of competent jurisdiction, for the appointment of a receiver of the project, whether or not all bonds shall have been declared due and payable and whether or not such holder or trustee is seeking or has sought to enforce any other right or to exercise any other remedy in connection with such bonds, and upon such application the court may appoint such receiver. 
(c)  Restrictions on receiver. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, any such receiver shall have no power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any assets of whatever kind or character belonging to and useful for the project, and the authority of any such receiver shall be limited to the operation and maintenance of the project in receivership and no court shall have jurisdiction to enter any order or decree requiring or permitting such receiver to sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of any such assets.

The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, and the duties of the city in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions hereof insofar as the same may be applicable; provided, however, that no revenue refunding bonds shall be issued except in exchange for general obligation or revenue bonds to be refunded thereby or in the amount necessary to provide for the payment of matured general obligation or revenue bonds or bonds maturing or redeemable within six months or unmatured general obligation or revenue bonds which can be acquired for retirement, including any redemption premium and accrued interest thereon.

All funds held by any trustee under any trust indenture, executed as hereinabove authorized, shall, upon the final payment of any such revenue bonds or revenue refunding bonds with respect to the project, be paid to the city and may be applied by the city to any public purpose.

The municipal utilities commission may contract to sell power to any other municipality, county or public body at approved rates, and the revenue derived from such sales shall be treated as part of the revenues of the project. 
(1961 Code, § 110; 1947, ch. 339, § 114N)

(d)  Effect. Upon the approval by the municipality of an urban renewal plan or of any modification thereof, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area and the municipality may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms.

Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, the municipality shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality retaining the property; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. The municipality in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that such purchaser or lessee shall be without power to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the municipality until he has completed the construction of any or all improvements which he has obligated himself to construct thereon. Real property acquired by the municipality which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred, shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan. Any contract for such transfer and the urban renewal plan (or such part or parts of such contract or plan as the municipality may determine) may be recorded in the Land Records of the county in which the municipality is situated in such manner as to afford actual or constructive notice thereof. 
(b)  Disposal. The municipality may dispose of real property in an urban renewal area to private persons only under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures as it shall prescribe or as hereinafter provided in this sub-section. The municipality may, by public notice by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community (not less than sixty days prior to the execution of any contract to sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property and prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance with respect thereto under the provisions of this section) invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate an urban renewal area, or any part thereof. Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that proposals shall be made by those interested within a specified period of not less than sixty days after the first date of publication of said notice, and that such further information as is available may be obtained at such office as shall be designated in said notice. The municipality shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out, and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease or other transfer of any real property acquired by the municipality in the urban renewal area. The municipality may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this sub-heading. Thereafter, the municipality may execute and deliver contracts, deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such transfers. 
(c)  Exception. The municipality may temporarily operate and maintain real property acquired by it in an urban renewal area for or in connection with an urban renewal project pending the disposition of the property as authorized in this sub-heading, without regard to the provisions of sub-section (a) above, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the urban renewal plan. 
(d)  Execution. Any instrument executed by the municipality and purporting to convey any right, title or interest in any property under this sub-heading shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with the provisions of this sub-heading insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchaser, lessees or transferees of such property is concerned.

Code of Md. art. 31, §§ 9-11].

(d)  Sale. Such bonds may be sold at not less than par at public sales held after notice published prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area in which the municipality is located and in such other medium of publication as the municipality may determine or may be exchanged for other bonds on the basis of par; provided, that such bonds may be sold to the federal government at private sale at not less than par, and, in the event less than all of the authorized principal amount of such bonds is sold to the federal government, the balance may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the municipality of not to exceed the interest cost to the municipality of the portion of the bonds sold to the federal government. 
(e)  Validity. In case any of the public officials of the municipality whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this sub-heading shall cease to be such officials before the delivery of such bond or, in the event any such officials shall have become such after the date of issue thereof, said bonds shall nevertheless be valid and binding obligations of said municipality in accordance with their terms. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this subheading shall be fully negotiable. 
(f)  Suit. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability bond issued under this sub-heading or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the municipality in connection with an urban renewal project, as herein defined, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this sub-heading.

State Law reference- Penalties for ordinance violations, Ann. Code of Md. art. 23A, § 3. 
Sec. 1-9. - Municipal infractions. 
(a)  Declaration as infraction; fine. The council may, by official act, declare the violation of any sections of this Code or other ordinances of the city to be an infraction, and, for each such violation, a specific fine shall be set. Such fine shall never exceed $100.00 for any single, initial violation, or $200.00 for each repeat or continuing violation, and each day the violations continue shall constitute a separate offense. The fine shall be expressed as a discrete amount rather than being expressed in terms of a maximum or minimum amount. The authority to declare infractions and set fines shall not be delegated by the council to any other administrative or legislative body. 
(b)  Enforcement. The commissioners of the city may by resolution designate those persons capable of issuing citations for municipal infractions. 
(c)  Issuance of citation. The code enforcement officials authorized by the council to enforce this Code may deliver by personal service or certified mail with return receipt restricted delivery a citation to any person alleged to have committed an infraction. A copy of such citation shall be retained by the city and shall bear the certification of the enforcing official attesting to the truth of the matter set forth in the citation. The citation shall contain at a minimum the following information: 
(1)  The name and address of the person charged; 
(2)  The nature of the infraction; 
(3)  The location and time that the infraction occurred or was observed; 
(4)  The amount of the infraction fine assessed; 
(5)  The manner, location and time in which the fine may be paid to the city; and 
(6)  The right of the accused to stand trial for the infraction. 
(d)  Payment of fine. The fine for an infraction shall be as specified in the law violated. The fine is payable by the recipient of the citation to the city within 20 calendar days of receipt of the citation. 
(e)  No formal hearing by city. The city shall not conduct any formal hearing for those persons in receipt of a citation of infraction. Any offender so cited shall either pay the fine as indicated in the citation or elect to stand trial for the offense. This provision shall not prevent an offender from requesting, either personally or through an attorney, additional information concerning the infraction. 
(f)  Election to stand trial. A person receiving a citation for an infraction may elect to stand trial for the offense by notifying the city in writing of his intention of standing trial. The notice shall be given at least five days prior to the date of payment as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice of the intention to stand trial, the city shall forward to the district court having venue thereof a copy of the notice from the person who received the citation indicating his intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the citation, the district court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial date. All fines, penalties or forfeitures collected by the district court for violations of infractions shall be remitted to the general fund of the city. 
(g)  Failure to pay fine. If a person receiving a citation for an infraction fails to pay the fine for such infraction by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a notice of his intention to stand trial for the offense, a formal notice of the infraction shall be sent to the offender's last known address. If the citation has not been satisfied within 15 days from the date of the notice, he shall be liable for an additional fine not to exceed twice the original fine. If after 35 days the citation has not been satisfied, the city may request adjudication of the case through the district court. The district court shall promptly schedule the case for trial and summon the defendant to appear. 
(h)  Conviction not criminal offense. Conviction of a municipal infraction, whether by the district court or by payment of the fine to the city, is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction. 
(i)  Court proceedings and rights of accused. In any proceeding for a municipal infraction the accused shall have the same rights as for the trial of criminal cases. He shall have the right to cross examine witnesses against him, to testify or introduce evidence in his own behalf and to be represented by an attorney of his own selection and at his own expense. 
(j)  Privilege to waive fine. The city commissioners have the privilege to waive any fine contained in this Code not imposed by any court if it can be established by uncontroverted evidence that the citation for the offense was issued erroneously.

Sec. 4-39A. - Inoperable vehicles. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to prevent the accumulation of inoperable motor vehicles, or parts thereof, in unapproved and inappropriate locations throughout the city of Cambridge, to the extent that they constitute an unsightly, obnoxious and unsanitary condition. The presence of such motor vehicles constitutes a condition detrimental to the general well being of the citizens of the city, and is hereby declared a public nuisance. Therefore, this article is adopted for the preservation of health, safety and general public welfare, by implementing and enforcing adequate regulations concerning inoperable motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers which require property owners, tenants, occupants or lessees to remove the same from their premises. 
(b)  Definitions. For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:

(e)  Notice. The city shall provide 15 days' written notice to the owner of the property where the vehicle is located. Such notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall be mailed to the last known address of such owner, as shown on the current real estate assessment records/books of the city. Such notice shall state that the owner shall have 15 days to license or repair the vehicle so as to bring it into compliance with this section, or to remove the vehicle. Said 15-day notice period shall begin on the date of actual receipt by the owner, or five days after the date of mailing such notice, whichever shall first occur. A copy of such notice shall be posted on the vehicle and a copy shall be sent to the owner of the vehicle, if known to the city. The notice shall also state that the failure of the property owner to respond to the notice shall constitute an admission by the owner that the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer was located on his/her property with his/her permission and therefore, does not constitute an "abandoned vehicle." In the event that the owner of the inoperable vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer cannot be determined by investigation through the state motor vehicle administration or the comparable agency of the state in which such vehicle or trailer is registered, or if same cannot be reasonably ascertained from the inoperable motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer, or if same cannot be reasonably obtained from the owner of the property from which it was removed, then no such additional notice to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer shall be required. 
(f)  Removal by city. The city is authorized to remove such inoperable vehicle. In the event that the owner of the property fails to remove the inoperable vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer within the 15 days' notice period, the city, through its agents or employees, may remove any such inoperable vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer pursuant to the provisions of this section, and may dispose of such vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer as follows:

The notice shall also state that the owner and secured party shall have 21 days to reclaim the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer, by payment of all towing, preservation and storage fees and charges resulting from the removal. The notice shall also state that the failure of the owner or secured party to exercise its right to reclaim the vehicle shall constitute a waiver of their right, title and interest in the vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer, and shall constitute their consent to the disposal of the vehicle either as scrap metal or to its sale at public auction, in the sole discretion of the city. 
(2)  For vehicles, trailer or semi-trailers which are not titled in the name of the property owner and which have remained illegally on private property for more than 48 hours without the consent of the property owner, then such vehicles, trailers or semi-trailers shall constitute "abandoned vehicles" and shall be removed pursuant to section 4-39 hereinabove, and pursuant to sections 25-201, et seq., as amended, of the Transportation Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. 
(g)  Disposal of vehicle. In the event that inoperable vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is not an "abandoned vehicle" as defined hereinabove, then the city, in its sole and absolute discretion may elect to sell the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer at public auction, or may elect to dispose of the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer, as scrap metal. 
(h)  Assessment of costs. The cost of any such removal and disposal shall be chargeable to the owner of the inoperable motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer, or the owner of the property from which such inoperable motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer was removed, and may be collected by the city in the same manner as taxes and levies are collected, and shall constitute a lien on the property in the same manner and effect as taxes, and shall accrue interest at the same rate as taxes. Any amount which may be realized by the city from the sale of any such inoperable motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer, shall be applied to such costs. 
(i)  Failure to respond. The failure of the property owner to respond to the notice from the city shall constitute an admission by the property owner that the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer was on his or her property with his or her permission, and therefore, shall not constitute an "abandoned vehicle." 
(j)  Extension for good cause shown. The owner of the property or vehicle may make application to the housing board of review for an extension of the period for maintaining an inoperable vehicle on property within the city of Cambridge. Such extension may only be granted for good cause shown, and shall not exceed a period of one year. 
(k)  Penalty for violation.

(b)  Portable on-demand storage units (PODs) regulated. 
(1)  Location. Portable on-demand storage units ("PODs") are prohibited from being placed on an unpaved area in the front yard of a property, without the prior written approval of the permitting official, building official or code enforcement officer. PODs kept on-site must be kept in the driveway or paved, off-street surface on the property at the furthest accessible point from the street. Where possible the POD unit shall be placed on a paved surface to the rear or side of the principal structure. When placed on the driveway or paved area in side or rear yard, POD units shall be located at least three feet from any property line, and at least ten feet from any occupied residential structure. In no event shall PODs be placed in the street or on any public sidewalk or right-of-way, without the prior written approval of the permitting official and the authorized member of the Cambridge Police Department. Only one POD may be placed on a residential property at any given time, subject to exceptions set forth below for natural disasters. 
In the event that the only practical location for the placement of the POD is in the street, or on a public sidewalk or right-of-way, then in such event, the proposed placement of the POD must be reviewed and approved by the Cambridge Police Department and the permitting official to assure that said placement does not jeopardize the public's health and safety. 
(2)  Time limitation. A POD unit may remain on a property for 60 days in one twelve-month period, with up to one 30-day extension pursuant to the permitting provisions set forth below for good cause shown. Absent an emergency condition or natural disaster as set forth in item no. (3) below, in no event shall a POD remain on a property in excess of 90 days in one 12-month period. 
(3)  Use during natural disaster. The above restrictions notwithstanding, when the principal structure on the property has been made uninhabitable as a result of a natural disaster for which a local state of emergency declaration has been issued, or a fire or other damaging event beyond the control of the owner, one or more POD units may be used for on-site storage. The authorization for such use shall be dependent upon issuance of a building permit for the reconstruction/repair of the principal structure(s) on the property and shall expire upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the principal structure(s) or 12 months from the date of the event that caused damage to the structure, whichever first occurs. For good cause shown, and to recognize extenuating circumstances, the permitting official, building official or code enforcement officer may extend the authorization for as much as an additional 12-month period or until a certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever first occurs. 
(4)  Advertising prohibited. Advertising is prohibited on a POD unit, with the exception of the name and telephone number of the unit's supplier, which shall be required.

(6)  Condition of PODs. All PODs shall be maintained in good condition and repair, and shall not have holes, breaks, tears, or large areas of rust on the exterior of the POD. The area around the POD shall be kept free of debris and litter, and shall be in strict compliance with the weed and rubbish provisions of the city's property maintenance code; 
(7)  Use limited to property. A POD shall only be used to contain and store items and material generated at the location where the POD is placed for the residential property being serviced. In no event shall debris and/or material generated off-site be deposited or stored in any POD. 
(8)  Enforcement. Upon reasonable notice to the permit applicant, the code enforcement officer may inspect the POD to ensure compliance with the requirements and conditions of this section. 
(c)  Permit required. 
(1)  A permit shall be required for all portable on-demand storage units. The permit shall be valid for a period of 60 days, and may be renewed for one 30-day extension for good cause shown. The permit shall be obtained from the department of public works, and the permit fee shall be set by the Commissioners of Cambridge by resolution. The permit shall be displayed in a weather proof material on the dumpster or POD. Extensions of the permits are permitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) above, based upon a showing of good cause. Permits issued as a result of a natural disaster or other qualifying emergency shall comply with the requirements set forth in item (b)(3) above. 
(2)  Exemption. In the event that the property owner obtains a building permit for renovations or new construction to a residential structure, and the building permit application includes a request for permission to locate a POD on the property for storage as part of the construction or renovation project, then a separate POD permit shall not be required, and the placement of the POD on the property shall be covered by the building permit. In such event, the building permit shall specify that the time limitations set forth in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) above apply to the POD. 
(d)  Abatement. Any POD not in compliance with this section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated by the city at the property owner's or responsible person's expense. Abatement shall, at the city's option, include the removal and/or emptying of the POD as the case may be. All costs incurred by the city in the abatement shall constitute a lien on the subject property and shall be collected the same as real property taxes by the city.

Acceptable standards and specifications for soil erosion and sediment control are available in the office of the Dorchester Soil Conservation District. Where developments are involved (commercial, industrial or two or more residential units) the developer shall include in the application a grading and an erosion and sediment control plan designed by a professional engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect or architect registered in the state, and a certificate that all land clearing, construction and development will be done pursuant to such plan. 
(Code 1972, § 25.05) 
Sec. 7-8. - Required approvals; applicability of state law. 
    Proposed steps and procedures to control erosion and sedimentation must be approved prior to issuance of a grading permit. Erosion and sediment control plans, when required, must be approved by the Dorchester Soil Conservation District. Issuance of a city grading permit does not eliminate the requirement for obtaining a department of natural resources permit, if required under conditions specified by state law. 
(Code 1972, § 25.06; Ord. No. 443, § 1; Ord. No. 473, § 1) 
Sec. 7-9. - Suspension upon failure to correct noncompliance. 
    In the event that work performed does not conform to the provisions of the permit, or to the approved plans and specifications, or to any written instructions of the department of public works, a written notice to comply shall be given to the permittee. Such notice shall set forth the nature of the corrections required and the time within which corrections shall be made. Failure to comply with such written notice shall be deemed justification for suspension of the permit, which will require that all work stop except that necessary for correction of the violation. Upon correction of the violation, the permittee may apply for removal of the suspension. 
(Code 1972, § 25.07) 
Sec. 7-10. - Cancellation. 
    After suspension of a grading permit, if corrections required are not completed within the time period specified as provided in section 7-9, the permit shall be cancelled. In the event of cancellation, any bonds or cash deposits posted with the city shall be used for work on the site to prevent erosion. 
(Code 1972, § 25.08; Ord. No. 443, § 1) 
Sec. 7-11. - Bond. 
    When deemed necessary by the department of public works, the permittee shall be required, prior to the issuance of a grading permit, to post with the city a cash deposit, performance bond from an approved corporate surety, or other collateral acceptable to the city. The amount posted shall be sufficient to guarantee that, in the event that provisions of the permit are not completed satisfactorily, or the permit is cancelled, the site can be restored to a condition meeting the minimum requirements of the standards for erosion control. 
(Code 1972, § 25.09) 
Sec. 7-12. - Term. 
    A grading permit shall be valid for a period of one year from date of issuance and during the continuation of work in conformity with an approved plan. Upon request and adequate justification of a permittee, the department of public works may grant a six-month extension of validity.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1045, adopted March 9, 2015, repealed Art. III and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. III, §§ 7-31-7-40, 7-61-7-68, 7-91-7-102, 7-131-7-137, 7-161-7-164, 7-191-7-193, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1012, Exh. A, 5-9-11. 
Cross reference- Development standards for drainage and floodprone areas, § 17-13. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 7-31. - Findings. 
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the City of Cambridge. Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Structures that are inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses. 
    The City of Cambridge, by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on January 16, 1981. As of that date, the initial effective date of the City of Cambridge Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.1), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-32. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Maryland General Assembly, Md. Code Ann., Land Use Article, Title 4, has established as policy of the state that the orderly development and use of land and structures requires comprehensive regulation through the implementation of planning and zoning control, and that planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by local government in order to, among other purposes, secure the public safety, promote health and general welfare, and promote the conservation of natural resources. Therefore, the Council of the City of Cambridge does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.2), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(A)  Protect human life, health and welfare; 
(B)  Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future; 
(C)  Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal systems; 
(D)  Maintain natural drainage; 
(E)  Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding; 
(F)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(G)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(H)  Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(I)  Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions; 
(J)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood-prone areas; 
(K)  Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of floodplains are maintained; 
(L)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains; 
(M)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(N)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 44 CFR Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.3), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-34. - Areas to which these regulations apply. 
    These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Cambridge, and identified in section 7-35. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.4), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-35. - Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and BFEs. 
(a)  For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is the Flood Insurance Study for Dorchester County, Maryland and Incorporated Areas dated March 16, 2015, or the most recent revision thereof, and the accompanying flood insurance rate map(s), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs. The FIS and FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at the department of public works. 
(b)  Where field surveyed topography or digital topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard on the FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area. 
(c)  To establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard areas that do not have such elevations shown on the FIRM, the floodplain administrator may provide the best available data for base flood elevations, may require the applicant to obtain available information from federal, state or other sources, or may require the applicant to establish special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations as set forth in section 7-63, section 7-64, and section 7-65 of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.5), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-36. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing regulations and ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, building codes, or any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.6), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-37. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be: 
(a)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and, 
(c)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
    Notes referencing publications of the Federal Emergency Management Agency refer to the most recent edition of those publications, are intended only as guidance, and do not bind or alter the authority of the floodplain administrator to interpret and apply these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.7), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-38. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. 
    These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Cambridge, any officer or employee thereof, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.8), 3-9-15) 
Sec. 7-39. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 1045, Exh. A(1.9), 3-9-15) 
Secs. 7-40-7-50. - Reserved.

(1)  Upon placement of the lowest floor and prior to further vertical construction; and 
(2)  Prior to the final inspection and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
    Alteration of a watercourse: For the purpose of these regulations, alteration of a watercourse includes, but is not limited to widening, deepening or relocating the channel, including excavation or filling of the channel. Alteration of a watercourse does not include construction of a road, bridge, culvert, dam, or in-stream pond unless the channel is proposed to be realigned or relocated as part of such construction. 
    Area of shallow flooding: A designated zone AO on the flood insurance rate map with a one percent annual chance or greater of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident; such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base building: The building to which an addition is being added. This term is used in provisions relating to additions. 
    Base flood: The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; the base flood also is referred to as the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood. 
    Base flood elevation: The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum specified on the community's flood insurance rate map. In areas of shallow flooding, the base flood elevation is the highest adjacent natural grade elevation plus the depth number specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map, or at least four feet if the depth number is not specified. 
    Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

    Coastal A zone: An area within a special flood hazard area, landward of a coastal high hazard area (V Zone) or landward of a shoreline without a mapped coastal high hazard area, in which the principal source(s) of flooding are astronomical tides and storm surges, and in which, during base flood conditions, the potential exists for breaking waves with heights greater than or equal to one and one-half feet. The inland limit of the Coastal A Zone may be delineated on FIRMs as the Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiWMA). 
    Coastal high hazard area: An area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms. Coastal high hazard areas also are referred to as "V Zones" and are designated on FIRMs as zones VE or V1-30. 
    Community: A political subdivision of the State of Maryland (county, city or town) that has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations within its jurisdictional boundaries. 
    Critical and essential facilities: Buildings and other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind, snow or earthquakes. [Note: See Maryland Building Performance Standards, Sec. 1602 and Table 1604.5.] Critical and essential facilities typically include hospitals, fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, facilities that handle or store hazardous materials, and similar facilities. 
    Declaration of land restriction (nonconversion agreement): A form signed by the owner to agree not to convert or modify in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the permit and these regulations, certain enclosures below the lowest floor of elevated buildings and certain accessory structures. The form requires the owner to record it on the property deed to inform future owners of the restrictions. 
    Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, placement of manufactured homes, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevation certificate: FEMA form on which surveyed elevations and other data pertinent to a property and a building are identified and which shall be completed by a licensed professional land surveyor or a licensed professional engineer, as specified by the floodplain administrator. When used to document the height above grade of buildings in special flood hazard areas for which base flood elevation data are not available, the Elevation Certificate shall be completed in accordance with the instructions issued by FEMA. [Note: FEMA Form 086-0-33 and instructions are available online at http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1383.] 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor: An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure that is located below an elevated building, is surrounded by walls on all sides, and is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations. Also see "lowest floor." 
    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The federal agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Flood or flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood damage-resistant materials: Any construction material that is capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact with floodwaters without sustaining any damage that requires more than cosmetic repair. [Note: See NFIP Technical Bulletin #2, "Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements."] 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated special flood hazard areas to indicate the magnitude and nature of flood hazards, to designate applicable flood zones, and to delineate floodways, if applicable. FIRMs that have been prepared in digital format or converted to digital format are referred to as digital FIRMs (DFIRM). 
    Flood insurance study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information, and the water surface elevations. 
    Flood opening: A flood opening (non-engineered) is an opening that is used to meet the prescriptive requirement of one square inch of net open area for every square foot of enclosed area. An engineered flood opening is an opening that is designed and certified by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect as meeting certain performance characteristics, including providing automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; this certification requirement may be satisfied by an individual certification for a specific structure or issuance of an Evaluation Report by the ICC Evaluation Service, Inc. [Note: See NFIP Technical Bulletin #1, "Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures."] 
    Flood protection elevation: The base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. Freeboard is a factor of safety that compensates for uncertainty in factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, climate change, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed. 
    Flood protection setback: A distance measured perpendicular to the top of bank of a watercourse that delineates an area to be left undisturbed to minimize future flood damage and to recognize the potential for bank erosion. Along nontidal waters of the state, the flood protection setback is: 
(1)  One hundred feet, if the watercourse has special flood hazard areas shown on the FIRM, except where the setback extends beyond the boundary of the flood hazard area; or 
(2)  Fifty feet, if the watercourse does not have special flood hazard areas shown on the FIRM. 
    Flood zone: A designation for areas that are shown on flood insurance rate maps: 
(1)  Zone A: Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood; base flood elevations are not determined. 
(2)  Zone AE and zone A1-30: Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood; base flood elevations are determined; floodways may or may not be determined. In areas subject to tidal flooding, the limit of moderate wave action may or may not be delineated. 
(3)  Zone AH and zone AO: Areas of shallow flooding, with flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding or sheet flow on sloping terrain), with or without BFEs or designated flood depths. 
(4)  Zone B and zone X (shaded): Areas subject to inundation by the 0.2-percent annual chance (500-year) flood; areas subject to the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected from the base flood by levees. 
(5)  Zone C and zone X (unshaded): Areas outside of zones designated A, AE, A1-30, AO, VE, V1-30, B, and X (shaded). 
(6)  Zone VE and zone V1-30: Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood and subject to high velocity wave action (also see coastal high hazard area). 
    Floodplain: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flood" or "flooding"). 
    Floodproofing or floodproofed: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to buildings or structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents, such that the buildings or structures are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. [Note: State regulations at COMAR 26.17.04.11(B)(7) do not allow new nonresidential buildings in nontidal waters of the State to be floodproofed.] 
    Floodproofing certificate: FEMA form that is to be completed, signed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect to certify that the design of floodproofing and proposed methods of construction are in accordance with the applicable requirements of section 7-105(b) of these regulations. [Note: FEMA Form 086-0-34 is available online at http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1600.] 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. When shown on a FIRM, the floodway is referred to as the "designated floodway." 
    Free-of-obstruction: A term that describes open foundations (pilings, columns, or piers) without attached elements or foundation components that would obstruct the free passage of floodwaters and waves beneath structures that are elevated on such foundations. [Note: See NFIP Technical Bulletin #5, "Free-of-Obstruction Requirements."] 
    Functionally dependent use: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water; the term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed foundation of a structure. 
    Historic structure: Any structure that is: 
(1)  Individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on the Maryland Register of Historic Places; or 
(4)  Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by the City of Cambridge whose historic preservation program has been certified by the Maryland Historical Trust or the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses: Analyses performed by a licensed professional engineer, in accordance with standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Maryland Department of the Environment (Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways) and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC): A letter of map change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, that amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study. Letters of map change include: 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA): An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes that a specific property or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F), is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A conditional letter of map revision based on fill (CLOMR-F) is a determination that a parcel of land or proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is placed on the parcel as proposed or the structure is built as proposed. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA, to revise the effective FIRM. 
    Licensed: As used in these regulations, licensed refers to professionals who are authorized to practice in the State of Maryland by issuance of licenses by the Maryland Board of Architects, Maryland Board of Professional Engineers, Maryland Board of Professional Land Surveyors, and the Maryland Real Estate Appraisers and Home Inspectors Commission. 
    Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA): Inland limit of the area affected by waves greater than one and one-half feet during the base flood. Base flood conditions between the VE zone and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less severe than those in the VE zone. 
    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a building or structure; the floor of an enclosure below the lowest floor is not the lowest floor provided the enclosure is constructed in accordance with these regulations. The lowest floor of a manufactured home is the bottom of the lowest horizontal supporting member (longitudinal chassis frame beam). 
    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Market value: The price at which a property will change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither party being under compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. For the purposes of these regulations, the market value of a building is determined by a licensed real estate appraiser or the most recent, full phased-in assessment value of the building (improvement) determined by the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation. 
    Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE): A principal department of the State of Maryland that is charged with, among other responsibilities, the coordination of the National Flood Insurance Program in Maryland (NFIP State Coordinator) and the administration of regulatory programs for development and construction that occur within the waters of the State, including nontidal wetlands, nontidal waters and floodplains, and state and private tidal wetlands (tidal wetlands). Unless otherwise specified, "MDE" refers to the department's wetlands and waterways program. 
    Mixed-use structure: Any structure that is used or intended for use for a mixture of nonresidential and residential uses in the same structure. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The program authorized by the U.S. Congress in 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001-4129. The NFIP makes flood insurance coverage available in communities that agree to adopt and enforce minimum regulatory requirements for development in areas prone to flooding (see definition of "special flood hazard area"). 
    New construction: Structures, including additions and improvements, and the placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced on or after January 16, 1981, the initial effective date of the City of Cambridge Flood Insurance Rate Map, including any subsequent improvements, alterations, modifications, and additions to such structures. 
    NFIP State Coordinator: See Maryland Department of the Environment. 
    Nontidal waters of the State: See "Waters of the State." As used in these regulations, "nontidal waters of the State" refers to any stream or body of water within the State that is subject to State regulation, including the "100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters." COMAR 26.17.04 states that "the landward boundaries of any tidal waters shall be deemed coterminous with the wetlands boundary maps adopted pursuant to Environment Article, § 16-301, Annotated Code of Maryland." Therefore, the boundary between the tidal and nontidal waters of the State is the tidal wetlands boundary. 
    Person: An individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and local governments and agencies. 
    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA): The land in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in flood insurance studies and on flood insurance rate maps as zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood maps that are identified in section 7-35. 
    Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure: That which is built or constructed; specifically, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a building or structure whereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the damage occurred. Also used as "substantially damaged" structures. [see section 7-86] [Note: See "Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference" (FEMA P-758).] 
    Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the start of construction of the improvement. The term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building or structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to submission of an application for a permit and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
[Note: See "substantial improvement/substantial damage desk reference" (FEMA P-758).] 
    Temporary structure: A structure installed, used, or erected for a period of less than 180 days. 
    Variance: A grant of relief from the strict application of one or more requirements of these regulations. 
    Violation: Any construction or development in a special flood hazard area that is being performed without an issued permit.

Sec. 7-63. - Use and interpretation of FIRMs. 
    The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(a)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations; 
(2)  Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(b)  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
(c)  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations. 
(d)  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
(e)  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
(1)  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, if the preliminary flood hazard data is more restrictive than the effective data, it shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to section 7-35(c) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
(3)  Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations, floodplain or floodway boundaries exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.

No such permit shall be issued until the requirements of these regulations have been met. 
(b)  In addition to the permits required in paragraph (a), applicants for permits in nontidal waters of the state are advised to contact MDE. Unless waived by MDE, pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations 26.17.04, Construction on Nontidal Waters and Floodplains, MDE regulates the "100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters," also referred to as nontidal waters of the state. To determine the 100-year frequency floodplain, hydrologic calculations are based on the ultimate development of the watershed, assuming existing zoning. The resulting flood hazard areas delineated using the results of such calculations may be different than the special flood hazard areas established in section 7-35 of these regulations. A permit from the City of Cambridge is still required in addition to any state requirements. 
(c)  A permit is valid provided the actual start of work is within 180 days of the date of permit issuance. Requests for extensions shall be submitted in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. The floodplain administrator may grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each and provided there has been no amendment or revision to the basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and BFEs set forth in section 7-35.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 7-231. - Purpose and authority. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased stormwater runoff. The goal is to manage stormwater by using environmental site design (ESD) to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) to maintain after development, as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics, and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation, and local flooding, and use appropriate structural best management practices (BMPs) only when necessary. This will restore, enhance, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of streams, minimize damage to public and private property, and reduce the impacts of land development. 
    The provisions of this article, pursuant to the Ann. Code of Md. art. Environment, tit. 4, subtit. 2, 2009 replacement volume, are adopted under the authority of the City Code of Cambridge, Maryland and shall apply to all development occurring within the incorporated area of the City of Cambridge. The application of this article and provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute. 
    The provisions of this article may not be construed to affect the requirements for a project located in an Intensely Developed Area of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area to comply with the ten percent Pollution Reduction Requirement under COMAR 27.01.02.03 D(3). 
    The city department of public works shall be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this article. This article applies to all new and redevelopment projects that have not received approval for final plans by June 1, 2010.

Sec. 7-271. - Minimum control requirements. 
(a)  The minimum control requirements established in this section and the design manual are as follows: 
(1)  Planning techniques, nonstructural practices, and design methods specified in the design manual shall be used to implement ESD to the MEP. The use of ESD planning techniques and treatment practices must be exhausted before any structural BMP is implemented. Stormwater management plans for development projects subject to this article shall be designed using ESD sizing criteria, recharge volume, water quality volume, and channel protection storage volume criteria according to the design manual. The MEP standard is met when channel stability is maintained, predevelopment groundwater recharge is replicated, nonpoint source pollution is minimized, and structural stormwater management practices are used only if determined to be absolutely necessary. 
(2)  Control of both the two-year and ten-year frequency storm event is required by the department of public works. Control of higher frequency storm events than the two-year and ten-year frequency storm may be required if the department of public works determines that additional stormwater management is necessary because historical flooding problems exist and downstream floodplain development and conveyance system design cannot be controlled. 
(3)  The department of public works may require more than the minimum control requirements specified in this article if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant or if flooding, stream channel erosion, or water quality problems exist downstream from a proposed project. 
(4)  The stormwater management plan shall demonstrate that the 100-year frequency storm will not damage stormwater management facilities and will be safely conveyed to downstream areas. 
(b)  Alternative minimum control requirements may be adopted subject to administration approval. The administration shall require a demonstration that alternative requirements will implement ESD to the MEP and control flood damages, accelerated stream erosion, water quality, and sedimentation. Comprehensive watershed studies may also be required. 
(c)  Stormwater management and development plans where applicable, shall be consistent with adopted and approved watershed management plans or flood management plans as approved by the state department of the environment in accordance with the Flood Hazard Management Act of 1976.

This section sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the city, and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The objectives of this section are: 
(a)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(b)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving water or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(c)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system; and 
(d)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal wastewater system. 
This section provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established in this section. 
This section shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city POTW.

(b)  Approval of plans; immediate notice of discharge. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this section shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(c)  Written report. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(d)  Notices to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(9)  Upsets. An upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
An upset can be used as an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, provided the industrial user meets certain conditions. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
(a)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause or causes. 
(b)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
(c)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the county within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must follow within five days): a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(10)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (B)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(1)  Notice. 
(a)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(b)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(2)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(a)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless: 
(i)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
(ii)  There was not a feasible alternative to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. The condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(iii)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (B)(10)(1) of this section. 
(b)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (B)(10)(2)(a) of this section. 
(C)  Fees. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the city's wastewater disposal system for the implementation of the program established in this chapter. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the city's schedule of charges and fees.

(b)  Any significant industrial user of the POTW shall submit, at a minimum, semiannual reports (on dates specified by the POTW in the permit) to the POTW. This report shall include but not be limited to information on flows, pollutant concentrations, spills, etc. In addition, other nonsignificant industrial users may also be required to submit reports. 
(c)  Upon request of the city, any discharger or potential discharger of industrial wastes into the POTW may be required to submit plans, reports, questionnaires, notices or analytical data to evaluate waste discharge characteristics and ensure compliance with this section. These may include baseline monitoring reports, compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, compliance schedule progress reports, violation reports, and notice of slug loadings, upset or bypass, or any other reporting requirement specified in 40 CFR 403.12. 
(d)  All industries subject to categorical pretreatment standards must provide the certification statement required by 40 CFR 403.12, as follows: 
"I certify under penalty of Law that this Document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(e)  All reports and certification statements submitted by users of the POTW shall be signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection (A)(2)(c) of this section. 
(f)  All analyses, including sampling techniques, submitted in support of any application, report, evidence or required by any permit or order shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 136, and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136, does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator (as defined in 40 CFR 136) determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the administrator. 
(g)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
(i)  The city performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(ii)  The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(h)  Notification of hazardous discharge. 
(1)  The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this section. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this section shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e). 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (D)(3)(h)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under subsection (D)(3)(h) of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(4)  Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(5)  Inspection and sampling. City, state and federal officials shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this section is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, state and federal officials ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. City, state and federal officials shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with the user's security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(6)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this section and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this section. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
(7)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user, or would violate federal security standards. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this section, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, the state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to the general public by the city without a ten-day notification period being given to the user. 
(8)  Records. 
1.  Users shall retain and make available upon request of an authorized representative of the city, the state or the EPA all records required to be collected by the user pursuant to this article. 
2.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years after their collection. This period shall be extended during any litigation concerning compliance with this section or permit conditions. 
(E)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Harmful contributions. The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, causes interference to the POTW, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge, and receipt of compensation for the additional POTW recovery costs associated with the treatment and disposal of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of occurrence. 
(2)  Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions of this section or applicable state and federal regulations is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of subsection (E) of this section: 
(a)  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(b)  Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(c)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspections or monitoring; or 
(d)  Violation of conditions of the permit. 
(3)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this section, the wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained in this section, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. 
(4)  Injunctive relief. 
(a)  Generally. The city engineer may bring an action for an injunction against any person who violates any provision of this section or any rules, regulation, order or permit adopted or issued under this section. 
(b)  Findings of city engineer. In any action for an injunction under this section, any finding of the city engineer, after hearing, is prima facie evidence of each fact the city engineer determines. 
(c)  Grounds. On a showing that any person is violating or is about the violate this section or any rule, regulation, order or permit adopted or issued by city engineer, the court shall grant an injunction without requiring a showing of a lack of an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  Emergency injunctions. If an emergency arises due to imminent danger to the public health or welfare or imminent danger to the environment, the city engineer may sue for an immediate injunction to stop any pollution or other activity that is causing the danger. 
(5)  Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this section, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the circuit court of the county. 
(6)  Publication of significant noncompliance. The city shall publish annually in the Daily Banner a list of industrial users which at any time during the previous 12 months were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. For the purpose of this provision, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(a)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter. 
(b)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(c)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public). 
(d)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(B), to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
(e)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order as to starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance. 
(f)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
(g)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(h)  Any other violation or group of violations which the POTW determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(7)  Compliance schedules. If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required for an industrial user to comply with any provisions of this section or a state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement the city may require the industrial user to submit for approval a schedule specifying the shortest timeframe for the industry to achieve compliance. This schedule will contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of the additional pretreatment to bring the industrial user into compliance.

Sec. 16-21. - Sidewalk construction generally. 
(a)  Authority to require construction. Whenever the commissioners deem it to be in the public interest and for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, they may require sidewalks to be constructed on properties where curb and gutter exist. The city shall determine, through inspection by the department of public works, code enforcement division, areas of the city where a substantial percentage of the sidewalks are in need of replacement (as established in the current property maintenance code). In the area so designated, the city shall notify all property owners by certified mail, that a sidewalk replacement project will be taking place on their property within 90 days of the notice.

a.  The date of a public hearing on the matter. 
b.  The locations of the proposed replacement project. 
c.  A preliminary cost estimate for each property owner's part of the proposed project. 
d.  A timeline showing the schedule of the work, including: 
1.  Date of the inspection.

The cost of the work shall be divided by the total area of work in square feet to arrive at a unit cost, and distributed over the affected property owners proportionally to the actual square footage installed, to within one-tenth of a square foot. 
This calculation shall apply only to sidewalks parallel to the public street that connect with sidewalks at the adjoining properties. Any sidewalks constructed from the public way to the house, or any other sidewalks on the property are not eligible for funding under this program, and the cost therefore shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner.

a.  Payment in full. The city shall accept payment in the full amount of the pro-rated cost without an interest charge within 90 days of the invoice date. 
b.  Payment via tax lien. After 90 days, the city shall attach a lien in the amount of the pro-rated cost to the city property tax bill, which will then be paid by the property owner over a period of one to five years, as determined by the commissioners of the city, with an interest charged at the rate of one-half the legal rate charged for delinquent real property taxes. 
c.  The commissioners may institute legislation to modify the terms of the lien for the benefit of owners who can demonstrate a bona find hardship and/or income eligibility based on an index of the area median income as determined by HUD. 
d.  Funds, including interest collected, recovered by the revolving loan fund shall be returned to that fund for the express purpose of continuing and expanding this program for the benefit of the citizens of the city. 
e.  Property owners may, at their option, undertake the installation of the replacement sidewalks on their property at their own expense, with all work subject to the usual permit fees and inspection for compliance with the all applicable codes. 
These options shall be published and provided to the property owners in the project area as part of the official notice outlined above.

conditions of the subject property, a particular hardship to the owner would
result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations were to be carried out. The alleged hardship shall relate to the
land, not to personal circumstances.

3. The alleged hardship has not been created by the present owner or any
previous owners of the property.
4. The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this Ordinance and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which
the property is located.

property, substantially increase congestion of public streets, increase the
danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.

the minimum variance necessary to afford relief.

impact fish, wildlife, or plant habitat.
8. The granting of the variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of

his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the

use shall be approved by the Zoning Official in the absence of such
conformance.

nonconforming use, but shall be, without further action, considered a
conforming one.
D. Standards

preponderance of evidence of record, that the proposed use submitted for a special
exception would have adverse impacts at its proposed particular location which
would be above and beyond those inherently associated with the proposed use
irrespective of its location with the zoning district. In making its decision, the Board
shall make findings with respect to each of the following standards:
25
1. The establishment, maintenance and operation of the special exception at its
proposed location will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, or general welfare.
2. The special exception at its proposed location shall be such that it will be
harmonious in character as well as appropriate in appearance with and will
not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the
neighborhood for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish
and impair property values within the neighborhood.
3. The establishment of the special exception at its proposed location will not
impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of
surrounding properties.
4. Adequate utilities, public water and sewer facilities, access streets, drainage
and all necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
5. The special exception shall be such that pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle
traffic associated with such use at its proposed location will not be hazardous
to or unduly conflict with the existing and anticipated traffic in the
neighborhood.

regulations of the district in which it is located and to the special
requirements that may be established for the specific use.
7. The proposed use at its proposed location conforms to the Comprehensive
Plan.
E. Burden of Proof

include the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion
on all questions of fact that are to be determined by the Board of Appeals.
F. Conditions and Restrictions
The Board of Appeals, in approving a special exception, may impose such conditions,
safeguards, and restrictions upon the proposed use, as it may deem necessary in the
public interest to secure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and to
promote implementation of the Comprehensive Plan.

application is submitted indicating the section of this Ordinance under which
the special exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is
requested.

The application shall be completed and shall be accompanied by information
which will be necessary to evaluate a given proposed category or use. The
Zoning Official, upon receipt of a properly completed and documented
26
application, shall refer the application along with pertinent evaluation
material to the Board.

Planning Commission has reviewed the application and has first made a
recommendation to the Board.

lessee or contract purchaser. A lessee or contract purchaser must file with
the application, a copy of the contract or some form of written statement
which indicates endorsement of the application by the property owner.
H. Processing and Public Hearing Requirement
The Board of Appeals shall process all applications for special exception in
accordance with the provisions and public hearing requirements provided in § 2.3
of this Ordinance.
I. Termination or Revocation
1. Unless a time limit is specified for a special exception, the same shall be valid
for an indefinite period of time, except that, if the use or activity should cease
for any reason for a continuous period of one year, the special exception shall
automatically terminate without notice. The approval of a new special
exception shall be required prior to any subsequent reinstatement of the use.
2. A special exception shall be revocable on the order of the Board of Appeals at
any time because of the failure of the owner or operator of the use covered
by the exception to observe all requirements of law with respect to the
maintenance and conduct of the use and all conditions in connection with the
exception that were designated in issuing the same.
Before revoking any special exception, however, the Board of Appeals shall
give the holder thereof at least ten days written notice of violation. If within
ten days, the exception holder so requests, the Board of Appeals shall hold a
hearing on the revocation of the exception, giving the applicant written
notice of the hearing date.

other remedy prescribed by law or by this Ordinance with respect to
violations.

§ 2.4 Nonconforming Lots, Structures, and Uses
29
§ 2.4.1 Intent of the Regulations
A. Purpose and Intent
1. It is the intent of this Ordinance not to encourage the survival of
nonconformities. Such uses are incompatible with permitted uses in the
zoning districts involved.
2. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone.
B. Extension of Nonconformities Prohibited
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises, or by the
addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited in the zone involved.
C. Impact on Ongoing Lawful Construction
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently carried on.
§ 2.4 Nonconformities
§ 2.4.1 Intent of the Regulations
A. Nonconformities Defined; Purpose and Intent
1. As used in this Ordinance, a nonconformity means and refers to a lot, use, or
structure lawfully existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance or any
amendment thereto and, because of the passage of such Ordinance or amendment,
no longer conforms to one (1) or more of the regulations applicable to such lot,
use, or structure.
2. Nonconformities are discouraged and shall only be continued or maintained in
accordance with the terms of this section, which are intended to protect the rights
of legally existing nonconformities without permitting expansion, extension, or
enlargement thereof or the addition of uses or structures prohibited under this
Ordinance. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary,
nonconformities are strongly encouraged to conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance so as to preserve the integrity hereof and the Citys character.
B. Impact on Ongoing Lawful Construction
30
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change
in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction
was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of passage or amendment of this Ordinance
and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on.
§ 2.4.2 Nonconforming Lots, Structures, and Uses
A. Nonconforming Lots of Record
1. In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
undeveloped nonconforming single lot of record as of the effective date of
passage or amendment of this Ordinance, provided that such lot is not of
continuous frontage with other lots under common ownership. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width
or both that are generally applicable in the zoning district, provided that yard
dimensions shall conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such
lot is located. Any variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Appeals.
2. On any commercially zoned property in which commercial/mixed use buildings
are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
Ordinance, a commercial/mixed use building may be erected on any undeveloped
nonconforming single lot of record as of the effective date of passage or
amendment of this Ordinance, provided that such lot is not of continuous frontage
with other lots under common ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally
applicable in the zoning district, provided that yard dimensions shall conform to
the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is located. Any variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Appeals.
3. If two (2) or more nonconforming lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage under common ownership are of record as of the
effective date of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the
lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this
Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold
which does not meet lot width or area requirements established by this Ordinance,
nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with
width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
B. Nonconforming Uses of Land
Where, as of the effective date of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful use
of land exists that is rendered a nonconformity under the terms hereof as enacted or
amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
31
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied as of the effective date of passage
or amendment of this Ordinance.
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use as of the effective date of
passage or amendment of this Ordinance.
3. If any such nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than
ninety (90) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which such land is located.
C. Nonconforming Structures
Where, as of the effective date of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful
structure exists that could not be built under the terms hereof as enacted or amended by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the
structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued subject to § 2.4.2(E),
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its
nonconformity. For purposes of this Ordinance, renovation of a structure which
maintains the existing building envelope and does not extend the structure beyond
the existing building envelope does not constitute an increase in nonconformity of
the structure.
2. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than
twenty-five (25) percent of its appraised valuation at time of destruction as
determined by the appraised valuation, which shall mean either the appraised
valuation for property tax purposes as determined by the Maryland Department of
Assessments and Taxation or the valuation determined by a professionally
recognized property appraiser, it shall not be reconstructed as a nonconforming
structure, except as may be authorized by the Planning Commission under §§
5.1.2(A)(3) and/or 2.4.2(E)(4).
3. Should such structure be moved, regardless of the reason or distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Nonconforming Uses of Structures
Where, as of the effective date of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful use
of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists that would not be
allowed in the zoning district under the terms hereof as enacted or amended, such use
may be continued subject to § 2.4.2(E), so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
32
1. The alteration of a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be subject to
the same standards set forth herein applicable to nonconforming structures.
2. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that
were manifestly arranged or designed for such use as of the effective date of
passage or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
3. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a structure, or
structure and premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming
use, provided that the Board of Appeals shall find that the proposed
nonconformity is equally appropriate or more appropriate in the zoning district
than the existing nonconformity. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals
may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
4. Any structure, or structure and premises in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the zoning district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.
5. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate such
nonconforming status of the land, except as otherwise provided herein.
E. Repairs, Improvements, and Routine Maintenance of Nonconforming Structures
1. Repairs, improvements, and routine maintenance of nonconforming structures and
premises upon which a nonconforming structure is located are permitted as set
forth herein.
2. On any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use, ordinary
repairs or renovations may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive
months, provided that the structures density and building envelope (i.e. bedroom
count and typology) as it existed as of the date of passage or amendment of this
Ordinance shall not be increased.
3. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe
by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
4. Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, a nonconforming
multi-family structure in the Residential district that is damaged or destroyed by
accidental or natural causes or other causes beyond the property owners control
may be replaced in kind provided that the construction commences within one (1)
year of the structure being damaged or destroyed and is completed within a timely
manner as deemed appropriate by the Building Official. The Zoning Official may
33
extend the one (1) year deadline for commencement of construction upon
demonstration that, due to circumstances beyond the property owners control,
construction could not commence within one (1) year of the structure being
damaged or destroyed and the property owner providing a date certain upon
which construction shall commence.
F. Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconformities
1. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued for a consecutive period of ninety (90) days, it shall
be considered abandoned.
2. If a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of the nonconforming use for a consecutive period of ninety (90)
days shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.
3. For any nonconforming residential apartment uses, the following shall be
sufficient, but not necessarily the only criteria, for determining whether such use
has been abandoned or discontinued:
a. To the extent required by the City, failure to maintain with the City a
current record of the rental status of each nonconforming apartment or to
timely pay when due any fee imposed by the City associated therewith; or
b. The removal or decommissioning of the electric or water meters on the
property that are necessary to serve apartment units on such property.
4. For nonconformities other than the foregoing, if the nonconformity is: (a)
discontinued for a consecutive period of twelve (12) months; or (b) discontinued
for any period of time and accompanied by the property owners express written
intention to discontinue the same, the property may thereafter be used only in
conformity with this Ordinance unless the Planning Commission approves the
issuance of a zoning permit to allow the nonconformitys continuance. This
permit may be issued if the Planning Commission finds that eliminating the
nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without
adding additional land to the lot where the nonconformity is maintained or
moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The zoning
permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be brought into compliance
with this Ordinance.
5. For purposes of determining whether to approve a nonconformitys continuance,
all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to
be considered as a whole. For example, with respect to a nonconforming use, the
failure to rent one (1) apartment unit in a multiple unit nonconforming apartment
building for a consecutive period of ninety (90) days shall not result in a loss of
the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment use of
the building as a whole is continuously maintained and not discontinued or
abandoned as set forth herein.
34
§ 2.4.3 PWCD and PWRD Developments, Approved
Development projects which were lawfully approved by the City and have vested under the
laws of Maryland, under the provisions of the PWCD and PWRD prior to adoption of this
Ordinance, shall lawfully continue under the terms, conditions, and limitations of their
approved PWCD or PWRD plans and shall be entitled to the rights and privileges contained
in those plans, except for those areas zoned Resource Conservation, which areas shall
adhere in full to the regulations of this Ordinance.

other action authorized by this Ordinance to insure compliance with or to prevent
violation of its provisions.
C. Questions of Interpretation
All questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the
Zoning Official and such questions shall be presented to the Board of Appeals only
on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Official.
§ 2.5.2 Penalties for Violation
A. Violation Constitutes a Municipal Infraction
1. A violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply
with any of its requirements shall constitute a municipal infraction, subject to
a fine of one hundred dollars ($100) for the first violation. The fine for each
subsequent violation shall be two hundred dollars ($200). Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
2. The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and
any architect, engineer, builder, contractor, agent, or other person, who
commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be
found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided.
35
B. Other Lawful Action as Necessary
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City may enforce this
Ordinance by civil action for declaratory judgment and/or injunction, in addition or
as an alternative to citing the violator for a municipal infraction. In the case of a civil
action for declaratory judgment and/or injunction, the City may recover its legal
fees and court costs from the violator.
C. Permit Revocation
1. A zoning, occupancy, or building permit may be revoked by the Zoning
Official if the permit recipient fails to develop, use, or maintain the property
in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements of this chapter, or
any additional requirements lawfully imposed as a condition of a permit.
2. Before revoking a permit, the Zoning Official shall give the permit recipient
15 days notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient
of the reasons for the revocation and his right to an informal hearing with the
Zoning Official on the allegations. If the permit is revoked, the Zoning Official
shall provide a written statement of the decision and the reasons therefor.
3. No person may continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner
authorized by any permit after such permit has been revoked.
§ 2.5.3 Schedule of Fees, Charges, and Expenses
A. Schedule of Fees
1. The Mayor and City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, fees in lieu,
charges, and expenses, and a collection procedure, for zoning permits,

final.
A. Concept Stage
The purpose of the concept stage is to provide the Planning Commission with the
opportunity to informally review a development proposal prior to the substantial
commitment of time and expense on the part of the applicant in preparing a site
plan.
1. No application for Category 1 Site Plan approval shall be accepted by the City

might have substantial impact on the physical, economic, or social
environment, the Planning Commission may hold more than one meeting on
the concept plan.
5. For all Category 1 Site Plans submitted for review, the Zoning Official shall:
a. Submit verifiable notice to the applicant at least seven days before the
day of the meeting to discuss the concept site plan, and
b. Submit verifiable notice to all owners of property adjoining and
immediately across the street from the subject property. Such written
notice shall state the date, time, place, and subject matter of the
meeting to discuss the concept site plan, and the name of the
applicant. Such notice shall be sent not less than seven days before the
day of the meeting.
c. The Planning Commission may provide for expanded public
notification of its deliberations of site plans at its discretion.

Category 1 Site Plans.
39
1. Preliminary site plans meeting the submittal requirements of § 3.1.5 shall be
submitted to the Zoning Official who shall review the plans for compliance
with these regulations and the requirements for preliminary site plans and
shall transmit said plans to the Planning Commission with his or her
comments for review.
2. The Planning Commission shall examine the proposed development with
respect to the traffic and circulation patterns and safety (internal and
external), utilities, drainage, community facilities (existing or proposed),
surrounding development (existing or future), the preservation of trees and
historic sites, protection of natural environmental features and processes,
provision for open space, street lighting, recreational needs, safety of
residents and neighbors, landscaping, architecture, compatibility with
building, site and design standards, and, in general, with the objective of
ensuring a durable, harmonious, and appropriate use of the land.
3. The Planning Commission shall take action to approve, approve with
conditions, disapprove, or table pending further investigation and/or receipt

site plans as set forth in § 3.1.6 and that any required design and construction
standards are specifically and accurately addressed, to ensure that all conditions of
the Planning Commissions approval are specifically and accurately met, and to
finalize any and all necessary formal agreements related to the project, which may
include public works agreements and easement agreements, among others.
1. Final site plan approval shall be granted prior to the commencement of any
development activity.
40
2. Final site plans shall be submitted to the Zoning Official who shall review the
plans for compliance with these regulations and the conditions, if any, of
Planning Commission approval.

documentation of such approvals provided to the Zoning Official, he/she and
the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall each sign to certify the site
plan indicating completion of review and approval by the City and to certify
that conditions, if any, of site plan approval have been met. The applicant
shall submit all local, county, state and/or federal approvals as may be
required. No zoning permit shall be issued until this approval has been given.
4. When a public works agreement is required, final plan approval shall not be
certified as provided in paragraph 3 above until the Planning Commission
has first reviewed that public works agreement. The public works agreement
shall be recorded in the Land Records of Dorchester County and such
recordation information shall be placed on the recorded site plan(s) to which
it pertains.
D. Project Built to Plan for Occupancy Permit
1. The Zoning Official shall assure that the project is completed in conformance
with the approved site plan before certifying the same. Upon such
certification, a use and occupancy permit will be issued.

subdivisions (subdivisions resulting in four or fewer lots), lot line adjustments, and
conversions of existing deeded lots to parcels. The Zoning Official may submit a minor
subdivision to the Planning Commission for review and approval under the procedures of §
3.3 upon his/her finding that the subdivision warrants more extensive public review due to
potential impacts to the neighborhood, area infrastructure or environmental quality.
A. Acceptance of Plan for Administrative Review
No application for administrative review shall be accepted by the City until:
1. A plan in compliance with § 3.1.8 is submitted for review to the Zoning
Official.
2. Any required plan review fees have been paid.
B. Action by Zoning Official
Plans requiring administrative review shall be submitted to the Zoning Official who
shall review the plans for compliance with these regulations.
45
1. If the Zoning Official finds that such plans meet the intent of this Ordinance
and are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, then he/she shall affix
his/her signature on the plan(s) certifying approval.
2. If the Zoning Official finds that the plan does not meet the intent of this
Ordinance and/or is not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the
Citys adopted building and site design standards, then he/she shall deny
approval and transmit that decision in writing to the applicant.
3. The Zoning Official shall not take action to approve or deny a plan requiring
administrative review until the following has occurred:
a. The Zoning Official has reviewed the plan and determined that it is
complete.
b. The applicant has submitted any impact studies that may be required
by § 3.3 of this Ordinance and has obtained City approval of such
required studies.

§ 3.2 Subdivision Review and Approval
§ 3.2.1 Subdivision Review and Approval
A. Purpose
Subdivision plats prepared and approved in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be required to assist in the review of applications for land
subdivision and to assure compliance with all applicable requirements.
B. Applicability
No land in a subdivision shall be sold or offered for sale nor shall a building permit
be issued for a structure thereon until a final plat of such subdivision has been
recorded per this Ordinance and the improvements required in connection with
such subdivision have either been constructed or guaranteed per this Ordinance.
C. Administration
46
1. Minor subdivisions, lot line adjustments, and conversions of existing deeded
lots to parcels shall be reviewed according to procedures set forth in § 3.1.7
of this Ordinance.
2. Major subdivisions shall be reviewed and approved according to the
procedures set forth in § 3.2.2 below.
3. Subdivision of land within the Historic District shall be referred to the HPC
by the Planning Commission for comment.
§ 3.2.2 Subdivision Processing Procedures
There shall be three stages in the review and approval of a major subdivision: concept,
preliminary, and final plat.
A. Concept Stage
The purpose of the concept stage is to provide the Planning Commission with the
opportunity to informally review a subdivision proposal prior to the substantial
commitment of time and expense on the part of the applicant in preparing a
preliminary plat.
1. No application for subdivision approval shall be accepted by the City until:
a. A concept subdivision plat meeting the content submittal
requirements of § 3.1.4 of this Ordinance is submitted for review by
the City.
b. Any required concept plat review fees have been paid.
c. The steps for concept subdivision plat review as established by the
Planning Commission are completed.
2. Within 30 days of receiving a subdivision concept plat, the Zoning Official
shall review the concept for completeness and inform the applicant and
Planning Commission of his/her findings.
3. The Zoning Official shall refer the concept plat to the appropriate individuals
or agencies for review and/or comment prior to submitting it to the Planning
Commission.
4. The applicant shall attend a meeting with the Zoning Official prior to
submitting the concept plat to the Planning Commission. The purpose of the
meeting shall be to provide the City with an opportunity to address issues or
concerns, identify any impact studies that may be required, and provide
direction to the applicant on the scope of such studies.
5. The Planning Commission shall hold at least one meeting on the concept plat
to receive an informational briefing on the plat and the anticipated issues and
impacts related thereto. The Planning Commission shall take no action to
approve or deny a concept plat. Should the Planning Commission determine
that the development project represented by the concept plat may have
substantial impact on the physical, economic, or social environment, the
Planning Commission may hold more than one meeting on the concept plat.
47
6. For all subdivision plats submitted for review, the Zoning Official shall:
a. Submit written notice to the applicant by first class mail, such to be
postmarked at least seven days before the day of the Planning
Commission meeting to discuss the concept site plan, and
b. Submit written notice to all owners of property adjoining and
immediately across the street from the subject property. Such written
notice shall state the date, time, place, and subject matter of the
meeting to discuss the concept plat, and the name of the applicant.
Such notice shall be sent by first class mail and be postmarked not less
than seven days before the day of the meeting.
c. The Planning Commission may provide for expanded public
notification of its deliberations of subdivision plans at its discretion.
B. Preliminary Stage
The purpose of the preliminary subdivision review stage is to provide a basis for the
Planning Commission to take formal approving action with respect to the proposed
subdivision in order to minimize changes and revisions that might otherwise be
necessary on the final subdivision plan. The Planning Commission shall review and
take action to approve, approve with conditions, or deny all preliminary subdivision
plats.
1. Preliminary subdivision plats meeting the submittal requirements set forth
in
§ 3.1.5 of this Ordinance shall be submitted to the Zoning Official who shall
review the plats for compliance with these regulations and the requirements
for preliminary plats and shall transmit said plats to the Planning
Commission with his or her comments for review. Applications found to be
incomplete shall be returned to the applicant.
2. The Planning Commission shall examine the proposed subdivision with
respect to the vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic and circulation
patterns and safety (internal and external), utilities, stormwater
management, community facilities (existing or proposed), surrounding
development (existing or future), the preservation of trees and historic sites,
protection of natural environmental features and processes, provision for
open space, street lighting, recreational needs, safety of residents and
neighbors, landscaping, architecture, compatibility with building site and
design standards, and, in general, with the objective of ensuring a durable,
harmonious, and appropriate use of the land and consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan.
3. The Planning Commission shall take action to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny approval, but shall take no action until the following has
occurred:
a. The Zoning Official has reviewed the subdivision plat and determined
that it is complete and submitted findings to that effect in writing to
the Planning Commission.
48
b. The applicant has submitted any impact studies that may be required
and has obtained City approval of such studies, where required.
c. Comments from appropriate agencies and individuals have been
requested and sufficient time has been provided for such agencies and
individuals to provide comments.
d. The applicant has paid all appropriate preliminary subdivision review
and application fees to the City.
4. No public hearing shall be required, but may be called at the option of the
Planning Commission.
5. Planning Commission Action: The Planning Commission shall act for
approval, conditional approval with conditions noted, postponement, or
disapproval. Reasons for all actions shall be stated in the decision of the
Planning Commission. The following actions shall have the meanings so
stated:
a. Approval means that the developer is authorized to proceed with the
preparation of a final plat. Preliminary plat approval grants an
applicant one (1) year within which to submit a final plat.
b. Conditional Approval means that applicant may proceed with a final
plat, but only after the preliminary plat has been corrected to reflect
all conditions placed on the plat by the action of the Planning
Commission. Actual approval shall not be made until the Planning
Commission finds that all such conditions have been satisfied.
c. Postponement means Planning Commission action is delayed for
definite reasons, which the Planning Commission shall record in
writing.
d. Disapproval means disapproval of the plat. For any further action, the
developer must file a new application meeting the submittal
requirements along with the required filing fees.
C. Final Stage
The final subdivision plan shall consist of a drawing intended for recordation,
incorporating those changes or additions required by the Planning Commission in
its approval of the Preliminary Subdivision Plat.
1. Final subdivision plats shall be submitted to the Zoning Official who shall
review the plats for compliance with these regulations and the conditions, if
any, of Planning Commission approval. If specified conditions or stipulations
of the preliminary plat approval are not met in revised plans, the Zoning
Official shall return the plat to the applicant.
2. When all review and approvals have been completed and documentation of
such approvals provided to the Zoning Official, he/she and the Chairperson
of the Planning Commission, shall each sign the final plat to indicate
completion of review and approval by the City and to certify that conditions,
if any, of plat approval have been met and that the applicant has submitted
49
all local, county, state and/or federal approvals as may be required. No
permit shall be issued until this approval has been given.
3. When a public works agreement is required, the Zoning Official and
Chairperson of the Planning Commission may not certify final plat approval
until the Planning Commission has reviewed that public works agreement.
The public works agreement shall be recorded in the Land Records of
Dorchester County and such recordation information shall be placed on the
recorded plat(s) to which it pertains.
§ 3.2.3 Expiration and Extension of Preliminary Plat Approval
A. Grant of Extension
1. A preliminary plat approval grants the applicant one year in which the
applicant shall submit the final plat.
2. Before expiration of the approval, the Planning Commission may grant an
extension for just cause, with extension periods no greater than one year at a
time. The applicant shall request an extension at least 30 days prior to the
deadline date for submittal of a final plat.
3. In connection with a request for extension, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following:
a. Whether a lawful change in the neighborhood of the property has
made the subdivision, as originally approved, incompatible with
neighboring properties or presented impacts to neighboring
properties and infrastructure not foreseen before such land use
change occurred; and
b. Whether a change in the street and highway plan or the plan for any
public facilities and/or services, trails or pathways, or the projected
impact of area development on streets, highways, water and sewer
and other facilities has made the subdivision, as originally proposed,
problematic; and
c. Any change in zoning and/or subdivision regulations; and
d. Any changes in the Citys Comprehensive Plan.
e. The Planning Commission may require that an impact study as
provided in § 3.3 of this Ordinance be completed in connection with a
request for an extension.
B. Changes May Be Required
In conjunction with an approved extension, the Planning Commission may require
that changes in the plat be made upon finding that time has necessitated changes for
the benefit of the public health, safety, and welfare.
C. Expiration of Extension Period
50
Upon expiration of any extension period approved herein, the plat shall be deemed
disapproved by the Planning Commission.
D. Approved Plats Exempted from Regulatory Changes
Any approved preliminary plat or any plat continued for further study by the
Planning Commission shall be exempted from changes in the regulations governing
subdivisions for a period of two years from the date of approval of the preliminary
plat. Exemptions from changes in the subdivision regulations shall not be extended,
even if the preliminary plat is extended as provided above.

Element in particular.
2. The existing and future availability of public facilities and services to meet
the demands of development that would be allowed under the recommended
zoning of the annexation property.
3. The viability and practicality of public and/or private plans to extend,
enlarge, or otherwise make existing City facilities and services, and other
utilities and services, available to the annexation property.

§ 3.4.2 Annexation Concept Development Plan
A. Concept Plan Required
1. A concept development plan, prepared to standards established by the
Planning Commission, shall be required to assist the City in the review of any
proposed annexation wherein the City is not the initiating party.
2. Where applicable, a concept development plan shall be officially introduced
by the City Council along with the annexation resolution, it shall be made
part of the official record of the public hearing on the annexation and it shall
be recorded in the land records of Dorchester County by the applicant upon
annexation.
B. Exceptions to Required Concept Development Plan
The following two conditions must be found by the City Council to be met, if an
annexation is to proceed without a concept development plan:
1. The eventual use of the property and its impact on its neighborhood is
constrained by its relatively small size, and the proposed zoning is fully
consistent and compatible with the surrounding land use pattern; and
2. Adequate safeguards can be set forth in the text of an annexation agreement
to ensure that the Citys interests are protected and advanced.
C. Future Development to Conform to Concept Development Plan
1. When a site plan or subdivision plat is proposed for a property which was
the subject of an annexation concept development plan, the plan or plat shall
substantively conform to the annexation concept development plan.
2. The Zoning Official or Planning Commission shall not accept a site plan or
subdivision plat for review that does not substantively conform to its concept
development plan as set forth in paragraph D of this section, except as
provided in paragraph 3 below.

review that does not substantively conform with a required annexation plan
if each of the following conditions is met:
54
a. The Planning Commission first holds a public hearing wherein the
applicant shall be asked to explain the proposed deviations; and
b. The Planning Commission finds that the proposed deviations are not
inconsistent with the Citys Comprehensive Plan; and
c. The proposed deviations would not materially impact the ability of
the City to provide public water and sanitary sewer services or other
services and facilities; and
d. The proposed deviations would not require a change in the zoning
district to implement.
4. The Planning Commission is under no obligation to approve a plan or plat
that deviates from an annexation concept development plan but, provided
the conditions in paragraph 3 above are met, it shall review the plan or plat
under the standard processing procedures provided for in this Article.
D. Standards for Substantial Conformance
The Planning Commission shall apply the standards in this paragraph below in
determining if a site plan or subdivision plat is in substantial conformance with its
annexation concept plan, if applicable. To be found in substantial conformance, a
development plan shall not:
1. Propose a land use, a pattern of residential densities, or an arrangement of
land uses other than that shown on the concept development plan.
2. Propose a different type of housing or commercial development which would
in the judgment of the Planning Commission (1) materially increase the
impact to area infrastructure and public services or (2) not serve the same
public need contemplated by concept development plan (e.g., need for
affordable housing, senior housing, etc.).
3. Result in the reduction of more than three percent or one-half (½) acre
(whichever is the lesser) of the land area collectively planned to be set aside
for natural area preservation, buffering, forest conservation, common open
space, and/or recreation.
4. Increase the number of dwelling units by more than five percent for any
residential project of 100 units or fewer, or more than three percent for any
residential project of more than 100 dwelling units.
5. Increase the square footage of non-residential building space in a manner
which would in the judgment of the Planning Commission materially increase
the impact to the natural environment or materially intensify the impact to
area infrastructure and/or public services or affect the ability of public
service providers to adequately serve the proposed development.
6. Increase the amount of impervious surface area by more than five percent for
any project less than 40 acres in size or by more than three percent for any
project larger than 40 acres.
55
7. Materially change the arrangement of streets, sidewalks, and trails, the
general location of intersection(s), and the proposed access/circulation plan
for the site.
8. Change in any material way the extent, scale, provision, or timing of any offsite
infrastructure project required or contemplated by the concept
development plan or annexation agreement if applicable.

District as described in § 4.4, the Historic Area Overlay District described in § 4.5,
58
the Floodplain Overlay District described in § 4.6 and the Critical Area District
described in Article 8 of this Ordinance.
B. Purposes of Zoning Districts
The purposes of the individual standard zoning districts and the manner in which
they are to be applied are as follows.
1. Resource Conservation: The Resource Conservation (RC) district is applied
to areas of the City that have natural, scenic, recreational, or other
environmental and open space benefits to the community. District
regulations are intended to protect naturally sensitive environmental and
scenic areas, provide locations for the establishment of recreational, cultural,
scientific, institutional uses whose development and use will have negligible
impacts to the environment, and establish a permanent greenbelt around the
City as recommended in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
2. Institutional: The Institutional (I) district is applied to publicly-owned
institutional uses that comprise large land areas in the City (located outside
of the Downtown/Waterfront Development District) including public school
sites and the airport.
3. Neighborhood Conservation: The Neighborhood Conservation districts
(NC-1,
NC-2, NC-3, and NC-4) are applied to residential neighborhoods that predate
the adoption of City zoning regulations and exhibit primarily single-family
residential character. The intent is to maintain the character of
neighborhoods including the setting for important historic and cultural
resources. The district regulations are also intended to establish reasonable
conditions for the continuation of non-residential uses that pre-date City
zoning and to allow other non-residential uses under strict guidelines and
upon special review. There shall be four NC districts each corresponding to
the unique settlement patterns therein. These districts permit and encourage
minor infill development but generally all proposed new dwellings shall be
single-family detached units.
4. Residential: The Residential (R) district is applied to areas of the City
intended to be maintained as residential neighborhoods and to areas which
may develop in the future as residential neighborhoods. The district
regulations are intended to promote and sustain healthy, stable, and
harmonious residential neighborhoods, to bring about a pattern of street and
lot layout that is reflective of traditional building practices in Cambridge.
5. Downtown/Waterfront Development: The Downtown/Waterfront
Development (DW) district is applied to the mixed-use center of Cambridge.
The district regulations are intended to promote compatibility in building
form, a broad mixture of compatible land use types arranged in ways that
foster efficient use of land and a walkable community. The uses permitted in
this district and the special regulations pertaining to development are set
forth separately in § 4.4 of this Ordinance.
59
6. Corridor Mixed-Use: The Corridor Mixed-Use (CMU) district is applied to
areas of the City located generally along U.S. Route 50 to promote the
efficient and harmonious development of land for commercial use while also
accommodating high density residential developments located within
walking distance of shopping, employment, and recreational activities. A
secondary objective is to promote the retrofit of existing shopping centers
into mixed-use centers that can be readily accessed by transit, biking, and
walking.
7. General Commercial: The General Commercial district (GC) is applied to
areas of the City to accommodate a variety of commercial uses including in
areas that may benefit from orientation to the highway and access to regional
transportation.
8. Industrial: The Industrial district (IND) is applied to areas proposed for
industrial, especially light industrial, uses. The district regulations are
intended to promote the retention and expansion of existing industrial uses
and the general intensification of light industrial uses within the district.
9. Open Space: The Open Space district (OS) is applied to areas proposed to
remain primarily in open, undeveloped, and natural resource uses, until the
year 2030 or later provided a land use change is recommended through
adoption of a new Comprehensive Plan.
10. Maritime Resort: The Maritime Resort district (MR) is applied to
accommodate the development and continuation of resort uses and ancillary
supporting uses including residential.
§ 4.2.2 Land Uses by District
Table 1 lists land uses allowed in each zoning district, except for the
Downtown/Waterfront Development district (see Table 2 in § 4.3 of this Ordinance for
uses allowed in the DW district). If a use is not listed or does not fall within any of the

1. The purpose of the Downtown/Waterfront District regulations is to promote
development and redevelopment and to promote compatibility in building
form, a broad mixture of compatible land use types arranged in ways that
foster efficient use of land, and a walkable community.
To achieve these purposes the district is divided into subdistricts. The
subdistricts and their purposes are as follows:
a. Core (DW-CR): This subdistrict is applied to the historic center of the
City. The regulations are intended to protect and sustain the historic
pattern of densely spaced buildings located close to the street with
multiple floors housing commercial and civic activities and upper floor
residential uses, and to promote development patterns that reinforce
this pattern.
b. General (DW-GN): This subdistrict is applied to areas beyond the
Downtown Core where greater development density and a mix of uses
are desirable. The regulations are intended to promote overall
redevelopment at densities and in patterns that encourage walking and
cycling.
c. Center (DW-CN): The subdistrict is applied along Pine and
Washington Streets. The regulations are intended to promote a
neighborhood center of commercial activity, appropriately scaled to
nearby residential areas.
d. Neighborhood (DW-N): This subdistrict is applied to intact
residential areas within the Downtown/Waterfront Development
District. The regulations are intended to conserve residential patterns
and promote infill development that is compatible in form with the
residential patterns within these areas.
e. Gateway (DW-GT): This subdistrict is applied to properties that front
Maryland Avenue. The regulations are intended to protect the integrity
of the historic built environment while allowing a mix of compatible
land use activities.
f. Civic (DW-Civic): This subdistrict is applied to key large properties in
public use which are proposed to remain in public institutional,
governmental, or recreational use.
B. Applicability
These provisions shall apply within the Downtown/Waterfront District shown
on the official Zoning Map of Cambridge and, where applicable, the specific
regulations of this Section shall apply within the separate subdistricts the
boundaries of which are shown on the Official Zoning Map.

duly notified, to take the corrective action(s) specified in the final notice, within the time
allotted, the HPC may request that the Zoning Official institute any of the remedies and
penalties provided by law for said violations. The above procedures do not preclude the
Zoning Official from pursuing other remedies independent of the HPC as may be required to
remedy a zoning violation in the Historic Area Overlay District.
125
§ 4.5.7 Violations
Any person(s) who violate(s) the provisions of this section by willfully performing or
allowing to be performed any work without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness,

§ 4.6 Floodplain Overlay District
§ 4.6.1 Purpose and Authority
A. The purposes of this Part are to protect human life and health, minimize property
damage, encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize future damage,
protect individuals from unwittingly buying land subject to flood hazards, and to
protect water supply, sanitary sewage disposal, and nature drainage. The
prevention of unwise development in areas subject to flooding will reduce financial
127
burdens to the community and the State, and will prevent future displacement and
suffering of its residents. This protection is achieved through the review of all
activities proposed within identified flood plains and by the issuance of permits for
those activities that comply with the objectives of this chapter.
B. Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural
functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows,
maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat
for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic
quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state.
Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated
wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced.
C. This Part provides a unified, comprehensive approach to floodplain management
which addresses these natural floodplain functions and the Federal and State
programs concerned with floodplain management. These programs are: the national
Flood Insurance Program (44 CRF 59-79); the States Waterway Construction
Permit Program for nontidal floodplains; the States Tidal and Nontidal Wetlands
Permit Programs; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Section 10 and 404 Permit
Programs; and the States Coastal Zone Management Program. Decisions to alter
floodplains, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of
careful planning processes, which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.
§ 4.6.2 Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection provided by this Part is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience and scientific methods of
study. Floods of greater magnitude may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This Part does not imply that flooding will not occur outside of the
delineated floodplain zone, nor that permitted development and land uses within the
floodplain will be free of flooding and associated flood damage. This Part does not create
liability on the part of the community, any officer, or employee thereof for any damage
which may result from reliance on this Part.
§ 4.6.3 Applicability
A. Any development within the floodplain zone of the City of Cambridge must obtain a
permit. A permit shall not be issued nor a variance granted for any new
development in the floodplain zone, except that existing buildings may be
substantially improved, provided that:
1. The improvement is within the footprint of the existing building; and
2. It complies with the design and elevation criteria of this Part.
B. The regulatory floodplain shall be those areas of the City of Cambridge subject to the
100-year flood and delineated on the most recent revision of the Flood Insurance
Rate Map and described in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the Federal
128
Emergency Management Agency. Without prior approval from FEMA, no other data
will be used to enforce floodplain management regulations.
§ 4.6.4 Definitions for This Part Only
Accessory Structure  a detached structure on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure, the use of which is incidental to the principal structure (e.g., a shed or
detached garage).

§ 4.6.5 Development Standards
A. Residential Structures
1. All substantially improved residential structures shall have the lowest floor
elevated to or above the Flood Protection Elevation. Basements are not
permitted. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a registered
surveyor or professional engineer in the Elevation Certificate, after the
lowest floor is in place.
2. Enclosures below the Flood Protection Elevation must be constructed with
water equalizing vents to meet the specifications of Section 216.
3. Improvements in tidal floodplains which are less than substantial shall be
constructed to minimize damage during flooding and shall be elevated to the
greatest extent possible.
B. Nonresidential Structures
1. All substantially improved nonresidential structures shall either be elevated
as set forth above for residential structures or shall be floodproofed. State
regulations do not allow basements or the floodproofing option for new
nonresidential structures in nontidal floodplains.
2. Floodproofing designs must insure that areas below the Flood Protection
Elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
3. If the floodproofing option is chosen, a Floodproofing Certificate must be
completed by a registered professional engineer or architect who shall
review the design and specifications and certify that the nonresidential
structure will meet this standard.
C. Accessory Structures and Garages
1. A conditional permit may be issued at the discretion of the local permitting
official when the 300 square foot exemption is exceeded for accessory
structures up to a total size of 600 square feet. In order to qualify, the
131
structures use must be incidental to the primary structure, and it can be
used only for limited storage and parking of vehicles.
D. Specific Requirements
In addition to the requirements outlined in the preceding subsections, the following
specific requirements must be applied.
1. Placement of Buildings and Materials  In general, buildings and accessory
structures should be located entirely out of the floodplain, out of the flood
protection setback, or on land that is least susceptible to flooding. All
structures permitted in the floodplain shall be oriented so as to offer the least
resistance to the flow of floodwaters. Materials which are buoyant,
flammable, explosive, hazardous to health, or which at times of flooding may
be injurious to human, animal, or plant life, shall not be stored below the
Flood Protection Elevation.
2. Enclosures Below Lowest Floor  Buildings which have been elevated and
have fully enclosed areas below the Flood Protection Elevation (other than
basements), as well as garages and accessory structures which are not
elevated, shall be constructed with water equalizing vents which meet or
exceed the following standards:
a. A minimum of two openings on different walls having a total area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade; and
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry
and exit of floodwaters to equalize hydrostatic forces on the walls.
d. Fully enclosed areas below the Flood Protection Elevation shall be
used solely for parking of vehicles, access to the building, or storage.
3. Anchoring  All structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
acceptable engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement during flooding. All air ducts, large pipes, and storage tanks
located below the Flood Protection Elevation shall be firmly anchored to
resist flotation.
§ 4.6.6 Utilities
A. Electric  All electric utilities to the building side of the meter, both interior and
exterior to the building, are regulated by this Part. Distribution panel boxes must be
at least 2 feet above the Flood Protection Elevation. All outlets and electrical
installations, such as heat pumps, air conditioners, water heaters, furnaces,
generators, distribution systems, must be installed at or above the Flood Protection
Elevation.
B. Plumbing  Toilets, sinks, showers, water heaters, pressure tanks, furnaces, and
other permanent plumbing installations must be installed at or above the Flood
Protection Elevation.
132
C. Gas  Gas meters, distribution lines, and gas appliances must be installed at or above
the Flood Protection Elevation.
D. Water Supply and Sanitary Facilities  Water supply distribution and sanitary
disposal collection systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate the
infiltration of flood waters into the systems or discharges from the systems into
flood waters and shall be located and constructed so as to minimize or eliminate
flood damage. On-site sewage disposal systems shall meet these same standards.
§ 4.6.7 Certification Required
A. For residential and nonresidential structures built in the regulatory floodplain areas
at or above the Flood Protection Elevation, the applicant must provide a FEMA
elevation certification that the lowest floor of the structure has been built at or
above the Flood Protection Elevation before the structure may be used or a
certificate of occupancy issued. This certification shall be signed by a registered
surveyor or engineer after a bench mark has been established on the building site.
B. For nonresidential structures floodproofed below the Flood Protection Elevation, a
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify on the official FEMA
floodproofing certificate that the floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand
the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood. Failure of the applicant to provide the Department
with the floodproofing certificate shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. A
record of such certificates indicating the specific elevation in relation to mean sea
level to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
Department of Public Works.
C. For all new and replacement water supply systems, sanitary sewage systems and
on-site waste disposal systems, an applicant shall meet requirements intended to
assure minimization or elimination of impairment, contamination or infiltration into
the systems and discharges from the systems during flooding.
§ 4.6.8 Variances Concerning this Section
A. General Provisions
1. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter. Conditions may be attached
to the variance action, and variance actions must be consistent with sound
floodplain management. Variances may not be issued except as specified
below, nor shall variances be issued for any encroachment in floodways if
any increase in the 100-year flood levels will result.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
133
b. A determination that failure to grant a variance would result in
exceptional hardship (other than economic) to the applicant; and
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local and State laws
or chapters.
3. The variance action shall be the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief. In considering a variance action, comments from the
State coordinating Office of the Water Resources Administration must be
taken into account and maintained with the permit file.
B. Conditions of Variance Requests
1. Variances may not be granted for the following:
a. Placement of fill or any development in the floodway if any increase in
flood levels would result;
b. Placement of fill in the coastal high hazard are for structural support;
or
c. New buildings in the floodway.
2. For any variance issued, a letter shall be sent to the applicant indicating the
terms and conditions of the variance, the increased risk to life and property
in granting the variance, and the increased premium rates for National Flood
Insurance coverage. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the
requirement for recordation of these conditions on the deed or
Memorandum of Land Restriction prior to obtaining a permit and of the need
to secure all necessary permits as conditions for granting a variance. The
Memorandum is described in Articles 3-102 and 3-103 of the Real Property
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
a. The local permitting official shall maintain a record of all variance
actions and the justification for their issuance, as well as all
correspondence. This record must be submitted as a part of the
Biennial Report to FEMA, and be available for periodic review. The
number of variance actions should be kept to a minimum.
C. Functionally Dependent Uses
Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use. A functionally dependent use cannot
perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water. It includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
The variance may be issued only upon sufficient proof of the functional dependence.
The structure must be protected by methods that minimize flood damage up to the
Flood Protection Elevation and must create no additional threats to public safety.
134
This may require methods of wet floodproofing which allow the structure to flood
without significant damage. Methods of floodproofing must not require human
intervention.
135

§ 5.1 Dimensional Requirements
§ 5.2 Architectural Design Requirements in the NC Districts
§ 5.3 Creation of Lots
§ 5.1 Dimensional Requirements
§ 5.1.1 Lot and Bulk Requirements
A. General
The Article establishes the size of lots, the density of land use development and the
location, dimensional and bulk requirements of both principal and accessory
buildings.
B. Purpose
The purposes are to ensure:
1. That the use of property does not infringe on the rights or enjoyment of
adjacent property owners.
2. That new development is compatible with the existing patterns of
development and that it is compact and pedestrian-scaled.
3. That there is adequate light and air for the health and safety of residents,
business operators, and patrons.
4. That the environmental quality of the land and waterways is protected and
that to the greatest extent practical impervious surfaces are minimized in all
new construction.
5. That fire and rescue personnel and equipment will have sufficient access to
the side and rear of structures.
6. The density and intensity of new development is in keeping with the
planning and development of essential municipal facilities and services.
7. Developers and property owners have the flexibility needed to develop
and/or redevelop properties in keeping with the purpose of the district.
C. Requirements by District
136
1. The lot dimensional, density, and bulk requirements set forth in Tables 3 and
4 shall apply to all new construction except as provided below.
a. Specific requirements for new construction in the
Downtown/Waterfront Development District are as provided in §
4.4.5 of this Ordinance with the exception of minimum lots sizes found
in Table 3.
b. Requirements for new construction in the NC-1, NC-2, NC-3, and NC-4
districts are set forth in Tables 5 and 6 of this Section.
2. Requirements for new construction in the Maritime Resort district (MR) shall
be established through the site plan approval process and shall reasonably
relate to any restrictions and standards established in any applicable
approved PWRD plan.
3. Impervious surfaces (surfaces that do not absorb rain, including buildings,
streets, non-pervious driveways, sidewalks, patios, parking areas, and any
other surfaces that are paved or are otherwise impervious to water) shall be
minimized to the maximum extent possible. Notwithstanding the impervious
coverage requirements of Table 3, the City may condition site plan approval
upon the substitution of pervious surfacing materials for proposed or
existing impervious surfaces or may require that driveway and other
proposed impervious surfaces be the smallest necessary to serve their
intended function, or impose other comparable restrictions.

1 the reference to '6/16 means that the minimum setback on one side shall be six feet and the sum of both sides
combined shall be of at least 16 feet.
2 Accessory buildings shall be included in the calculations of maximum building coverage, with the exception of a shed
up to 8 X 10 for existing single family residences, providing the shed meets all other provisions of the UDC including,
but not limited to, critical areas and buffers. A shed may be located in the side yard of a corner lot as long as they are set
back behind the primary residence and located no closer than six (6) feet from the side property line which contains the
side facade of the residence and five (5) feet from the other property line that contains the rear façade of the residence.
§ 5.1.2 Exceptions to Lot and Bulk Requirements
A. Exceptions by District
1. In the Residential district, the front setback shall not vary by more than ten
(10) percent of the average of the existing setbacks for buildings on the same
block face as the proposed building, except as provided in paragraph 3 of this
section.
2. In the Corridor Mixed-Use and Commercial districts, where a side lot line of a
commercial use coincides with a side lot line of another commercial use, the
side lot line may be reduced to zero provided findings are established that
access by emergency personnel to the site would be adequately provided for
and that established fire rating standards are met.
3. For conforming uses of properties in Residential and NC districts, the
Planning Commission may, but is not required to, approve the
redevelopment of properties, including through the teardown and rebuilding
of any structure, with quantitatively the same lot dimension and building
bulk parameters that existed on the site prior to redevelopment or with
standards that are in greater conformance with the dimensional
requirements of Tables 3, 4, 5, or 6 as applicable, provided such structure
146
existed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance. The following procedures
shall govern the review:
a. The Planning Commission may approve a project under the terms of
this provision only upon review of a Category 1 site plan and such
approval shall not require a variance or administrative adjustment.
b. The Planning Commission may approve a project under the terms of
this provision whether or not the property is a nonconforming
structure provided the redevelopment project would not result in the
expansion of a nonconforming structure.
c. The Planning Commission may establish conditions on its approval of
any project approved under the terms of this provision to address any
possible adverse effects of the sites adherence to any pre-existing
dimension and bulk parameters.
d. The Planning Commission may condition its approval on there being
greater conformance to one or more of the dimensional or bulk
requirements of this Ordinance.
e. An applicant for such approval shall adhere to Historic District plan
review procedures if the property is in a Historic District.
B. Allowable Extensions into Yard Areas
Extensions into Yard Area. The following features may extend into required
minimum setback areas but only as qualified below:

eight feet above grade, may extend no more than four feet into any required
yard in any district.
2. Chimneys may extend no more than two feet into any required side yard.
3. Any uncovered and completely unenclosed patio, terrace, or deck, or stairs
with a floor no higher than that of the first floor level of the building may
extend six feet into any required yard, but not nearer to any lot line than a
distance of four feet.
4. In the Residential district, a covered porch may extend six feet into the front
yard.
C. Height
1. The height limits of this Ordinance shall not apply to steeples, spires, belfries
and cupolas not for human occupancy, water towers, equipment for the
operation of a building, chimneys, flag poles, radio towers, masts, aerials and
other similar structures. Antennas are allowed in all districts but shall not be
147
higher above the roof than the distance of the building to the nearest
property line or prescribed boundary.
A. Yards Adjoining More Restrictive District
The Planning Commission or Zoning Official may require that where a lot adjoins the side or
rear yard of a lot in another zoning district, the side or rear yard in the district with the less
restrictive yard requirements shall equal the adjoining side or rear yard of the district with
the more restrictive yard requirements.
§ 5.1.3 Accessory Building/Structure Requirements
A. Location of Accessory Buildings and Structure
The following provisions apply to the location of accessory buildings:
1. Accessory buildings shall not occupy any required front yard or side street
yard; provided, however, that in the case of a corner lot, the accessory
building shall be located in a side yard, with its front façade rear of the the
primary residence.
2. An accessory use or structure may not occupy more than thirty-five percent
(35%) of the area of the rear yard, or in the case of a corner lot, thirty-five
percent (35%) of the area of the side yard rear of the building footprint.
3. Accessory buildings shall not be located closer than six feet from any side
property line or five feet from any rear property line, except in all the
Neighborhood Conservation Districts and in the Downtown Waterfront
Development District Neighborhood Subdistrict where accessory residential
148
buildings and structures may be as close as three feet from the side or rear
property lines.
B. Height of Accessory Building or Structure
1. Except in the Industrial district, where the high point of the roof of any
accessory building exceeds twelve (12) feet in height, the accessory building
shall be set back from the rear lot line an additional two feet for every foot of
height exceeding twelve (12) feet.
2. In all districts except the Industrial district, the maximum height of an
accessory building shall be eighteen (18) feet. In the Industrial district the
maximum allowed height shall be the maximum height of the principal
structure on the lot.
C. Accessory Swimming Pools
Accessory swimming pools may occupy a required rear yard only, provided that
they are not located closer than ten feet to the principal dwelling, side property line,
rear properly lot line, and any other accessory structure located on the premises.
1. A walk space at least three feet wide shall be provided between pool walls
and protective fences or barrier walls.
2. Every in-ground swimming pool shall be protected by a safety fence or
barrier wall which is at least four (4) feet in height and approved by the

height which provides unrestricted access to the pool via steps or unsecured
ladder shall be protected by a fence or barrier wall at least four (4) feet in
height and approved by the Zoning Official. If the ladder, steps or device can
be adequately secured or locked so as to prevent access to the pool, then a
fence or barrier wall shall not be required.
D. Building Permits Required
Any accessory building or square feet in size shall require a permit before
placement.
E. General Requirements
1. When an accessory structure is attached to a principal structure it then
becomes part of that structure and must comply with the setback
requirements for a principal structure in that zoning district.
2. No accessory use or structure shall be permitted on a lot unless the principal
use or structure previously exists or unless construction on the principal
149
structure has started to the point of establishing the permanent foundation

primary rear building facade of the dwelling shall not exceed four (4) feet in height as long
as said fence does not obstruct vision from one side to the other and shall extend to a point
not closer than six (6) feet to the established curb line unless the sidewalk line has been
established, and in such cases the fence shall be extended no closer than six inches to the
established sidewalk line, and, in the event a solid or obstructed vision fence is erected, the
final twenty five (25) feet to the sidewalk shall be no higher than three(3) feet. It is the
intention of this subsection that visibility be maintained near the sidewalk for safety
purposes, and the same shall not be unduly obstructed by planting shrubs, etc.

G. Outside storage shall be screened from the public right of way to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Official. Exception to this requirement may include seasonal retail sales or similar as
determined by the Zoning Official.
H. A permit may be issued for the construction of a security fence for commercial and
industrial properties, upon application.
I. In those cases, where the rear or side of a corner lot abuts upon a residential lot where the
erection of a six-foot-high fence would block the vision of side windows of the adjoining
residence, a fence no higher than four feet may be erected.
J. Location Restrictions  Any fence erected under this Ordinance may be located on the
property line except in the front yard. Any fence erected in a front yard shall be placed at
least one (1) foot back from the front line and/or property line. No front yard fences are
allowed in townhouse projects.
K. Materials and Composition

§ 5.2 Architectural Design Requirements in the NC Districts
and the DWDD Neighborhood Subdistrict.
In the NC-1, NC-2, NC-3, NC-4 districts and the DWDD Neighborhood Subdistrict, the
regulations and procedures set forth in the Architectural Design Minimum Requirements in
the NC Districts and the DWDD Neighborhood Subdistrict shall govern.
§ 5.2.1 Applicability
The Section shall apply to new construction projects within the Neighborhood
Conservation (NC) districts and the DWDD Neighborhood Subdistrict, except for sheds,
garages, decks, pools and routine maintenance of existing structures or structures
undergoing rehabilitation as defined in this section. This section does not apply to projects
under review by the HPC.
§ 5.2.2 Definitions
The following terms have the following meanings for this Section.
One (1) story  a dwelling in which all heated living space is located on the first floor. Any
space allocated to the upper level shall be unfinished, unheated and not habitable.
One and a half (1½) stories  a dwelling in which heated living space is primarily on the
first floor. Second level may be unfinished and unheated.
Two (2) stories  a dwelling in which heated living space is located on a first and second
floor. Second floor has full height exterior walls and is fully finished and heated.
Two and a half (2½) stories  same as above with a third level within the roof system
that may be unfinished and unheated.
153
Three (3) stories  same as above but with a full third floor with full height exterior walls
that is fully finished and heated.
Predominant  A feature is considered predominant when it appears on at least 51% of
the houses surveyed using the Neighborhood Compatibility Worksheet.
New Construction  A new building that is erected on a vacant lot including a new
foundation. Building may be constructed on or off site.
Exterior Alterations  Any project that involves a change of the buildings footprint
through either demolition or addition or a change in the appearance of roof lines or other
significant architectural feature as well as foundation improvements to the existing
structures which change the peak roof height by more than two feet (2) plus or minus.
Rehabilitation  Any project that updates and/or improves the condition of a house, and
brings it into compliance with current building codes, but does not substantially alter the
exterior appearance of the house.
§ 5.2.3 Procedures
A. Neighborhood Compatibility Survey (NCS): Using the Neighborhood Compatibility
Worksheet and the guide to the Housing Styles of Cambridge, available upon request
from the office of the Zoning Official, the applicant shall undertake an NCS of the
properties surrounding the proposed site to determine the prevailing height, mass,
scale, square footage, architectural details and styles of construction in the
neighborhood.
B. The applicant shall submit the results of the NCS, supporting documents and an
application for Category 2 site plan per § 3.1.7 to the Zoning Official for review and
approval.
C. Application of the provisions of this section shall be by administrative action by the
Zoning Official, except where the project meets the criteria for a Category 1 site plan
or major subdivision in which case, the Planning Commission shall be the approval
authority. Except where Planning Commission action is thus called for, the
procedures and timelines set forth in § 3.1.7 for Administrative Adjustments shall be
followed in the public notification, administrative review, decision making on
approval or denial, and/or on any appeal related to all new construction projects
within the Neighborhood Conservation (NC) districts and the DWDD Neighborhood
Subdistrict.
D. Based on the NCS, the project shall meet the predominant setback, height, mass,
scale, and square footage prevalent in the neighborhood. Where the predominant
conditions are at odds with the minimum or maximum lot and bulk requirements
set forth in Tables 5 and 6 of this Ordinance, the predominant conditions set forth in
an approved NCS shall govern, except that setbacks may not be adjusted under the
terms of this section, by more than 20 percent.
E. Where the Zoning Official determines that public health, safety, and welfare
considerations or compliance with the Citys adopted Comprehensive Plan compel
application of the strict dimensional standards set forth in Tables 5 and 6 or
154
otherwise provided for in this Ordinance, such strict standards shall apply
notwithstanding the findings of an NCS.
F. For development projects that do, or will ultimately, consist of multiple houses in
close proximity to each other or where, by virtue of the size of the undeveloped tract
or preponderance of vacant lots in the immediate neighborhood, a predominant
character is not discernable, the Zoning Official may apply flexibility in the
application of the Compatibility Guidelines and in the review of the NCS to bring
about a unified settlement pattern in keeping with overall purposes of this
Ordinance, within the limitations established in paragraph D above to the greatest
extent practicable.
§ 5.2.4 Compatibility Guidelines
A. General architectural features such as porches, roof pitch, chimneys and trim details
shall meet the predominant details and pattern of the neighborhood. Chimneys will
be required only for functional purposes. Faux chimney structures may be allowed
as an architectural feature as part of the compatibility requirement. Consideration
will be given to elements that provide added energy efficiency or other means of
lowering operating costs for the occupant of the house.
B. Minimum Design Guidelines
1. Foundations
a. Foundation heights shall be consistent with the neighborhoods
pattern of development in the survey area.
b. Slab on grade foundations will be considered if the house is designed
for adaptation to applicable accessibility standards as established by
code.
c. Excessive or disproportionate foundation heights shall be discouraged
as a means of increasing overall roof peak height.
2. Roof Pitch and Height on the Primary Structure
a. Roof pitches shall be similar to the predominate pitch in the
neigborhood.
b. Attached garages shall have a roof pitch matching the main house.
Consideration may be given for other architecture designs that may
complement the structure.
c. Porch covers, dormers and other attachments to the above may be
lower.
3. Setbacks
a. The front of main house (excluding front porch) shall be built to align
with front build-to-line of neighboring dwellings (excluding front
porches). If such dwellings are inconsistently aligned with respect to
the street, then the house shall be aligned with longer setback or in a
manner most consistent with the neighborhood.
155
b. Limited consideration may be given to increasing the front yard
setback for installation of off-street parking in neighborhoods which
may present on-street parking concerns provided the effect of the
increased setback is not to distract from neighborhood compatibility.
4. Exterior Materials
a. Siding and trim  shall be of durable materials and be in keeping with
the styles of the surrounding properties and shall be consistently
applied to the structure, e.g., mismatched siding materials (part vinyl,
part asphalt tile) or styles (part beaded 8, part double 4) are not to
be permitted.
b. Windows  shall be in keeping with size and type of surrounding
properties, and meet City of Cambridge and building code
requirements.
c. Roofing materials  shall be in keeping with the type of surrounding
properties and meet City of Cambridge and building code
requirements.
5. Façade Requirements
a. Any front-facing gables shall include gable overhang of not less than
eight (8) inches.
b. Front facing gables shall include an attic window, if compatible with
the surrounding properties, and/or decorative gable treatments.
c. Front entry porch roof shall be differentiated from the main structure
roof.
d. Front entry porches shall be a minimum of 2x the width of the front
doorway, including any sidelights, and a minimum of 4 feet deep or
fully cover the front entry landing area, whichever is greater. Porches
over 30 inches in height above the grade require railings as required
by building codes.
e. Front entrance stairways (steps and landings) shall be in keeping with
the surrounding properties. Uncovered (no roof structure) pre-cast
concrete or lumber entrance stairways shall be considered only when
no predominant style is found within the survey area. Partially
covered front entry stairways and landings may be considered when
designed as an architectural feature of a structure. Front entrance
ramps, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, shall be
designed in keeping with the neighborhood or to minimize the impact
to the streetscape, and shall be built to all applicable codes.
f. Any attached front-loading garage or carport shall be set behind the
front façade of the main structure by a minimum of four (4) feet.
6. Streets with Substandard Architecture
a. Where there are residences with architecture not in compliance with
these standards, residential units with architecture in compliance with
these standards shall determine the materials and style of the new
156
construction. If necessary, examples of acceptable architecture may be
on adjacent streets.
b. Examples of substandard and acceptable architecture are as follows:
Non-comply Architecture
Non-complying Architecture
Complying Architecture
157
Non-complying Architecture
Complying Architecture
158
5.3 Creation of Lots
§ 5.3.1 Standards for New Lots
A. Lot Sizes
Lots shall be created to conform to the size and dimensions set forth in § 5.1.1. In no
case may a lot be platted that has less area or width than required by this Ordinance
in the zone where it is to be located.
B. Lot Shape
1. Excessive lot depth in relation to lot width should be avoided; with a
proportion of 2.5 to 1 considered a desirable maximum. Pointed or irregular
lot shapes shall be avoided.
2. Side lot lines should generally be at right angles to straight street centerlines
and radial to curved street centerlines. However, this standard is not
intended to prohibit the creation of lots at a reasonable angle to the street
159
where the intent is to create a lot orientation to enhance solar-related energy
techniques.
4. No subdivision plat shall create remnants of land that would have no
apparent use or control.
5. Flag, pipe-stem, or panhandle lots shall not be permitted.
6. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be strictly avoided except
where required to avoid fronting lots onto arterial or other major non-access
streets, or to separate residential areas from incompatible non-residential
development, or to overcome some specific and unique site related
disadvantage such as topography.
C. Frontage and Access to Street
1. Except along streets existing prior to January 1, 2013, no residential lot in the
Residential and Corridor Mixed-Use districts shall be created which does not both
front onto a public street and back onto an alley.
2. A street address for each lot shall be as assigned by the City in order to
ensure a separate and distinct address for each lot created.
3. No lot, regardless of use, shall derive vehicular access directly from an
arterial road, unless alternative access is strictly prevented by topographic
and related physical conditions such as site distance requirements and
environmental conditions.
4. Where adjoining lots front onto an arterial road, the City may require that
such lots be served by a combined drive in order to limit possible traffic
hazard, reduce the number of driveway connections to the public right-ofway,
protect aesthetic character, limit overall impervious surface coverage or
otherwise implement the purposes of this Ordinance.
5. Driveways shall be arranged to avoid vehicles backing into traffic and, on
residential lots, vehicles parking in the front yard between the house and the
street.
6. Every lot shall abut an approved public street that is sufficient to afford a
reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles. The
reviewing authority, whether it is the Planning Commission or Zoning
Official, shall have the authority to approve or disapprove any point of
ingress or egress to any lot, tract, parcel or development from any street or
highway.

Site and Building Design Standards
§ 6.1 General Environmental Standards
§ 6.2 Landscaping Requirements
§ 6.3 Parking and Loading
§ 6.4 General Building Design Standards
§ 6.5 Signs
§ 6.1 General Environmental Standards
This section establishes environmental standards for all subdivisions and development
plans requiring approval.
§ 6.1.1 Land Suitability
A. Unsuitable Land Not for Development
B. No land shall be subdivided for development that is held unsuitable for its proposed
use by the Planning Commission for reasons of flooding, being located within the
100-year floodplain, inadequate drainage, excessive slope, severe erosion potential,
or any other natural features that may be harmful to the health, safety, and welfare
of future residents, property owners or the community at large.
C. Proposed Improvements to Unsuitable Land
D. All proposed improvements necessary to make land suitable for development shall
be in full compliance with any laws and ordinances regulating such improvements
and with any conditions as may be required by the Planning Commission to reduce
risks to health and safety. The ability to mitigate an environmental health concern
through proposed improvements in no way guarantees that the Planning
Commission will approve a project on land that is otherwise environmentally
unsuitable for its proposed use.
E. Deed Restrictions Required
F. When a subdivider does not intend to develop the plat him or herself and the
improvements are necessary to reduce hazards and/or to make land suitable for
development, the Planning Commission shall require appropriate deed restrictions
to be inserted on every deed and noted on every recorded plat and parcel.
§ 6.1.2 Perennial Stream No Disturbance Buffer
161
A. Buffer Required
1. A one hundred (100) foot vegetative buffer from all perennial streams shall
be required for all development, except that in the Resource Conservation
district the buffer shall be 200 feet wide from all perennial streams.
2. Permanent or temporary stormwater and/or sediment control devices shall
not be permitted in this buffer.
3. As a condition of site plan or subdivision plat approval, in so far as possible,
the buffer shall be planted in plant species native to the region according to a
landscape and/or forest conservation plan submitted with the application.
B. Expanded Buffer May Be Required
The perennial stream buffer shall be expanded to include contiguous 100-year
floodplain and the non-tidal wetlands, hydric soils, highly erodible soils, and soils on
slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) that are adjacent to or contiguous with the
perennial stream.
C. Modification of Buffer
In the review of a site plan or subdivision plat, the Planning Commission may
modify this buffer requirement provided it be not less than 75 feet, if it establishes
written finding of fact that:
1. The design, construction and use of the entire site with less than a 100-foot
buffer will provide the same or greater protection of water quality as the
100-foot buffer, and the development proposal provides heightened
measures to minimize the runoff of stormwater from the site and to
minimize impervious surfaces and the removal of natural vegetation within
100 feet of the stream; or
2. It is the development of a planned public street that has necessitated an
incursion into the buffer and evidence is provided that disturbance will be
minimized insofar as possible; or
3. Other public or community facilities are required and evidence is provided
that disturbance will be minimized insofar as possible.
§ 6.1.3 Intermittent Stream No Disturbance Buffer
A. Buffer Required
1. A 50-foot vegetative buffer from all intermittent streams shall be required
for all development.
2. Permanent or temporary stormwater and/or sediment control devices shall
not be permitted in this buffer.

the buffer shall be planted in plant species native to the region according to a
landscape and/or forest conservation plan submitted with the application.
B. Expanded Buffer May Be Required
162
The intermittent stream buffer shall be expanded to include contiguous 100-year
floodplain and non-tidal wetlands, hydric soils, highly erodible soils, and soils on
slopes greater than 15 percent that are contiguous with the stream.
C. Modification of Buffer
The Planning Commission may modify this buffer requirement provided it be not
less than 25 feet, if it establishes written finding of fact that:
1. It is the development of a planned public street or other infrastructure that
has necessitated an incursion into the buffer and evidence is provided that
disturbance will be minimized insofar as possible; or
2. It is the development of other necessary public or community facilities that
has necessitated an incursion into the buffer and evidence is provided that
disturbance will be minimized insofar as possible.
§ 6.1.4 Nontidal Wetland Buffer
A. Buffer Required
A minimum 25-foot setback from all nontidal wetlands shall be required for all
development around the extent of the delineated nontidal wetland except as may be
permitted by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and the State of Maryland,
Department of Natural Resources, Nontidal Wetland Division.
B. Expanded Buffer May Be Required
The wetland buffer shall be expanded to include contiguous 100-year floodplain,
hydric soils, highly erodible soils, and soils on slopes greater than 15 percent that
are contiguous with the wetland. Addtionally, the buffer shall be expanded to 50
feet for large-scale developmet containing over 10 acres.
C. Modification
In the review of a site plan or subdivision plat, the Planning Commission may
modify this buffer requirement provided the buffer is not less than 25 feet upon
establishing written findings of fact that:
1. The development proposal provides heightened measures to minimize the
runoff of stormwater from the site and to minimize impervious surfaces and
the removal of natural vegetation within 50 feet of the wetland; or
2. It is the development of a planned public street or other infrastructure that
has necessitated an incursion into the buffer and evidence is provided that
disturbance will be minimized insofar as possible; or
3. It is the development of other necessary public or community facilities that
has necessitated an incursion into the buffer and evidence is provided that
disturbance will be minimized insofar as possible.
§ 6.1.5 Steep Slopes
163
A. No Disturbance of Steep Slope
No structure, impervious surface or other land disturbance shall occur on any slope
with a grade of 15 percent or greater unless the Zoning Official determines that the
structure, impervious surface or land disturbance is necessary for stabilization of
the slope.
B. Buffer
A minimum 50-foot buffer shall be established between development and the crest
of slopes in excess of 25 percent.
§ 6.1.6 Habitats of Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species
Development shall avoid areas of Habitat of Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species as
defined by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
§ 6.1.7 Forest Conservation
A. Forest Conservation Ordinance
The Forest Conservation Act of the State of Maryland, as administered by the City,
shall be complied with in all respects within the boundaries of the City of
Cambridge.
B. Landscaping and Tree Requirements in Subdivisions
1. Existing trees shall be preserved whenever possible. The protection of trees
six inches or more in diameter (measured at breast height) shall be given
high priority in determining the location for open spaces, structures,
underground utilities, walks, and paved areas. Areas in which trees are
preserved shall remain undisturbed wherever possible.
2. Where extensive natural tree cover and vegetation does not exist,
landscaping and the planting of native tree species shall be provided to
establish a tree canopy, enhance the appearance of the development, aid
erosion control and stormwater runoff management, provide protection
from wind and sun, screen and shade streets and paved areas, promote
energy conservation of buildings, and enhance the privacy of dwelling units.
3. The Citys street tree planting guidelines shall be followed in the installation
of new subdivision streets. At minimum and unless more specific guidance is
provided in the street tree guidelines, the developer shall plant one street
tree on both sides of every proposed new street within 50 feet of the
centerline of the street at intervals of at least 40 feet. Selected trees shall be
as approved by the Zoning Official.
C. Retention and Protection of Large Trees
164
1. Every site plan submitted for approval shall identify all trees 18 inches in
diameter or greater. Each shall be preserved to the greatest extent practical.
2. No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the
drip line of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more and no impervious
surface may be located within 12.5 feet of any such tree unless compliance
with the subsection would unreasonably burden the development as defined
in paragraph 3 below. For reasons of this section, a drip line is defined as a
perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk where
precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground.
3. The retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or greater as
provided in the above subsections unreasonably burdens the developer if, to
accomplish such tree protection, the design and location of improvements on
a lot or the proposed use of the lot would have to be substantially altered and
such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer.
4. The loss of space for vehicle parking shall not be grounds to establish an
unreasonable burden. Should parking be less than required on account of
tree protection herein provided, then the approving authority under this
Ordinance shall grant a modification of the parking standard.
5. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Maryland Forest Conservation
Act, any removal of trees of 18 inches in diameter or greater through the
development of an approved site plan shall be mitigated through the planting
of replacement trees on site which are native species shade trees at a ratio of
two trees planted for each one lost which tree planting shall be above and
beyond that which may be required by
§ 6.2. The approving authority shall place conditions necessary at site plan
approval to ensure the health and longevity of the new trees.
§ 6.2 Landscaping
§ 6.2.1 Landscaping Requirements
A. Landscape Plan
A landscaping plan shall be submitted for approval by the Planning Commission as
part of every Category 1 site plan and may be required by the Zoning Official for
review of a Category 2 site plan.
B. Content of Landscape Plan
A landscaping plan shall include dimensions and distances and clearly delineate all
buildings and existing and proposed parking spaces or other vehicle areas, access
aisles, driveways, and the location, size, species, and description of all landscaping
materials to be used.

1. All developments shall be fully screened on each side that adjoins a
residential use up to the minimum height of four feet. Required screening
shall consist of either a masonry wall or wooden fence not greater than six
feet in height, an evergreen hedge, or a fully planted landscape area of at
least ten feet in width.
2. All service structures, which include dumpsters, propane tanks, air
conditioning units, and related equipment or elements providing service to a
building or site, shall be fully screened with landscaping and/or a fence or
wall.
D. Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping
All off-street parking lots, whether or not located on the same lot as the use to which
it is accessory, containing ten or more parking spaces, shall meet the following
perimeter landscaping requirements.
1. A landscaping strip with a minimum width of ten feet shall be located
between the parking lot and the adjoining lot lines.
2. A minimum of one shade tree for every 40 feet of lot perimeter shall be
planted in the landscaping strip. Deciduous shade trees with ground cover or
with low shrubs shall be used as the primary landscape materials.
3. On the landscaping strip adjacent to a right-of-way, a compact evergreen
hedge, an ornamental wall, or a wooden fence of not less than four feet or
greater than six feet in height is required.
4. Per § 6.2.2 of this Ordinance, within the Downtown/Waterfront Development
district, the Planning Commission may modify the perimeter parking
requirements.
E. Internal Landscaping of Parking Lot
Any parking lot of 25 or more spaces shall be internally landscaped with shade
trees. Shade trees shall be planted in planting areas. Planting areas shall comprise at
least ten percent of the internal area of the parking lot. Shade trees shall be installed
such that no parking space is located more than 60 feet from a parking lot shade
tree. Planting areas should be wide enough to allow for the mature growth of the
trees chosen and no paving shall be located within 12.5 feet of the tree trunk.
Illustration 3 shows the appropriate application of these standards.
Illustration 3
166
F. Landscaping for Stormwater Management
1. Landscaping in relation to parking lots may be used for stormwater
management provided the requirements of this section are met.
2. Bio-retention swales are allowed in perimeter and internal parking lot
landscaping areas and planting areas.
G. Building Wall Yard Planting
A planting area shall be established along any building wall facing an adjacent offstreet
parking lot or right-of-way. Shade trees, ornamental trees, and shrubs shall be
planted in this planting area to aesthetically enhance the appearance of buildings
and provide shade according to the following minimum standard: one shade tree for
every 50 feet of wall yard length and one ornamental tree for every 30 feet of wall
yard length.
H. Required Planting Material
In meeting the requirements of this Ordinance, only those plants listed on the Citys
Recommended Plant and Landscape Guidelines, which shall be maintained by the
Zoning Official, shall be used.

condition, replaced when necessary and kept free of refuse and debris.
Fences and walls shall be maintained in good repair.
2. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement
of all landscaping and screening materials as may be required by the
provisions of this Section.
3. Failure to maintain required landscaping, or to adhere to an approved
landscaping plan, shall constitute a zoning violation subject to the remedies
set forth in this Ordinance.
§ 6.2.2 Waiver or Modification
Provided that the Planning Commission establishes findings of fact that a modification will
not have any deleterious effect on existing or planned development of adjacent properties
and finds that the purposes of this section will be met, it may approve a waiver or
modification of the requirements of this Section. Such waiver or modification may be
approved in the following three instances: for an interim use of a duration of less than two
years; or where deemed appropriate due to the location, size, configuration or topographic
condition of the lot, or where the project is located in the Downtown/rWaterfront
Development District and strict application of the landscaping requirements would
interfere with the purposes of the zoning subdistrict wherein the project is located.
§ 6.3 Parking and Loading
§ 6.3.1 Intent and Purposes
A. Intent
This section establishes requirements for motor vehicle and bicycle parking,
including the minimum number of spaces required by land use.
B. Purposes
1. To ensure that adequate parking spaces are provided in relation to
development sites at time of development so that parking does not overflow
onto adjoining streets that may not be designed to handle it.
2. To ensure that safe and convenient accommodations are made for bicycle
parking.
§ 6.3.2 Off-Street Parking Required
A. Schedule of Required Parking
168
1. Except as provided in § 6.3.3, in all districts, space for parking vehicles shall
be provided in accordance with the Schedule of Minimum Off-Street Parking

§ 6.3.3 Modification of Parking Requirement
A. Due to Zoning District
The minimum parking requirements set forth in § 6.3.2 shall be modified according
to the following:
1. In the Downtown/Waterfront, Core subdistrict, no parking lot serving more
than 10 parked cars shall hereafter be created, unless reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission. If parking is to be provided on-site, in
the Downtown/Waterfront Core subdistrict, the minimum off-street parking
requirements set forth in § 6.3.2 shall be considered the maximum allowed.
There shall be no requirement for automobile parking as a condition of any
site plan approval.
2. In the Downtown/Waterfront District, outside of the Core subdistrict, no offstreet
parking shall be required as a condition of any site plan approval.
3. On lots used for single-family detached residences, in the NC districts and in
the Residential, Downtown/Waterfront, and Corridor Mixed-Use districts, no
off-street parking shall be required except where the abutting street is
determined by the Zoning Official to be too narrow to accommodate the
parking requirements of the residence.
4. In every other zoning district, the minimum parking requirements of § 6.3.2
shall be adhered to, except that under no circumstance may the numerical
standards be exceeded by more than 10 percent.
B. Due to Site Conditions
Should the configuration of the lot, the placement of existing conforming structures,
or a change of use to a conforming and more intensive use, preclude strict
adherence to § 6.3.2, the Planning Commission, in relation to a Category 1 site plan,
or the Zoning Official in relation to a Category 2 site plan, may modify the parking
requirements provided there are findings of facts that:
172
1. Adequate public off-street parking is available within reasonable walking
distance; or
2. On-street parking is available and adequate and that the parking required by
the contemplated use will not materially impede the flow of traffic or
preempt existing residential parking; or
3. A written agreement is established and made part of any site plan approval,
allowing parking required by the use of an adequate off-street parking lot
within a reasonable walking distance.
C. Due to Joint Use of Parking
Where joint use of parking by one or more uses is possible, the Planning
Commission, in relation to a Category 1 site plan, or the Zoning Official in relation to
a Category 2 site plan, may modify the parking requirements provided there are
findings of facts that:
1. Joint use of parking spaces will not reduce the availability of parking spaces
below the minimum required number of spaces required by each use during
its peak demand.
2. A written agreement is established and made part of any site plan approval
providing for the joint use of spaces.
D. Due to Lack of Demand
Should the applicant demonstrate and the Planning Commission, in relation to a
Category 1 site plan, or the Zoning Official in relation to a Category 2 site plan, find
that a sizeable share of site-related traffic would access the site by bicycle and/or
walking, then minimum parking requirements may be reduced.
§ 6.3.4 Minimum Bicycle Parking Requirements by Land Use
A. Schedule of Required Parking
Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule. In all
districts, either space for parking and/or storage of bicycles shall be provided or the
applicant shall demonstrate that adequate bicycle parking is provided for.
Bed and breakfast houses, hotels, motels the greater of 2, or 1 per 25 employees
Retail sales, service operations the greater of 2, or 1 per 5,000 s.f. gfa
Office buildings the greater of 4, or 1 per 5,000 s.f. gfa
Museums, libraries, similar the greater of 4, or 1 per 2,000 s.f. gfa
churches, similar 1 per 50 seats
Community centers 1 per 250 s.f. gfa
schools
a) elementary 1 per 10 students
b) middle and high 1 per 6 students
Indoor amusement 4, or 1 per 50 seats
restaurants 4, or 1 per 50 seats
173
Other commercial, industrial 2, or 1 per 50 employees
B. Waiver or Modification
The Planning Commission may waive or modify the bike-parking requirement in the
Downtown/Waterfront Development District upon finding that there is an adequate
supply of publicly accessible bike parking already provided within a 300 feet
walking distance.
Design of Bicycle Parking Spaces
1. Each bicycle parking space shall be sufficient to accommodate a bicycle at
least six (6) feet in length and two feet wide, and shall be provided with some
form of stable frame permanently anchored to a foundation to which a
bicycle frame and both wheels may be conveniently secured using a chain
and padlock, locker, or other storage facilities which are convenient for
storage and are reasonably secure from theft and vandalism. The separation
of the bicycle parking spaces and the amount of corridor space shall be
adequate for convenient access to every space when the parking facility is
full.
2. When automobile parking spaces are provided in a structure, at least 70
percent of required bicycle spaces shall be located inside that structure or
shall be located in other areas protected from the weather. Bicycle parking
spaces in parking structures shall be clearly marked as such and shall be
separated from auto parking by some form of barrier to minimize the
possibility of a parked bicycle being hit by a car.
3. Bicycle parking spaces shall be located near the entrance of use being served
and within view of pedestrian traffic if possible, and shall be sufficiently
secure to reasonably reduce the likelihood of bicycle theft.
4. Bicycle parking facilities shall not impede pedestrian or vehicular circulation.
5. Racks must not be placed close enough to a wall or other obstruction so as to
make use difficult. There must be sufficient space (at least 24 inches) beside
each parked bike that allows access. This access may be shared by adjacent
bicycles. An aisle or other space shall be provided to bicycles to enter and
leave the facility. This aisle shall have a width of at least six feet to the front
or rear of a bike parked in the facility.
6. The outside ground surface of bicycle parking areas shall be paved or other
hard surface. Bike parking facilities within automobile parking lots shall be
separated by a physical barrier to protect bicycles from damage by cars, such
as curbs, wheel stops, poles or other similar features.
§ 6.3.5 Off-Street Loading Spaces Required
In any district, except the Downtown/Waterfront district, in connection with every
building or part thereof, having a gross floor area of 4,000 square feet or more, whenever
the normal operation of the use requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be
routinely delivered to or shipped from that use, sufficient loading and unloading space shall
174
be provided for and the Planning Commission may require that adequate off-street loading
areas be provided and maintained on the same lot as the building or use. Loading space
shall be not less than ten feet in width, 45 feet in length, and 14 feet in height.
§ 6.4 General Commercial/Mixed Use Building
Design Standards
§ 6.4.1 Purpose and Applicability
A. Purpose
This section is intended to establish the general requirements for the appearance of
commercial buildings which are subject to site plan review and approval and
through the application of these standards promote and protect a cohesive
architectural character within the City. Additionally, these standards shall strive to
have new development evoke the essence of Cambridges unique character through
building design.
B. Applicability
These provisions shall apply to all commercial/mixed use developments where site
plan review is required in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 and shall be
enforced through the site plan approval process, except that this section shall not
apply to new residential construction.
C. Required Submittals
1. All Category 1 site plans and all site plans in the Historic District shall include
proposed street front elevations prepared by a licensed architect for all
buildings.
2. The Zoning Official may require that Category 2 site plan submittals contain
street front building elevations prepared by a licensed architect.
§ 6.4.2 Key Terms: Proportion/Rhythm/Scale
A. Terms
1. Proportion refers to the relationship between width and height of building
facade.
2. Rhythm refers to the repetition and space of opening (windows and doors)
on individual buildings as compared with adjacent structures. Rhythm also
refers to the spacing of repetitive building masses along a street.
3. Scale refers to the size (height/width) relationship between adjacent
structures. Human scale refers to the comfortable size relationship between
buildings and people.
B. General Standards
175
Illustration 4 shows the appropriate and inappropriate application of the basic
design standards set forth below.
1. Buildings
a. Large disparities between the height, width, and length of a building
shall be avoided.

f. Neighborhood context should dictate the choice of materials for the
exterior of buildings, when high quality materials are present, such as
but not limited to, brick, stone, metal, masonry, and fiber cement.
Illustration 4
176
2. Facades
a. The proportional relationship of individual facades shall emphasize the
vertical rather than the horizontal, where appropriate.
b. Building facades with wainscoting or water tables at the base of the
building shall have a horizontal projection of at least two (2) inches.
c. Building facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth
tones, while the building trim may be brighter colors for accent.
d. Primary entries of buildings shall be clearly defined and shall have
features such as canopies or porticos, overhangs, recess/projections,
raised cornices over the doors, peaked roof forms, and/or arches.
e. Large blank walls shall be avoided. Buildings shall be designed to
support a human-scale environment.
f. Building facades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length,
measured horizontally, shall have a recess or projection of a minimum
of two inches every thirty (30) to fifty (50) feet or change in building
material.
g. Long blank walls shall incorporate design elements that break up the
mass every thirty (30) to fifty (50) feet or create some kind of visual
interest.

§ 6.5.5 General Sign Standards
A. Standards are Maximum Allowable
The dimension requirements provided in this Section represent the maximum size
or area or distance allowed. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to imply that
these regulations confer a right to the maximum.
B. Computations of Area and Height
1. Area
a. Measurement of the area of a sign shall be based on the entire area of
the sign with a continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of
the sign surface. For a sign consisting of letters or symbols attached to
a building wall, or other surface, the area shall be computed by means
of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination
thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material
or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop, surface or structure
against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or
wall otherwise meets the requirements of this Ordinance and is
clearly incidental to the display itself.
b. When a sign consists of two or more faces, the area of all faces shall be
included in determining the area, except where two faces are placed
back to back and are at no point more than 18 inches from each other.
In this case, the sign area shall be determined by measuring either
face and if such faces are unequal, the largest face shall be used.
2. Height
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the
sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior
to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the
purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot
reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption
that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoning lot,
whichever is lower.
197
3. Sight Visibility
a. No sign shall obstruct a clear view to and from traffic along any street
right-of-way, entrance or exit.
b. A sight visibility triangle determined appropriate for the site by the
city engineer upon request of the Planning Commission or Zoning
Official shall be kept free of obstructions to vision between the heights
of two and one-half feet and twelve feet above the street.
C. Illumination/Lighting of Sign
1. No internally lighted signs shall be permitted within the Residential,
Institutional, Resource Conservation, or Open Space districts. Where
illumination of a sign is permitted in these districts, it shall be permitted only
by indirect means external to the sign face.
2. Electronic/Digital Signs are permitted in the General Commercial and
Industrial districts upon approval of the Zoning Official and provided the
following special standards are met:
a. Displays must use no more than three colors of light for entire sign
display.
b. Graphics and/or animation are not allowed.

Official.
d. The electronic message display may comprise no more than 35
percent of the face area.

frontage or signs may distribute the allowable signage equally on the
two frontages, if that total signage does not exceed the maximum
allowed. Signs may be installed on sides of the building with no street
frontage, such as facing parking lots, however, this signage will be
included in the maximum area calculation and such sides do not
receive the benefit of additional square footage.
c. For all other locations, one square foot per linear building frontage on
the public street up to a maximum allowable area of 100 square feet,
including free standing signs, except that each additional building
frontage facing a street may have up to 0.5 square foot of sign area per
linear foot of street frontage but and such additional sign area shall
only be used on that side of the building frontage or signs may
distribute the allowable signage equally on the two frontages, if that
total signage does not exceed the maximum allowed. Signs may be
installed on sides of the building with no street frontage, such as facing
parking lots, however, this signage will be included in the maximum
area calculation and such sides do not receive the benefit of additional
square footage.
2. Multi-tenant signs may be permitted for the purpose of consolidating several
signs into one sign structure. No separate on premise freestanding sign shall
be permitted for site occupants that already have an identification panel on a
multi-tenant sign. A multi-tenant sign shall be spaced at a minimum of 300
feet from another multi-tenant sign.

streets if applicable for the entire tract shall be submitted for Planning
Commission approval concurrent with subdivision plat review.
B. Block Dimensions
1. No Residential Lane, or Secondary or Primary Residential Street shall exceed
500 feet without intersecting another street or lane except as provided
below.
2. The intersections of residential streets and lanes with Collector Streets, as

point unless the City Engineer certifies that such an intersection can be
constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
2. Wherever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall
coincide with existing and proposed intersections on the opposite side of
such street. In any event, where a center offset (jog) occurs at an intersection,
the distance between center lines of the intersection streets shall not be less
than 300 feet except where the intersecting streets and the intersected street
are secondary residential streets or residential lanes; in such case the
distance between center lines of the intersection streets shall not be less than
200 feet.
3. Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two
streets may intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance of
less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersecting
street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the distance between
intersecting streets shall be at least 1,320 feet or otherwise in conformance
with the Maryland State Highway Administration criteria. Any site plan or
subdivision with proposed access to a State Highway must obtain State
Highway Administration access permit approval prior to receiving final
approval from the Planning Commission.

construction to the developer as the city may deem to be advisable. This
additional development may include, but shall not be limited to, widening of
streets, placing or replacing curb, gutter and sidewalk, placing of traffic
control devices, purchasing rights-of-way, etc., in order to provide for the
safe and efficient flow of traffic primarily attributable to the development
under consideration. The exact requirements, if any, will be set by the
planning commission and approved by city council.
7. Bond requirements. The city requires all developers to post separate
performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100 percent of the
construction costs.
a. Extension of time may be obtained by application to the city engineer
and upon findings by him/her of such facts as will justify a further
extension of time to complete the required improvements.
b. This bond will be reduced as work is completed, less ten percent to be
retained until one year from the date of substantial completion.
D. Section 409 Sec. 17-39. Inspection; acceptance.
1. Approval of a plat does not constitute acceptance by the City of the offer of
dedication of any streets, sidewalks, parks, or other public facilities shown on
215
a plat. However, the City may accept any such offer of dedication through the
acceptance of a properly prepared deed.
2. All improvements must be inspected by and completed to the satisfaction of
the city engineer before any building permits will be issued.
3. Acceptance by the city after completion by the developer will be made within
one year of final inspection by the city. Any defects found in the construction
prior to that time shall be repaired by the developer prior to acceptance by
the city.
E. Section 410 Sec. 17-40. Protection against defects.
1. Whenever (pursuant to terms of the City Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision
Regulations) occupancy, use or sale is allowed before the completion of all
facilities or improvements intended for dedication, then the performance
bond or the surety that is posted pursuant to Section 17-42 shall guarantee
that any defects in such improvements or facilities that appear within one
year after the dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted shall
be corrected by the developer.
2. Whenever all public facilities or improvements intended for dedication are
installed before occupancy, use, or sale is authorized, then the developer
shall post a performance bond or other sufficient surety to guarantee that he
will correct all defects in such facilities or improvements that occur within
one year after the City has taken title to or possession of the public facilities
and/or improvements.
F. Section 411 Sec. 17-41. Maintenance of dedicated areas until acceptance.
All facilities and improvements with respect to which the owner makes an offer of
dedication to public use shall be maintained by the owner until such offer of
dedication is accepted by the appropriate public authority.
§ 7.3.2 Dedication and Acceptance of Streets and Facilities
A. Offer of Dedication
Unless the recorded plat of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private the
recording of such plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street.
B. Acceptance
The approval of a final subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply
the acceptance by the City of any street, sidewalks, parks or other public facility
shown on said plat. Acceptance of all such public spaces and facilities by the City
occurs only after all public improvements have been completed in accordance with
the Cambridge design and specification manual and/or any other City specifications
through the acceptance by the City of a properly prepared deed. The City shall
inspect all such facilities and improvements.
C. Stormwater management facilities, open spaces and other amenities not within
public rights-of-way or on land planned to be dedicated to the City will not become
216
the maintenance responsibility of the City of Cambridge. The applicant for
development approval shall propose, as part of the site plan or subdivision plat
approval, the entity which shall be responsible for ongoing maintenance.
§ 7.3.3 Bonding and Guarantee of Public Improvements
A. City Bonding Procedures

related to water-dependent facilities or Habitat Protection Areas.
§ 8.5.2 Variances
A. Applicability
Cambridge has established provisions where, owing to special features of a site or
other circumstances, implementation of this Article or a literal enforcement of
provisions within this Article would result in unwarranted hardship to an applicant,
a Critical Area variance may be obtained.
1. In considering an application for a variance, the Board of Appeals shall
presume that the specific development activity in the Critical Area, that is
subject to the application and for which a variance is required, does not
conform with the general purpose and intent of Natural Resources Article,
Title 8 Subtitle 18, COMAR Title 27, and the requirements of this Article.
2. Unwarranted hardship means that without a variance, an applicant would be
denied reasonable and significant use of the entire parcel or lot for which the
variance is requested.
B. Standards
The provisions for granting such a variance shall include evidence submitted by the
applicant that the following standards are met:
1. Special conditions or circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or
structure involved and that a literal enforcement of provisions and
requirements of this Article would result in unwarranted hardship;
2. A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Article will deprive the
applicant the use of land or a structure permitted to others in accordance
with the provisions of this Critical Area Ordinance;
3. The granting of a variance will not confer upon an applicant any special
privilege that would be denied by this Article to other lands or structures
within the Critical Area;
4. The variance request is not based upon conditions or circumstances which
are the result of actions by the applicant, including the commencement of
development activity before an application for a variance has been filed, nor
does the request arise from any condition relating to land or building use,
either permitted or nonconforming on any neighboring property; and
5. The granting of a variance shall not adversely affect water quality or
adversely impact fish, wildlife or plant habitat within the Critical Area and
237
the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general spirit and
intent of the Critical Area Law and this Article.
C. Process
Applications for a variance will be made in writing to the Board of Appeals with a
copy provided to the Critical Area Commission. The Board of Appeals shall follow its
established procedures for advertising and notification of affected landowners.
1. After hearing an application for a Critical Area variance, the Board of Appeals
shall make written findings reflecting analysis of each standard.
2. If the variance request is based on conditions or circumstances that are the
result of actions by the applicant, the Board of Appeals shall consider that
fact.
3. The applicant has the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion to
overcome the presumption of nonconformance established in A above.
4. The Board of Appeals shall notify the Critical Area Commission of its findings
and decision to grant or deny the variance request.
D. Findings
Based on competent and substantial evidence, the Board of Appeals shall make
written findings as to whether the applicant has overcome the presumption of
nonconformance as established in A above, and if applicable B above. With due
regard for the persons technical competence, and specialized knowledge, the
written findings may be based on evidence introduced and testimony presented by
the applicant, City Officials or staff or any other government agency; or any other
person deemed appropriate by the Board of Appeals.
E. Appeals
Appeals from decisions concerning the granting or denial of a variance under these
regulations shall be taken in accordance with all applicable laws and procedures for
variances. Variance decisions by the Board of Appeals may be appealed to the
Circuit Court in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Appeals may be
taken by any person, firm, corporation or governmental agency aggrieved or
adversely affected by any decision made under this Article.
F. Conditions and Mitigation
The Board of Appeals shall impose conditions on the use or development of a
property which is granted a variance as it may find reasonable to ensure that the
spirit and intent of this Article is maintained including, but not limited to the
following:
1. Adverse impacts resulting from the granting of the variance shall be
mitigated as recommended by the Planning Commission, but not less than by
planting on the site at the rate of at least three to one per square foot of the
variance granted.
238
2. New or expanded structures or lot coverage shall be located the greatest
possible distance from mean high water, the landward edge of tidal wetlands,
tributary streams, nontidal wetlands, or steep slopes.
G. Commission Notification
Within ten (10) working days after a written decision regarding a variance
application is issued, a copy of the decision will be sent to the Critical Area
Commission. No permit for the activity that was the subject of the application will be
issued until the applicable 30-day appeal period has elapsed.
§ 8.5.3 Lot Consolidation and Reconfiguration
A. Applicability
The provisions of this section apply to a consolidation or a reconfiguration of any
nonconforming legal grandfathered parcel or lot. These provisions do not apply to
the reconfiguration or consolidation of parcels or lots which are conforming or meet
all Critical Area requirements. Nonconforming parcels or lots include:
1. Those for which a Critical Area variance is sought or has been issued; and
2. Those located in the Resource Conservation Area and are less than 20 acres
in size.
B. Procedure
An applicant seeking a parcel or lot consolidation or reconfiguration shall provide
the information required in COMAR 27.01.02.08.E.
1. Cambridge will not approve a proposed parcel or lot consolidation or
reconfiguration without making written findings in accordance with COMAR
27.01.02.08.F.
2. The Planning Commission shall issue a final written decision or order
granting or denying an application for a consolidation or reconfiguration.
a. After a final written decision or order is issued, the Planning

stopunauthorized activity and restore and stabilize the site, as appropriate,
to its condition prior to the violation or to a condition that provides the same
water quality and habitat benefits; and
3. Require the implementation of mitigation measures, in addition to
restoration activities, to offset the environmental damage and degradation or
loss of environmental benefit resulting from the violation.
E. Right to Enter Property
Except as otherwise authorized and in accordance with the procedures specified
herein, the Mayor and Council or their designee may obtain access to and enter a
property in order to identify or verify a suspected violation, restrain a development
activity, or issue a citation if the City has probable cause to believe that a violation of
this Article has occurred, is occurring, or will occur. City officials shall make a
reasonable effort to contact a property owner before obtaining access to or entering
the property. If entry is denied, the City may seek an injunction to enter the
property to pursue an enforcement action.
F. Administrative Civil Penalties
In addition to any other penalty applicable under State or City law, every violation of
a provision of Natural Resources Article, Title 8 Subtitle 18 or Critical Area
provisions of this Article shall be punishable by a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per
calendar day.
1. Before imposing any civil penalty, the person(s) believed to have violated
this Article shall receive: written notice of the alleged violation(s) including
which, if any, are continuing violations, and an opportunity to be heard. The
amount of the civil penalty for each violation, including each continuing
violation, shall be determined separately. For each continuing violation, the
amount of the civil penalty shall be determined per day. In determining the
amount of the civil penalty, the City shall consider:
a. The gravity of the violation;
241
b. The presence or absence of good faith of the violator;
c. Any willfulness or negligence involved in the violation including a
history of prior violations;

mitigation for damage to that resource, including the cost to
Cambridge for performing, supervising, or rendering assistance to the
restoration and mitigation.
2. Administrative civil penalties for continuing violations shall accrue for each
violation, every day each violation continues, with no requirements for
additional assessments, notice, or hearings for each separate offense. The
total amount payable for continuing violations shall be the amount assessed
per day for each violation multiplied by the number of days that each
violation has continued.
3. The person responsible for any continuing violation shall promptly provide
the City with written notice of the date(s) the violation has been or will be
brought into compliance and the date(s) for City inspection to verify
compliance. Administrative civil penalties for continuing violations continue
to accrue as set forth herein until the City receives such written notice and
verifies compliance by inspection or otherwise.
4. Assessment and payment of administrative civil penalties shall be in addition
to and not in substitution for recovery by the City of all damages, costs, and
other expenses caused by the violation.
5. Payment of all administrative civil penalties assessed shall be a condition
precedent to the issuance of any permit or other approval required by this
Article.
G. Cumulative Remedies

alternative or exclusive, and the decision to pursue one remedy does not preclude
pursuit of others.
H. Injunctive Relief
1. The City may institute injunctive or other appropriate actions or proceedings
to bring about the discontinuance of any violation of this Article, an
administrative order, a permit, a decision, or other imposed condition.
2. The pendency of an appeal to the Board of Appeals or subsequent judicial
review shall not prevent the City from seeking injunctive relief to enforce an
administrative order, permit, decisions, or other imposed condition, or to
restrain a violation pending the outcome of the appeal or judicial review.
I. Variances Pursuant to a Violation
The City may accept an application for a variance regarding a parcel or lot that is subject to
a current violation of this subtitle or any provisions of an order, permit, plan, or this Article
242
