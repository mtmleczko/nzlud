PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Zachary, Louisiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines for ease of use. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Supervising Legal Editor, and Francine King, Legal Tech Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to William Joseph Cleveland, Esq., for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Home Rule Charter of Zachary, Louisiana, as adopted by voters on May 1, 2010, and approved by the Justice Department on July 26, 2010. This 2010 version replaces all previous versions of said Charter. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

The City shall have and exercise such other powers, rights, privileges, immunities, authority and functions not inconsistent with this charter as may be conferred on or granted to a local governmental Subdivision by the constitution and general laws of the state and, more specifically, the City shall have and is hereby granted the right and authority to exercise any power and perform any function necessary, requisite or proper for the management of its affairs, not denied by this charter, or by general law, or inconsistent, with the constitution.

ARTICLE II. - CITY COUNCIL 

Section 2-01. - Composition, Qualifications and Election. 
A.  The legislative power of the City shall be vested in a council consisting of five (5) members. Council members shall be elected by single member districts by all the qualified electors of the City. The boundaries of the single member districts shall be established by ordinance. 
B.  A member of the council shall be elected for a four (4) year term concurrent with that of the mayor and shall be eligible for reselection. 
C.  A council member shall be at least eighteen (18) years of age and a qualified elector of the municipality. 
D.  A council member shall have been legally domiciled and shall have actually resided for at least (1) year immediately preceding the time established by law for qualifying for office within the district sought to be represented. Once elected, a council member shall continue to be legally domiciled and to actually reside within the elected district during the term of office. Should the legal domicile and the actual residence of a council member change from that district within which elected for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days, the office shall automatically thereafter become vacant, which vacancy shall be filled as set out hereinafter. 
E.  Elections shall be held in accordance with the election laws of the state.

B.  A vacancy on the council shall be filled by appointment of a person meeting the qualification for office by a majority of the remaining members of the council. If one (1) year or less of the unexpired term remains when the vacancy occurs, the appointee shall serve out the remainder of the term. If the vacancy occurs more than one (1) year prior to the expiration of the term, the appointee shall serve until the office is filled by the vote of the qualified electors voting in a special election called by the council for that purpose, which election shall be held according to the timetable and procedures established by state law generally for the filling of vacancies in elected municipal offices. An appointee shall be eligible as a candidate for council member at the election to fill the vacancy. 
Section 2-03. - Compensation. 
A.  Monthly compensation for council members is mandated and shall be set by ordinance. Once set by ordinance, the compensation shall remain fixed unless and until changed by ordinance. No ordinance changing the compensation of a council member shall be adopted during the last year of a term of office and no such ordinance shall become effective during the term of a council adopting the ordinance. For purposes of the initial fixing, the ordinance in place at the time of the approval by the electors of the new charter or amendments shall become the effective compensation benchmark. 
B.  The council, by ordinance may adopt a system for reimbursement, upon presentation of properly documented receipts, of reasonable expenses necessary to the performance of official duties by a council member while outside the City. 
Section 2-04. - Prohibitions. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 3-06 (Mayor's Temporary Absence and Disability), a council member shall not hold any other elected public office, City office or City employment during the term for which elected to the council. No former council member shall hold any compensated appointive City office or City employment until one (1) year after the expiration of the term for which elected to the council. 
B.  Except as provided elsewhere in this charter neither the council nor any of its members shall involve themselves in any manner in the appointment, removal, direction or supervision of any City administrative officer or employee. 
Section 2-05. - Investigations. 
    The council, by the favorable vote of at least two-thirds of its authorized membership, may make investigations into the affairs of the City and the related conduct of any City official, officer, employee, department, office or agency and for this purpose may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony and require the production of evidence. The council may provide by ordinance for the punishment, as a misdemeanor, of a person for the willful failure or refusal to obey such subpoena or request for evidence. Investigations by the council shall be for specified purposes. 
Section 2-06. - Independent Audit. 
    The council shall provide for an annual, independent post-audit, and such additional audits as it deems necessary, of the accounts and other evidence of financial transactions of the City, including those of all City departments, offices or agencies. Auditors shall be designated by the council, shall be without personal interest in the affairs subject to audit and shall be a certified public accountant or firm of such accounts. The audit shall be submitted to the council at one of its regularly scheduled meetings and shall be a public record, and summary thereof shall be published at least once in the official journal. The council may accept audits by the state that satisfy the requirement of the council. 
Section 2-07. - Clerk of Council. 
    The council shall appoint a clerk of the council who shall serve in this capacity at the pleasure of the council. The clerk shall give notice of council meetings to its members and the public, keep the journal of its proceedings, be official secretary of the council and perform such other duties as are assigned to the position by this charter or by the council.

A.  The council shall meet regularly twice a month at such times and places as the council may prescribe by resolution adopted within thirty (30) days after taking office. Special meetings may be held on the call of the presiding officer or a majority of the authorized council membership and upon no less than twenty-four (24) hours' written notice to each member. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or public safety, the council may meet upon call of the presiding officer or a majority of the authorized council membership at whatever notice it shall be practical to give.

B.  All meetings of the council or its committees shall be held in compliance with state law governing public access to meetings of governing bodies. A meeting closed to the public shall be limited to matters allowed by law to be exempted from discussion at open meeting. No final or binding action shall be taken during a closed meeting. 
C.  The council shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall provide for keeping a journal of its minutes and proceedings. This journal shall be public record.

C.  With the final approval of ordinances by the mayor, or the council in case of a veto by the mayor, such enacted ordinances shall be published in full in the official journal by the clerk of the council as soon as practical thereafter provided, however, that ordinances adopting codes of technical regulations or adopting or amending the operating budget or capital improvement program may be published in full or in summary at the council's discretion. Every enacted ordinance, unless it shall specify another date, shall become effective at expiration of ten (10) calendar days after publication by the council or if the ordinance is adopted through a majority vote in a referendum election, then ten (10) calendar days after promulgation and publication of the election results by the council. 
Section 2-11. - Submission of Ordinances to the Mayor. 
A.  Every ordinance adopted by the council shall be signed by the mayor pro tempore and presented to the mayor within seven (7) calendar days after adoption, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays. The clerk of the council shall record upon the ordinance the date and hour of its delivery to the mayor. 
B.  Within seven (7) calendar days after the mayor's receipt of an ordinance, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and state holidays, it shall be returned to the clerk of the council with the mayor's approval, or with the mayor's veto. The clerk shall record upon the ordinance the date and hour of its receipt from the mayor. If the ordinance has been approved by the mayor, or the mayor has taken no action, it shall be considered finally enacted and become effective as provided in Section 2-10 (Ordinances in General). If the ordinance is vetoed, the mayor shall submit to the council through the clerk a written statement of the reasons for veto. All ordinances that the mayor vetoes shall be vetoed in full, except that the mayor shall have authority to veto individual appropriation items in the ordinance adopting the operating budget and capital improvement program. 
C.  Ordinances vetoed by the mayor shall be submitted by the clerk to the council no later than the next regular meeting held after receipt of the vetoed ordinance from the mayor. Should the council vote, not later than the second regular meeting held after receipt of the vetoed ordinance, to readopt ordinance by the favorable vote of at least two-thirds of its authorized membership, said ordinance shall be considered finally enacted and become law effective as provided in Section 2-10 irrespective of the veto by the mayor. 
D.  The right of the mayor to veto as provided in this section shall apply to all ordinances adopted by the council except those which propose amendments to this charter; establish, alter or modify council procedure; appropriate funds for auditing or investigating any part of the executive branch, or which the council has received specific approval to enact the ordinance following a referendum vote of the people. 
Section 2-12. - Emergency Ordinances.

The portion of the premium thusly paid shall be budgeted annually. If any elected city official or city employee retires with less than 15 years of consecutive credible service to the city, such retiree shall be entitled to the sum of $5.00 for each year of such service per month, to be applied against the cost of such medical coverage all in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section.

The amount to be expended under the terms of this section depends upon the amount of money made available and appropriated by the city for such purpose. At no time shall this provision be declared mandatory to the city, nor is it a condition for employment, nor shall it ever be expressed as a guaranteed benefit derived from employment; further, no collective bargaining agreement or plan of payment, whether through civil service or otherwise, shall make reference to this section or otherwise make such payment a condition of employment or create an obligation by the city to its employees or former employees.

The benefit to the city considered, such as the high visibility necessitated by police vehicles and fire vehicles and access to immediate call out of that employee, no reimbursement shall be due by the employee to the city. 
(2)  If an employee is hired after the effective date of this policy and is authorized to commute to his/her home and actually resides in and maintains his/her primary residence outside of the city limits, but no further than ten miles from the nearest point of the city limits, that employee may, at the option of the employee, use a city vehicle assigned to him or her to commute to and from that residence to and from the place of his or her city employment, provided: 
a.  The employee executes a written contract with the city by which the employee agrees that he or she will compensate the city by payroll deduction for the actual vehicle operation cost which costs shall be the same as the mileage allowance specified by the Internal Revenue Service and shall be based upon the travel to which the vehicle is exposed from the nearest boundary of the circle described in subsection (o)(1) to the place of primary residence described herein. The form and substance of this contract may be changed from time to time upon direction of the mayor, the mayor's administrative assistant or the city attorney. 
b.  The employee accepts the prorated cost assessment on a month to month basis and renews, signs, acknowledges and agrees to the payment of same, as fixed, determined and calculated by the mayor's administrative assistant or other designee of the mayor or administrative assistant. 
(3)  If any employee who is described in subsection (1) of this section should remove his or her primary residence outside of the circle established in subsection (o)(1) and said employee is authorized to use a city vehicle, he or she shall have the use of a city vehicle to commute to his or her primary residence only when he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of subsection (o)(2) and other applicable provisions of this policy. 
(4)  The portion of this section relating to reimbursement by the employee for use as described in subsection (o)(2) shall be effective on November 1, 2002. 
    To determine if the employee who resides outside of the city limits actually resides within ten miles of the city limits, measurements shall be made by determining travel distance from a point of the city limits nearest to the employee's primary residence which is accessible by state, parish or local road and determining the travel distance by state, parish or local road to the place of residence. 
    Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize the use of a city vehicle by an employee to commute to any residence that may be maintained by an employee which is further than ten miles from the city limits. For the purpose of determining whether the employee maintains his or her primary residence within an area prescribed by this section, factors to be considered include: (1) the employee's voting place, (2) the name under which utilities at the residence are registered, (3) the existence of a lease, (4) the ownership of the residence, (5) the occupancy actually occurring at the residence, (6) the actual residence of members of the employee's immediate family, and (7) the name under which telephone service to the residence is registered. 
    If it is determined that an employee claims that a place to which the employee commutes with a vehicle is in fact not his or her primary residence, then the employee shall forfeit the right to use the vehicle to commute. Any misrepresentation of fact by the employee concerning his or her primary residence will be documented in the employee's personnel folder and reported to the employee's appointing authority or, in the case of a non-classified employee, to the mayor. 
    All employees, whether they reside in the city limits or within an area outside of the city limits, who are authorized to use a vehicle to commute to and from their place of city employment in a city vehicle shall ascertain that the vehicle is kept in a secure location on the premises of their primary residence when it is not in use, free from access to the general public. If it is determined that the vehicle is not being maintained in a secure area while located upon the employee's premises the right of the employee to the use of the vehicle to commute shall be revoked. 
    Except as authorized by this policy, no other personal use of a city vehicle by an employee, whether in the classified service or not, shall be permitted, unless such use is necessary to prevent or protect against grave and imminent danger to life. This policy shall not supercede any provision of the Home Rule Charter for the City of Zachary or any ordinance pertaining to the use of vehicles for elected officials. 
(p)  There is hereby established an accident review committee, the members of which shall be the chief of police or the chief's designee, the fire chief, and the director of the department of public works. The city's safety officer shall be the ex-officio chairman of the committee but shall not have a vote in the committee. The committee shall also consist of up to two citizens of the city chosen by the employee whose actions are under review, if the employee desires to make such appointments. These citizens must have been certified as having completed a defensive driving course. It shall be the responsibility of any employee to report any accident, no matter how slight, to the member of the accident review committee having direct supervision over that employee. If any member of the accident review committee is involved in an accident the remainder of the committee shall review the facts and circumstances of the accident. Official action against an elected official for the accident may be considered by the council. Action by the committee may be taken as set forth in subsection (r)(1) of this section. The committee does not have the power to review accidents occurring while an employee is operating a vehicle during an emergency operation. 
(q)  The mayor or his designee is hereby authorized and directed to establish policies and procedures to keep a list of city vehicles, drivers and other pertinent information updated. All computerized vehicle records shall be consistent in department number, vehicle number, and any other shared information. A yearly report of the city owned vehicles in all departments shall be provided along with other inventory to the city council. Special provisions shall apply to undercover police and fire units which provisions are to be approved by the mayor. 
(r)  (1)  Any employee involved in any accident while operating a city vehicle that is ruled as a chargeable accident or a preventable accident by the city accident review committee shall be required to complete a driver safety improvement program and may face disciplinary proceedings where appropriate at the discretion of the employee's appointing authority or in the case of nonclassified personnel at the discretion of the mayor. Each time an employee is involved in a chargeable or preventable accident, the employee must complete additional programs as directed by the accident review committee. The program courses must be completed on the employee's personal time and at the employee's expense. Proof of completion of the programs must be submitted to the committee within 15 days of the employee's receipt of notice to complete the driver improvement program or any other additional program, as a condition of the employee's continued use of a city vehicle. 
(2)  All accidents involving city vehicles must be immediately reported from the scene by the employee to the proper law enforcement agency and the Zachary Police Department who shall inform the mayor or if unavailable, the mayor's administrative assistant. A complete written accident report must be filed by the employee with employee's department within five days of the accident. Failure of an employee in one of the city's classified systems to report the accident or to complete the written report shall be considered a violation of this policy, and may be considered grounds for discipline of that employee by the appropriate appointing authority. A nonclassified employee may be subject to discipline or dismissal by the mayor. 
(3)  Any city employee who is involved in an accident while operating a city vehicle shall be tested for controlled dangerous substances and alcohol in accordance with the Zachary Code of Ordinances, chapter 2, section 2-482, et seq. 
(s)  (1)  Traffic, parking and speed laws, while operating city vehicles, shall be obeyed at all times and the driver of the vehicle shall pay any fine assessed for violation of same. The provisions of this section pertaining to the observance of traffic, parking and speed laws are not applicable to the bona fide and legitimate emergency operation of a city vehicle (such as police units, fire trucks, or EMS vehicles) in accordance with the standard operating procedure of the department to which the vehicle is assigned or in conformity with state laws governing emergency response by public vehicles. 
(2)  If any employee who drives a city vehicle is convicted of a moving violation, or a violation of a criminal statute arising from the use of a city vehicle or his or her personal vehicle, regardless of whether the offense was committed on or off duty, such conviction shall be considered a violation which could result in elimination or restriction of the ability of the employee to operate or use a city vehicle. 
(3)  If an employee commits three or more moving violations, except for those listed in subsection (4) of this subsection, within a 12-month period, of which he/she is ultimately convicted, the employee must complete a driver safety improvement program. Each time the employee accumulates three new convictions for such violations within any twelve-month period, the employee must complete an additional program. This course must be completed on the employee's personal time and at the employee's expense. Proof of completion of the program must be submitted to the mayor's office within 15 days of the third conviction, as a condition of continued use of a city vehicle. 
(4)  Any employee who commits one driving while intoxicated offense while under the influence of alcohol or of a controlled dangerous substance offense or one negligent vehicular injuring or death offense while operating a city vehicle or his or her personal vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or of a controlled dangerous substance, for which he/she is ultimately convicted, the employee shall be barred from the operation or use of a city vehicle, subject to the provision of subsection (x)(2). Appointing authorities shall commence disciplinary action against any member of the classified civil service who violates this subsection. 
(t)  For purposes of this policy, a "conviction" shall include conviction by judge or jury and any charges wherein a guilty plea or a "no contest" plea was entered, even if the charges were subsequently dismissed pursuant to Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 892.1, 893 or 894 or other similar provision; it is the fact of the conviction which is the relevant circumstance to be considered in determining whether the vehicle use should be denied to an employee. 
(u)  City employees driving city vehicles will be held responsible for the cost of damage and repair for the unauthorized use of the vehicle. 
(v)  (1)  Any city employee who drives a city vehicle must notify the department or agency head, immediately, but in no event later than four hours, whichever occurs first, if on duty, or if off duty, within 72 hours or before reporting for work, whichever occurs first, 
a.  If his/her driver's license is revoked or suspended; 
b.  If he/she is arrested or cited for driving a vehicle while intoxicated, or operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled dangerous substance; or 
c.  If he/she is arrested or cited for negligent injury or death of another person, due to operation of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or of a controlled dangerous substance, beginning 30 days after the effective date of this policy. 
(2)  Notification must take place within 72 hours or before reporting for work, whichever occurs first, if an employee is convicted of a moving violation, regardless of whether notification has previously taken place regarding the arrest or citation for the offense in accordance with the requirements of subsection (v)(1), beginning 30 days after the effective date of this policy (Aug. 13, 2002). 
(3)  If the employee fails to timely report any of the foregoing occurrences, the employee must complete a driver safety improvement program. Each time the employee fails to timely report a new occurrence, the employee must complete an additional program. This course must be completed on the employee's personal time and at the employee's expense. As a condition of continued use of a city vehicle, proof of completion of the program must be submitted to the mayor for his review and decision within 15 days of receipt of written notice by the employee from the mayor that it has been determined that he/she has failed to timely report an occurrence. 
(w)  An employee convicted of three moving violations (not related to alcohol or drug use) or preventable accident violations within a 12-month period, while acting within the course and scope of his/her employment, on the first offense shall forfeit the privilege of driving the vehicle to his or her residence for seven days; on the second offense the employee shall forfeit driving the vehicle home for 30 days; and on the third offense the employee shall forfeit driving the vehicle home for one year. 
(x)  (1)  Any violation of the provisions of this policy may subject the employee to disciplinary action by the appointing authority which shall be in addition to any of the consequences stated herein. 
(2)  Employment that is dependent on the operation of a city vehicle shall result in suspension of the employee from duty without pay, if his or her driving privileges are suspended or revoked or his or her use of a city vehicle is curtailed, suspended or revoked as a result of this policy or the violations of traffic and criminal laws, provided, however, that the employee may use accrued vacation. At the discretion of any appointing authority any employee may be allowed to use accumulated sick leave during the period of the suspension without pay. Any employee whose suspension exceeds accumulated vacation or sick leave (without pay) where use thereof is allowed by the appointing authority may be subject to termination of employment. 
(y)  A copy of this policy shall be placed in all city vehicles. Each city employee must read and sign a statement that the employee has read and/or understands the provisions of this policy and that the employee agrees to abide by the provision thereof as a condition for the use of a city vehicle, specifically acknowledging and agreeing that periodic checks may be made of the employee's official driving record at the discretion of the mayor.

DIVISION 2. - DRUG TESTING POLICY AND PROCEDURE 

Sec. 2-482. - Purpose and general policy statement. 
    In an effort to promote and maintain a safe, healthful, productive and efficient environment and work place for all of its employees and the public which they serve, the city adopts a policy against drug abuse, and places in effect a testing program for employees, as is more particularly outlined below. To accomplish this purpose, the city does hereby prohibit the possession, use, distribution or sale of illegal drugs on the city premises or by any on-duty employee. Any employee reporting for work in a condition caused by off-duty use of drugs or controlled substances, which detrimentally affects his ability to perform work, shall be deemed in violation of this division, and subject to disciplinary action. In general, this policy is intended to eliminate any type of substance which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, sub-standard work performance, poor employee morale or promotion of a negative public image. It is intended also that this procedure be in conformity with R.S. 23:1601(10).

(d)  Any notice served pursuant to this section shall be filed with the recorder of mortgages where the property is located. Once filed, said notice shall be deemed notice to all subsequent transferees.

(a)  After the hearing, if, in the opinion of the council, the facts justify it, an order shall be entered condemning the building or structure and ordering that it be demolished or removed within a certain delay period. If repairs will correct the dilapidated, dangerous or unsafe condition, the council may grant the owner the option of making such repairs, but in such a case, the general nature or extent of the repairs to be made, the time thereof, and the defects to be corrected, shall be specified in the decision of the council. It shall be mandatory for the mayor to proceed with the demolition of the condemned structure not later than 30 days after the expiration of the delays permitted by the written decision and order of the council for the owner to either repair or demolish the subject building or structure, as set forth in section 14-41 of the city Code.

Where a grave public emergency has been declared by the governing authority, the owner of the building or structure who desires to prevent demolition or removal thereof, must file his petition within 48 hours and must, at the time of the filing of the petition, furnish such bond as may be fixed by the judge to cover any damage that might be caused by the condition of the building or structure.

(Code 1987, § 5-17; Ord. of 6-24-1980)

(a)  The owner or his designated agent may proceed to demolish and remove the building or structure, or have it repaired, in accordance with the order of the council, provided the owner or his agent executes a contract in writing obligating himself to have the work done within the required time and filed with the mayor a copy of the contract, together with a bond to guarantee performance. 
(b)  In the event the owner or occupant of the building or structure fails or refuses to comply with the decision of the council and fails to appeal therefrom within the legal delays provided herein, the mayor may proceed with the demolition or removal of the condemned building or structure, in which case neither the mayor nor the city shall be liable in damages. 
(c)  Prior to the demolition or removal of the building or structure by the city, the mayor or some official designated by him shall serve notice on the owner or his agent and on the occupant of the building, if any there be, or upon the attorney-at-law appointed to represent any owner who is a minor, interdicted or an absentee owner, giving the time when work will begin upon the demolition or removal of the building or structure.

Sec. 14-42. - Lien rights in favor of the city. 
(a)  The city has a privilege and lien upon an immovable and its improvements and the owner is personally liable for: 
(1)  The cost to the city of maintenance of the immovable or improvements; and 
(2)  The cost to the city of demolishing or removing, or both, a building or other structure situated upon the immovable or improvements, and all attorney fees incurred by the city in connection with such demolition or removal. 
(b)  The term "maintenance" shall include but not be limited to grass cutting, weed abatement, and trash and garbage removal. 
(c)  The privilege and lien shall be preserved and enforced only after the owner has refused, after notification by the city and reasonable opportunity to be heard, to pay the costs incurred by the city. 
(d)  The privilege and lien shall be preserved by the filing and recording of an affidavit signed by the mayor or his designee in the mortgage office of the parish in which the immovable is situated. The affidavit shall include a description of the property sufficient to reasonably identify the immovable and a statement of facts listing the approximate cost or costs incurred by the city. 
(e)  The privilege and lien shall be enforced by ordinary process in the district court having jurisdiction of the immovable within three years after it is perfected. Alternatively, the privilege and lien may be enforced by assessing the amount of the privilege and lien against the immovable as a tax against the immovable, to be enforced and collected as any ordinary property tax lien to be assessed against the property; said lien and privilege may be collected in the manner fixed for collection of taxes and shall be subject to the same civil penalties for delinquencies. After the city has incurred such costs as constitute the lien and privilege on the property, the mayor may send an attested bill of said costs and expenses which constitute the lien and privilege to the clerk or director of administration, who shall add the amount of said bill to the next tax bill of the owner. The lien obtained by the city pursuant to proper notification and filing shall include not only the costs provided for in subsection (a) of this section but shall include all attorney's fees and/or all costs of court incurred in the locating of the owner, the notification of the owner, and the enforcement and collection of the amount secured by the lien against the immovable and the improvements. 
(f)  The city may also recover interest on the amounts secured by the lien. The interest shall not exceed the rate of legal interest provided in C.C. art. 2924 and shall be computed from the date of recordation of the lien until paid. The city's privilege and lien shall prime all other liens or privileges against the property filed after the notice to the owner to show cause is filed with the recorder of mortgages pursuant to R.S. 33:4762(D), regardless of the date on which the city's lien and privilege is perfected, except that the city's lien and privilege will not prime other tax liens against the property. 
(g)  The lien shall not be canceled until after payment of all amounts, including costs, attorney fees, and interest. 
(h)  In addition to the lien and enforcement procedures authorized under this section, the city has a cause of action against the owner personally for the costs incurred by the city, if such owner is not indigent and has the ability to pay a judgment obtained by the city. Such action may be brought by ordinary proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(i)  (1)  If property, which may be subject to a lien and privilege granted in favor of the city under this section, is owned in indivision and the owners in indivision, with their proportionate share in the property, are listed separately by the tax assessor on the ad valorem tax roll for the city, then the city shall notify each owner in indivision of his liability under this section. 
(2)  Upon failure of each owner in indivision to pay his proportionate share of the charges incurred under this section, that part of the property for which the charges are not paid shall be subject to a lien and privilege in favor of the city as provided in this section. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f) to the contrary, upon payment by an owner in indivision of his proportionate share listed on the ad valorem tax roll for the city of the charges, attorney fees, and interest incurred under this section, and after certification of such proportionate interest by the assessor, the lien and privilege granted under this section shall be removed from the proportionate interest of the paying owner in indivision. If outstanding charges levied under this section are added to the annual ad valorem tax bill, the proportionate payment by the paying owner in indivision shall be reflected on the bill and his interest in the property free of such charge shall be distinguished on the tax bill. 
(4)  Notice of the lien and privilege required herein shall be made upon the owners in indivision at their actual address or the last known address listed to the tax rolls of the parish. 
(Code 1987, § 5-19)

(Ord. No. 1996-08, 5-28-1996) 
Sec. 14-66. - Abatement process. 
(a)  Before the enforcing agency may take steps to abate the nuisance through remedial measures, it must obtain approval from the city council.

The mayor shall thereupon serve notice on the owner of the swimming pool or his agent requiring him to show cause at a meeting of the city council, regular or special, why the remedial measures should not be executed. The date and hour of the meeting shall be stated in the notice which shall be served at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing, except in case of grave public emergency as hereinafter provided.

ARTICLE V. - FRANCHISES 

Sec. 18-101. - Findings. 
    The city makes and adopts the following findings and purposes: 
(1)  The city recognizes that it holds its property and the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to acquire, build, and maintain the rights-of-way. It also recognizes that some persons, by placing their equipment in the rights-of-way and charging the citizens of the city for goods and services delivered thereby, are profiting from their use of this property held by the city for the public good; 
(2)  The city's rights-of-way are owned or held by the city primarily for the purpose of pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the city's provision of essential public safety services, including police, fire, and emergency medical response services; and public health services, including sanitary sewer, water, and storm drainage services (together, "public uses"); 
(3)  Public uses should in all cases be considered and treated as the dominant and preeminent uses of public property and rights-of-way; 
(4)  All other uses of public rights-of-way, including use for the provision of business operations, must be subordinate to public uses; 
(5)  In order to provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of its rights-of-way and the city-owned facilities located therein, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances; 
(6)  Right-of-way obstructions and deterioration disrupt the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and are a source of frustration for merchants, business owners and the general population; 
(7)  The Louisiana legislature enacted Act 433 of 2008, codified as R.S. 45:1361-45:1378 as the "Consumer Choice for Television Act," which provides for a state-issued certificate of franchise authority for cable and video services. In R.S. 45:1374, the legislature reserved to local government certain authority to regulate the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority including the city's lawful exercise of its police powers; and 
(8)  In order for the city to properly protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, to enhance the public uses, and manage and maintain its property, it is appropriate and necessary that the city obtain and maintain current, accurate information concerning the location, construction, installation and maintenance of structures, facilities, and equipment occupying city property for business operations ("system"). 
(9)  Some entities conduct business operations utilizing city property and rights-of-way authorized by a fully executed, valid franchise agreement or ordinance with the city which addresses, among other matters, maintenance and use of city property and rights-of-way. The city has determined that it is in the public's best interest to honor said franchise agreements or ordinances and exempt from the application of this article the business operations specifically authorized by such agreements or ordinances.

(2)  The city recognizes and reserves any and all rights available to it to regulate use of any city property. 
(3)  The granting of any city license, permit, or other requirement for doing business within the city shall not be construed as authorizing any such person or entity the right to utilize city property for the conduct of business operations.

(c)  Relocation at request of the city. If the city shall lawfully elect to vacate, relocate, abandon, alter, reconstruct or change any city property, the permittee, upon 30 days' written notice by the city via certified mail to the permittee, shall remove, re-lay and relocate its structure, equipment, and facilities at its own expense.

This section shall not apply to emergency repair projects or utility service extension projects which the permittee could not have anticipated. 
(8)  The permittee shall keep all of the information required by subsection (4) current at all times by immediately providing the city written notice of changes. 
(9)  Any person or entity whose system occupies city property for business operations without obtaining the permit required in this article; who fails to provide the 72-hour notice prior to commencement of construction, installation, or maintenance activities as required in subsection (6); or who fails to maintain current, accurate information required by subsection (4) concerning any system occupying city property may have any permit granted pursuant to this article revoked and may be denied future authorization for construction, installation, or maintenance activities for a period of two years. 
(10)  Any violation of this article shall afford the city the full range of remedies available under any applicable law or regulation including the levying of fines. The election of one or more remedies shall not be construed as a waiver of any other legal and/or equitable remedy including, but not limited to the city's right to seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees as the law might allow.

ARTICLE III. - HAZARDOUS WASTES 

Sec. 38-67. - Definition. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Hazardous waste includes, but is not limited to, such items as petroleum waste; paints; plastics; explosives; acids; caustics; chemicals; poisons; drugs; radioactive materials; asbestos fibers; pathogenic wastes from hospitals, sanitariums, nursing homes, clinics and veterinary hospitals, offal waste and the like, which by virtue of their particular composition and inherent dangers, require handling and disposal methods different from those used in other waste materials. In the way of further explanation, the term "hazardous waste" is solid waste, be it infectious, explosive, poisonous, caustic or toxic, or otherwise dangerous or injurious to humans, plant or animal life. Residential solid waste normally contains some hazardous materials, but because such materials are usually present in very small quantities, their safe disposal either in a sanitary landfill or incinerator presents no special problem. Therefore, residential waste is not considered to be "hazardous waste" as used in this text.

Sec. 38-68. - Disposal prohibited.

ARTICLE IV. - JUNKED VEHICLES 

Sec. 38-85. - Intent. 
    This article is enacted in recognition of the fact that junk and/or abandoned cars that are stored on private property or discarded in public places can constitute both a public and private nuisance. They are a source of potential harm to children and others who may find them to be an attractive nuisance. They create safety and health hazards including, but not limited to, fire hazards due to gasoline remaining in tanks of a highly explosive combustible nature, harmful acid in batteries, broken glass, and sharp, torn, metal edges and points. These junk or abandoned vehicles constitute a blight on the city's landscape which destroy the aesthetic qualities of the city, hurting the welfare of the city as a whole. They reduce the value not only of the property upon which they are located but also of the property surrounding. The conditions of these vehicles may also tend to impede traffic in the streets and invite plundering.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 46-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Louisiana has in statute R.S. 38:84 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Zachary (the "city"), Louisiana, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Rivervine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area. See area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) [of National Flood Insurance Program Regulations] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-49. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-23, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 46-38 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

Sec. 46-50. - Floodways. 
    Floodways. located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-23, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 46-50(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by section 65.12 [National Flood Insurance Program Regulation].

(2)  For those properties located in zone X, on the FIRM map described in subsection 46-51(1), the minimum lowest floor elevation shall meet or exceed each of the following levels: one foot above the nearest adjacent FIRM base flood elevation, one foot above the centerline of the street, and one foot above the nearest upstream or downstream sanitary sewer manhole. 
(3)  The requirements set forth in subsections 46-51(1), (2) requiring that the minimum lowest floor elevation be one foot above the center line of the street shall not apply when the city approved drainage schematic contemplates that: 
a.  The street pavement will not serve as the drainage collector system; or 
b.  Drainage will not be conveyed toward the street. 
(4)  In lieu of the requirements regarding sanitary sewer manholes set forth in subsections 46-51(1) and (2) above the lowest floor elevation may be lower than one foot but not lower than six inches above the top of the nearest upstream and downstream sanitary sewer manhole, if all of the following requirements are met: 
a.  A sanitary sewer backwater check valve and a sewer cleanout shall be installed in the building sanitary sewer line and located on the applicant's property but outside of the street right-of-way and utility servitudes; 
b.  Shall meet plumbing code requirements; 
c.  The property owner shall be responsible for perpetually maintaining the sanitary sewer backwater check valve in proper operating condition;

This agreement shall be recorded by the clerk of court in the conveyance records and a certified copy with the recording data and filing date, shall be furnished to the City of Zachary Building Official before a building permit will be issued. 
e.  All the provisions of this subsection are met and approval is given by the Zachary City Engineer and the floodplain administrator. 
(5)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit a registered civil engineer, surveyor or architect shall submit written certification to the City of Zachary that the minimum floor elevations required by this chapter have been satisfied. 
(6)  Use of landfill material restricted for construction of structures: 
a.  Except as provided hereafter, in areas of special flood hazard, no off-site landfill material shall be allowed except for: 
1.  Backfill required for chain wall construction. This exemption shall apply to structures of 5,000 square feet or less contained within the footprint of the structure. 
2.  Building pads for residential structures, mobile homes and pier column construction. The building pad must be transitioned back to natural grade within five feet of the outside limits of the footprint of the elevated structure. 
3.  Transition of driveways into garages. The transition distance shall extend only through the limits of the structure. The driveway, from the street connection to the start of the transition, shall be constructed in such a manner that the finished driveway grade is at or below the natural grade prior to construction. Appropriate drainage facilities must be provided to prevent the redirection of run-off water onto adjacent properties or the blockage of surface sheet run-off. 
    If any additional mitigation is done (excavation, digging a pond or lake, altering drainage, etc.) subsection 46-53(1) shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-52. - Structures on piers shall not impede the flow of water. 
    For new construction or any type of structure on piers and for any new substantial improvement of any structure placed on piers, there shall be no enclosed space beneath the lowest floor. Coverings such as screens and lattice work may be used to hide these openings but all materials used to create or build such coverings must permit the free and uninhibited flow of floodwaters throughout the cavity. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-53. - Use of landfill material restricted for development. 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided, no fill shall be permitted in areas of special flood hazard unless the fill is mitigated by excavation and meets the following requirements: 
No encroachments, including fill for landfill or other purposes, new construction, substantial improvements or other type of developments, may be placed unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed encroachments will not decrease the existing volume storage capacity, based upon the base flood elevation within the boundaries of the proposed development or encroachment site located within the area of special flood hazard. Additionally, encroachment shall not increase the existing calculated base flood elevation. A technical evaluation shall include any one or a combination of the following methods: 
a.  For developments with proposed on-site fill and excavation construction (no imported or off-site fill), a before and after development construction grading plan shall be provided to show no decrease in the existing flood volume storage capacity, below the base flood elevation established for the site. 
b.  Fill shall not be used to restrict the existing channel cross-sectional area. For channels with intermittent flow, the excavation site shall drain to the existing adjacent channel. 
c.  For channels with continuous flow, the excavation sites shall drain to the existing channel. 
d.  No credit shall be given, for mitigation purposes, for that portion of the excavation which is lower than the existing channel. 
(2)  For developments requiring imported or off-site fill, in addition to the excavation, grading and fill requirements outlined above, approved engineering methodologies such as the methods shown in the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development Hydraulics Manual shall be used to make a before and after development analysis of the proposed site, including its off-site drainage areas, to show the increased runoff for a 100-year storm event. The existing 100-year storm channel flow, the calculated base flood elevation and the hydraulic grade line for the channel at the downstream end of the proposed site will be required. One or more of the following methods may be used, unless otherwise approved by the engineering division for the city: 
a.  A rating curve analysis shall be made of the channel to show that the water surface for a 100-year storm event resulting from the proposed development or landfill does not increase the calculated base flood elevation. 
b.  If the imported or off-site fill is taken from the channel (within the proximity of or within 1/2 mile upstream of the proposed development or landfill site), an inflow-outflow flood routing analysis of the proposed borrow site on the channel shall be made to show that the adverse effect of increased runoff from the 100-year storm event due to the proposed development or landfill site is balanced by the beneficial effects of the increased storage provided by the borrow site. 
c.  If the imported or off-site fill is taken elsewhere, approved engineering methodologies shall be used to show that the water surface elevation resulting from the proposed development or landfill does not increase the base flood elevation. 
(3)  If downstream channel improvements are included as part of the proposed development or landfill, engineering calculations shall be made to show that the adverse effects of increased runoff from a 100-year storm event due to the proposed development is offset by the beneficial effects of the proposed channel improvements. Any permissible use of off-site landfill material, as provided in this flood damage prevention chapter or Federal Floodplain Management Standards shall be subject to the provisions of such chapter and flood standards. No building shall be constructed over an existing identified natural drain as determined by the department of public works. The surface of parking lots, and private streets in subdivisions of more than five lots, shall not be constructed lower than six inches below the FIRM base flood elevation or record inundation, whichever is greater.

Sec. 46-54. - Prohibiting dumping and depositing material in the rivers, creeks, bayous, canals, ditches and lakes. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to throw away, deposit or discard any refuse, paper, trash, glass, nails, tacks, wire, bottles, cans, yard trash, concrete, earthen fill, garbage, containers, litter, debris, or toxic substances or hazardous waste material in any ditches, streams, rivers, lakes, bayous, canals, or retention basin that regularly or periodically carries surface water runoff. Any person who deposits any of the above may be required to remove it there from immediately and shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 46-56 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-55. - Severability. 
    Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction or authority for any reason, the remainder of said chapter shall remain in full force and effect with the provisions of this chapter being hereby declared severable such that said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2012-04, 4-10-2012) 
Sec. 46-56. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $1000.00 or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 58-1. - Reserved. 
Sec. 58-2. - Definitions.

    Another means any other person or legal entity, including the state or any subdivision thereof. 
    Anything of value must be given the broadest possible construction, including any conceivable thing of the slightest value, movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, public or private, and including transportation, telephone and telegraph services, or any other service available for hire. It must be construed in the broad popular sense of the phrase, not necessarily as synonymous with the traditional legal term "property." In all cases involving shoplifting, the term "value" is the actual retail price of the property at the time of the offense. 
    Dangerous weapon includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm. 
    Felony means any crime for which an offender may be sentenced to death or imprisonment at hard labor. 
    Foreseeable refers to that which ordinarily would be anticipated by a human being of average reasonable intelligence and perception.

    Person includes a human being from the moment of fertilization and implantation, and also includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not. 
    Property means both public and private property, movable and immovable, and corporeal and incorporeal property. 
    Public officer, public office, public employee and position of public authority mean and apply to any executive, ministerial, administrative, judicial or legislative officer, office, employee or position of authority respectively, of the state or any parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision thereof, or of any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state or any parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    State means the State of Louisiana, or any parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision thereof, or any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state or any parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    Unborn child means any individual of the human species from fertilization and implantation until birth. 
    Whoever, in a penalty clause, refers only to natural persons insofar as death or imprisonment is provided, but insofar as a fine may be imposed the term "whoever" in a penalty clause refers to any person. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:2. 
Sec. 58-3. - Interpretation of provisions defining crimes. 
    The sections of this Code cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not provided for in this Code; however, in order to promote justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:3. 
Sec. 58-4. - Prosecution of conduct made criminal under several sections. 
    Prosecution may proceed under either provision, in the discretion of the city prosecutor, whenever an offender's conduct is: 
(1)  Criminal according to a section of this chapter; or 
(2)  Criminal according to some other provision of this Code or some special ordinance. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:4. 
Sec. 58-5. - Lesser and included offenses. 
    An offender who commits an offense which includes all the elements of other lesser offenses may be prosecuted for and convicted of either the greater offense or one of the lesser and included offenses. In such case, where the offender is prosecuted for the greater offense, he may be convicted of any one of the lesser and included offenses. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:5. 
Sec. 58-6. - Civil remedies; penalties for contempt. 
    Nothing in this Code shall affect any civil remedy provided by the law pertaining to civil matters, or any legal power to inflict penalties for contempt. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:6. 
ARTICLE II. - ELEMENTS OF CRIMES 

Sec. 58-7. - Crime defined. 
    A crime is that conduct which is defined as criminal in this Code, or in acts of the state legislature, or in the constitution of the state. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:7. 
Sec. 58-8. - Criminal conduct. 
    Criminal conduct consists of: 
(1)  An act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences, and which is combined with criminal intent; 
(2)  A mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences, where there is no requirement of criminal intent; or 
(3)  Criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:8. 
Sec. 58-9. - Criminal consequences. 
    Criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this Code or in the acts of the legislature of the state as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:9. 
Sec. 58-10. - Specific and general criminal intent. 
    Criminal intent may be specific or general. 
(1)  Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. 
(2)  General criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent, and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender, in the ordinary course of human experience, must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:10. 
Sec. 58-11. - Expression of criminal intent. 
    The definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent, while in others no intent is required. Some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. However, in the absence of qualifying provisions, the terms "intent" and "intentional" have reference to general criminal intent. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:11. 
Sec. 58-12. - Criminal negligence. 
    Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful person under like circumstances. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:12. 
ARTICLE III. - CULPABILITY 

Sec. 58-13. - Infancy. 
    Those who have not reached the age of ten years are exempt from criminal responsibility. However, nothing in this article shall affect the jurisdiction of juvenile courts as established by the constitution and statutes of this state. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:13. 
Sec. 58-14. - Insanity. 
    If the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:14. 
Sec. 58-15. - Intoxication. 
    The fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial, except as follows: 
(1)  Where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary, and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime, the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility. 
(2)  Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:15. 
Sec. 58-16. - Mistake of fact. 
    Unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime, reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:16. 
Sec. 58-17. - Mistake of law. 
    Ignorance of the provisions of this Code or of any criminal statute is not a defense to any criminal prosecution. However, mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Where the offender reasonably relied on the act of the council or the state legislature in repealing an existing criminal provision, or in otherwise purporting to make the offender's conduct lawful; or 
(2)  Where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:17. 
Sec. 58-18. - Justification generally. 
    The fact that an offender's conduct is justifiable, although otherwise criminal, shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct. This defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances: 
(1)  When the offender's conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office; 
(2)  When the offender's conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest that is lawful under the Code of Criminal Procedure; 
(3)  When for any reason the offender's conduct is authorized by law; 
(4)  When the offender's conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents, tutors or teachers; 
(5)  When the crime consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility; 
(6)  When any crime, except murder, is committed through the compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm, and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not committed; or 
(7)  When the offender's conduct is in defense of persons or of property under any of the circumstances described in sections 58-19 through 58-22. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:18. 
Sec. 58-19. - Use of force or violence in defense. 
    The use of force or violence upon the person of another is justifiable when committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a person's lawful possession; provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense, and that this section shall not apply where the force or violence results in a homicide. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:19. 
Sec. 58-20. - Reserved. 
Sec. 58-21. - Aggressor cannot claim self-defense.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:21. 
Sec. 58-22. - Defense of others. 
    It is justifiable to use force or violence or to kill in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used such means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary to protect the other person. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:22. 
ARTICLE IV. - PARTIES; INCHOATE OFFENSES 

Sec. 58-23. - Parties classified.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:23. 
Sec. 58-24. - Principals. 
    All persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether present or absent, and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime, are principals. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 14:24. 
Secs. 58-25, 58-26. - Reserved. 
Sec. 58-27. - Attempt. 
(a)  Any person who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose. 
(b)  Mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt, but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended. 
(c)  An attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended crime; and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime, although it appears on the trial that the crime intended or attempted was actually perpetrated by such person in pursuance of such attempt. 
(d)  Whoever attempts to commit any crime shall be punished as follows: 
(1)  If the offense so attempted is theft, or receiving stolen things, and is not punishable as a felony, he shall be fined not more than $200.00 or imprisoned for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(2)  In all other cases he shall be fined or imprisoned, or both, in the same manner as for the offense attempted. Such fine or imprisonment shall not exceed one-half of the largest fine, or one-half of the longest term of imprisonment, prescribed for the offense so attempted, or both.

Sec. 78-27. - Advertising agency exclusion. 
    It is not the intention of this article to levy a tax upon any advertising service rendered by an advertising business, including, but not limited to, advertising agencies, design firms, and print and broadcast media, or any member, agent, or employee thereof, to any client whether or not such service also involves a transfer to the client of tangible personal property. However, a transfer of mass-produced advertising items by an advertising business which manufactures the items itself to a client for the client's use, which transfer involves the furnishing of minimal services other than manufacturing services by the advertising business shall be a taxable sale or use of tangible personal property; however, in no event shall tax be levied on charges for creative services which are separately invoiced. 
Sec. 78-28. - Collection of tax from dealer. 
(a)  On all tangible personal property imported or caused to be imported from other states or other political subdivisions of this state or foreign country, and used by him, the dealer shall pay the tax imposed by this article on all articles of tangible personal property so imported and used, the same as if the articles had been sold at retail for use or consumption in the taxing jurisdiction. For the purpose of this article, the use, consumption, distribution, or storage of tangible personal property shall each be equivalent to a sale at retail and the tax shall thereupon immediately levy and be collected in the manner provided herein, provided there shall be no duplication of the tax in any event. 
(b)  (1)  It is not the intention of this article to levy a tax upon articles of tangible personal property imported into the taxing jurisdiction, or produced or manufactured in the taxing jurisdiction for export, nor is it the intention of this article to levy a tax on bona fide interstate commerce. It is, however, the intention of this article to levy a tax on the sale at retail, the use, the consumption, the distribution, and the storage, to be used or consumed in the taxing jurisdiction of tangible personal property after it has come to rest in the taxing jurisdiction and has become a part of the mass of property in the taxing jurisdiction. 
(2)  A credit against the use tax imposed by this article shall be granted to taxpayers who have paid a similar tax upon the sale or use of the same tangible personal property in another city or parish in the state, or in a city or county or other political subdivision in a state other than this state, the proof of the payment of such tax to be according to rules and regulations made by the director. The amount of the credit shall be calculated by multiplying the rate of the similar tax paid in the other taxing jurisdiction by the cost price of the tangible personal property at the time of its importation into this taxing jurisdiction. In no event shall the credit be greater than the tax imposed by this taxing jurisdiction upon the particular tangible personal property which is the subject of this taxing jurisdiction's use tax. 
(3)  Where taxes have been erroneously paid to another taxing jurisdiction, the provisions of Act 739 of 1990 [R.S. 33:2718.2(D) and (E)] shall be used to determine the applicability of the credit. 
(c)  Any provision of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, the tax herein levied on the sale or use of any motor vehicle, automobile, motorcycle, truck, truck-tractor, trailer, semitrailer, motor bus, house trailer, or any other vehicle subject to the vehicle registration license tax of the state, shall be collected as provided in this subsection. 
(1)  The director shall enter into an agreement by which the tax herein levied on any such vehicle shall be paid to the vehicle commissioner of the state at the time of application for a certificate of title or vehicle registration license. The sales tax levied by subsection (b) hereof on any such vehicles shall be due at the time registration or any transfer of registration is required by the vehicle registration license tax law (R.S. 47:451 et seq.). The use tax levied by subsection (b) hereof on the use of any such vehicle shall be due at the time the first registration in this state is required by the vehicle registration license tax law (R.S. 47:451 et seq.). 
(2)  Each vendor of a vehicle covered by the provisions hereof shall furnish to the purchaser at the time of sale a sworn statement showing the serial number, motor number, type, year and model of the vehicle sold; the total sales price, any allowances for, and a description of, any vehicle taken in trade, and the total cash difference paid, or to be paid by the purchaser between the vehicles purchased and traded in and the sales or use tax to be paid, along with such other information as the vehicle commissioner may, by regulation, require. All labor, parts, accessories and other equipment which are attached to the vehicle at the time of sale, and which are included in the sale price, are to be considered a part of the vehicle. 
(3)  It is not the intention of this subsection to grant an exemption from the tax levied by this article to any sale, use, item or transaction which has heretofore been taxable, and this subsection is not to be construed as so doing. It is the intention of this subsection to transfer the collection of the sales and use tax on vehicles from the vendor to the vehicle commissioner and to provide a method of collection of the tax directly from the vendee or user by the vehicle commissioner, as authorized in the case of state sales and use taxes by the provisions of Act 182 of 1962. 
(4)  The director is further authorized to promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary in order to carry out the terms and conditions of any agreement entered into with the vehicle commissioner for the purposes hereof. 
(d)  Auctioneers shall be responsible for the collection of all taxes on retail sales by them and shall report and remit such taxes as provided in this article. 
Sec. 78-29. - Collection of tax by dealer. 
(a)  (1)  The tax herein levied shall be collected by the dealer from the purchaser or consumer, except for the collection of tax on the lease or rental of property for use offshore as otherwise provided in this chapter. The dealer shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from the purchaser, or in respect to nonpayment of the tax by the purchaser, as if the tax were a part of the purchase price of the property or charges for services, and payable at the time of the sale; however, the taxing jurisdiction shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought by the dealer to collect the tax. 
(2)  Every dealer located outside the taxing jurisdiction making sales of tangible personal property for distribution, storage, use or other consumption in this taxing jurisdiction, shall at the time of making sales, collect the tax imposed by this article from the purchaser. 
(3)  Where the purchaser has failed to pay and a dealer has failed to collect a tax upon a sale as imposed by this article, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, such tax shall be payable by the purchaser directly to the taxing jurisdiction, and it shall be the duty of the purchaser to file a return thereof with the director and to pay the tax imposed thereon to the taxing jurisdiction within 15 days after such sale was made or rendered. 
(b)  (1)  The dealer shall, as far as practicable, add the exact amount of the tax imposed under this article, or the average equivalent thereof, in conformity with the rules and regulations to be issued by the director, to the sales price or charge, and when added, such tax shall constitute a part of such price or charge, and shall be a debt from the purchaser or consumer to the dealer, until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. Any dealer who shall neglect, fail or refuse to collect the tax herein provided upon any, every and all retail sales made by him or his agent or employee, which is subject to the tax imposed in this article, shall be liable for, and pay the tax himself. 
(2)  Where the tax collected for any period is in excess of the total amount of sales taxes imposed in the taxing jurisdiction, the total collected must be paid over to the taxing jurisdiction, less the commission to be allowed the dealer as hereinafter set forth. 
(c)  A person engaged in any business taxable under this article shall not advertise or hold out to the public in any manner, directly or indirectly, that he will absorb all or any part of the tax, or that he will relieve the purchaser from the payment of all or any part of the tax. 
(d)  The sums of money collected by the dealer for payment of any taxes imposed herein shall be and remain the property of the taxing jurisdiction. 
Sec. 78-30. - Certificate of authority. 
(a)  In order to aid in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article, and to collect all of the taxes imposed by this article, dealers purchasing or importing tangible personal property for resale commencing business after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived, or opening new places of business after such date, shall within three days after such commencement or opening file with the director a certificate of registration on a form prescribed by him. The director shall, within five days after such registration, issue without charge to each dealer who purchases or imports for resale a certificate of authority empowering such dealer to collect the tax from the purchaser, and duplicates thereof, for each additional place of business of such dealer. Each certificate or duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable. Such certificate of authority shall be prominently displayed in the places of business of the dealer. A dealer who has no regular place of doing business shall attach such certificate to his cart, stand, truck, or other merchandising device. Such certificate shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the director upon the dealers ceasing to do business at the place therein named. 
(b)  A wholesale dealer or jobber shall collect the tax imposed by this article unless the purchaser shall have filed a certificate of registration as prescribed herein and received a certificate of authority to collect the tax imposed by this article; however, the payment of the tax by such purchaser shall not relieve the purchaser of the duty hereunder imposed upon such purchaser to collect the tax upon any resale made by him. Such purchaser who shall thereafter file a certificate of registration and receive a certificate of authority to collect the tax may, upon application therefor, receive a refund of the taxes paid by him upon property thereafter resold by him, and upon the receipts from which he shall have collected and paid over to the taxing jurisdiction, the tax herein imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-31. - Import permits. 
(a)  In order to prevent the illegal importation of tangible personal property which is subject to the tax into the taxing jurisdiction and to strengthen and make more effective the manner and method of enforcing payment of the tax imposed by this article, the director is hereby authorized and empowered to put into operation a system of permits whereby any person or dealer may import tangible personal property by truck, automobile or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having the truck, automobile, or other means of transportation seized and subjected to legal proceedings for its forfeiture. Such system of permits shall require the person or dealer who desires to import tangible personal property into the taxing jurisdiction which property is subject to tax imposed by this article, to apply to the director for a permit stating the kind of vehicle to be used, the name of the driver, the license number of the vehicle, the kind or character of tangible personal property to be imported, the date, the name and address of the consignee, and such other information as the director may deem proper or necessary to prevent the illegal importation of tangible personal property into the taxing jurisdiction. Such permits shall be free of cost to the applicant and may be obtained at the office of the director. 
(b)  The importation into the taxing jurisdiction of tangible personal property which is subject to tax by truck, automobile or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having first obtained a permit as described hereinabove (if the tax imposed by this article on tangible personal property has not been paid) shall be construed as an attempt to evade payment of the tax and is hereby prohibited and the truck, automobile or means of transportation other than a common carrier, and taxable property may be seized by the taxing jurisdiction in order to secure the same as evidence in a trial, and shall be subject to forfeiture and sale in the manner provided for in this article. 
(c)  The failure of any dealer who imports tangible personal property from outside the taxing jurisdiction into the taxing jurisdiction for use or consumption or distribution or storage, to be used or consumed in the taxing jurisdiction, or who imports for lease or rental, any tangible personal property subject to the provisions of this article, to pay any tax, interest, penalties or costs under this article, shall ipso facto make the tax, interest, penalties and costs delinquent and shall be construed as an attempt to avoid their payment, which shall be sufficient grounds for attachment of such tangible personal property wherever it may be located or found, whether the delinquent dealer be a resident or nonresident of the taxing jurisdiction, and whether the tangible personal property be in the possession of the delinquent dealer or in the possession of other persons. It is the intention of this article to prevent the disposition of tangible personal property in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed by this article, together with interest, penalties and costs, and such authority to attach is hereby specifically authorized and granted to the taxing jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-32. - Returns and payments of tax; delinquent interest, penalty, attorneys fees; vendor's compensation. 
(a)  The taxes levied hereunder shall be due and payable on the first day of the month next following the month in which this article takes effect. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax payable under this article, it shall be the duty of all dealers, on or before the 20th day of the month following the month in which this tax shall become effective, to transmit to the taxing jurisdiction, upon forms prescribed, prepared and furnished by the director, returns showing the gross sales or purchases arising from all sales or purchases taxable under this article during the preceding calendar month, or during the part of the preceding calendar month, running from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived to the end of such month. Thereafter, like returns shall be prepared and transmitted to said director by all dealers on or before the 20th day of each month for the preceding calendar month. Such returns shall show further information as the director may require to enable him to correctly compute and collect the tax herein levied. Such returns shall be signed by the dealer filing the same and his signature thereon shall constitute a warranty on the part of the dealer that he has read and examined the returns and that to the best of his knowledge and belief, the same are true, correct and complete. Every dealer, at the time of making the return required hereunder, shall compute and remit to the taxing jurisdiction the required tax due for the preceding calendar month. 
(b)  The director may agree with a dealer to allow for quarterly reporting and remitting of the taxes under the sales and use tax ordinance when such taxes amount to $50.00 or less per month. 
(c)  The director may agree with a dealer to allow for the collection of sales taxes by the dealer from his particular independent agents, such tax to be remitted to the director. 
(d)  The director may agree with certain dealers or purchasers to accept their sales and use tax returns and remittances on an irregular basis, when past returns and knowledge of common business practice indicate to the director that the only tax liability is as a result of infrequent transactions upon which sales or use tax is due. 
(e)  For the purpose of compensating the dealer in accounting for and remitting the tax levied by this article, each dealer shall be allowed one percent of the amount of tax due and accounted for and remitted to the taxing jurisdiction in the form of a deduction in submitting his report and paying the amount due by him, provided the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment. 
(f)  At the time of transmitting the return required hereunder to the director, the dealer shall remit to the taxing jurisdiction therewith the amount of the tax due under the applicable provisions of this article, and failure to so remit such tax shall cause the tax to become delinquent. 
(g)  (1)  If the amount of tax due by the dealer is not paid on or before the 20th day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due, there shall be collected with said tax, interest upon said unpaid amount at the rate of 11/4 percent per month, or fractional part thereof. In addition there shall be collected a penalty equivalent to five percent per month, or fraction thereof, not to exceed 25 percent in aggregate, of the tax due, when such tax is not paid on or before the 20th day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due. Both interest and penalty will be computed from the first day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due. In the event of suit, attorney's fees will be charged the dealer at the rate of ten percent on the aggregate of tax, interest and penalty. All interest and penalties due for subsequent months will be assessed and due as of the first day of each succeeding month. The parish attorney is authorized to employ private counsel to assist in the collection of any sales and use taxes, penalties or interest due under this article, or to represent him in any proceeding under this article. 
(2)  All taxes, interest and penalties imposed under this article shall be paid to the taxing jurisdiction in the form of remittance required by the director. 
(3)  All penalties and interest imposed by this article shall be payable to and recoverable by the taxing jurisdiction in the same manner as if they were part of the tax imposed. If the failure to pay any such tax when due is explained to the satisfaction of the director, he may remit or waive payment of the whole, or any part, of any penalty, and may remit and waive payment of any interest charged in excess of the rate of 11/4 percent per month. 
(h)  For the purpose of collecting and remitting to the taxing jurisdiction the tax imposed by this article, the dealer is hereby declared to be the agent of the taxing jurisdiction. 
(i)  Anything to the contrary in this article notwithstanding, rental purchase agreements, as defined in Louisiana Act 204 of 1991, shall be deemed to be sales and the tax due on such transactions shall be payable in equal monthly installments over the entire term of the rental-purchase agreement, rather than at its inception. 
(j)  However, a person who leases or rents tangible personal property to customers who provide information to such person that they will use the property only offshore beyond the territorial limits of the state shall not be included in the term "dealer" for purposes of the collection of the rental or lease tax imposed by this article on such lease or rental contracts. For purposes of this subsection, "use" means the operational or functional use of the property and not other uses related to its possession such as transportation, maintenance, and repair. It is the intention of this subsection that the customers of such persons shall remit any tax due on the lease or rental of such property directly to the taxing jurisdiction. 
Sec. 78-33. - Records. 
(a)  Every dealer required to make a report or pay any tax under this article shall keep and preserve verifiable records of the sales, purchases or leases taxable under this article, and such other books of account as may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax due hereunder, and such other information as may be required by the director. Each dealer shall secure, maintain and keep, until the taxes to which they relate have prescribed, a complete record of tangible personal property received, used, sold at retail, distributed, or stored, leased or rented, within the taxing jurisdiction by such dealer, together with invoices, bills of lading, and other pertinent records and papers as may be required by the director for the reasonable administration of this article, and a complete record of all sales or purchases of services taxable under this article until the taxes to which they relate have prescribed. These records shall be open to examination by the director at all reasonable hours. 
(b)  All wholesale dealers and jobbers in the taxing jurisdiction shall keep and preserve verifiable records of all sales of tangible personal property in the taxing jurisdiction whether such sales be for cash or on terms of credit. These records shall include the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, the article purchased, and the price at which the article is sold to the purchaser. These records shall be kept until the taxes to which they relate have prescribed and shall be open to examination by the director at all reasonable hours. 
(c)  For the purpose of enforcing the collection of the tax levied by this article, the director is hereby specifically authorized and empowered to examine, at all reasonable hours, the books, records and other documents of all transportation companies, agencies or firms operating in the taxing jurisdiction, whether said companies, agencies or firms conduct their business by truck, rail, water, airplane, or otherwise, in order to determine what dealers, as provided in this article, are importing or are otherwise shipping articles of tangible personal property which are liable for said tax. In the event said transportation company, agency or firm shall refuse to permit such examination of its books, records and other documents by the director, as aforesaid, the director may proceed by rule, in term time or in chambers, in any court of competent jurisdiction and require said transportation company, agency or firm to show cause why the director should not be permitted to examine its books, records or other documents, and in case said rule be made absolute, the same shall be considered a judgment of the court and every violation of the judgment as a contempt thereof and punished according to law. 
Sec. 78-34. - Director's authority to examine and audit. 
(a)  For the purpose of administering this article, the director may make or cause to be made an examination or investigation of the place of business, if any, the tangible personal property, and the books, records, papers, vouchers, accounts, and documents of any dealer. It shall be the duty of every dealer and every director, official, agent or employee of every dealer, to exhibit to the director the tangible personal property and all of the books, records, papers, vouchers, accounts, and documents of the dealer and to facilitate any such examination or investigation, as far as it may be in his or their power so to do. 
(b)  It shall be lawful for the director to receive the written oath of any person signing any application, deposition, statement or report required by the director, in the administration of this article. 
(c)  The director may conduct hearings and have administered and examined under oath any dealer and the directors, officers, agents and employees of any dealer, and any other witnesses relative to the business of such dealer in respect to any matter incident to the administration of this article. Such examinations or hearings shall be at a time convenient to the dealer within 14 days after requested by the director in writing. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-35. - Director's authority to determine the tax. 
(a)  (1)  After a report or return is filed under the provisions of this article, the director shall cause to be made such further audit or investigation as he may deem necessary, and if therefrom he shall determine that there is a deficiency in respect to the payment of any tax due hereunder, he shall assess the additional penalties and interest due. The assessment so made shall be considered prima facie correct and the burden shall be on the dealer to show the contrary. 
(2)  In the event any dealer fails to make a report and pay the tax as provided by this article, or in case the dealer makes a grossly incorrect report or a report that is false or fraudulent, it shall be the duty of the director to make an estimate for the taxable period of the retail sales, or sales of services, of such dealer, or of the gross proceeds from rentals or leases of tangible personal property by the dealer, and an estimate of the cost price of all articles of tangible personal property imported by the dealer for use or consumption or distribution or storage, to be used or consumed in the taxing jurisdiction, and assess and collect the tax and interest, plus penalty, if such have accrued, on the basis of such assessment, which shall be considered prima facie correct, and the burden to show the contrary shall rest upon the dealer. 
(b)  In the event the dealer has imported the tangible personal property and he fails to produce an invoice showing the cost price of the articles which are subject to tax, or the invoice does not reflect the true or actual cost price, the director shall ascertain, in any manner feasible, the true cost price and assess and collect the tax with interest, plus penalties, if such have accrued, on the true cost price as assessed by him. The assessment so made shall be considered prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the dealer to show the contrary. 
(c)  In the case of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, if the consideration given or reported by the dealer does not, in the judgment of the director, represent the true or actual consideration, then the director may fix the same and collect the tax thereon for the taxing jurisdiction in the same manner as above provided, with interest, plus penalties, if such have accrued. 
(d)  All taxes, penalties and interest assessed pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be paid within 30 days after notice and demand shall have been mailed to the dealer liable therefor by the taxing jurisdiction. 
(e)  If taxes, penalties and interest assessed shall not be paid within 30 days, there shall be added to the amount assessed, in addition to interest as hereinabove provided, and any other penalties provided by this article, a sum equivalent to five percent of the tax. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-36. - Proceedings to compel action. 
(a)  If any dealer subject to make and file a return required by any provision of this article fails to render such return within the time required, or renders a return which is false or fraudulent in that it contains statements which differ from the true gross sales, purchases, leases or rentals, or other transactions taxable under this article, or otherwise fails to comply with the provisions of this article, for the taxable period for which said return is due, the director shall give such dealer 15 days notice, in writing, requiring such dealer to appear before him with such books, records and papers as he may require, relating to the business of such dealer for such taxable period. The director may require such dealer, or the agents or employees of such dealer, to give testimony or to answer interrogatories, under oath administered by the director respecting the sale at retail, the use, or consumption, or distribution, or storage for use or consumption, in the taxing jurisdiction, or lease or rental of tangible personal property, or other transactions subject to tax, or the failure to make report thereof, as provided in this article. 
(b)  If any dealer fails to make any such return, or refuses to permit an examination of his books, records or papers, or to appear and answer questions within the scope of such investigation relating to the sale, use, consumption, distribution, storage, lease or rental of tangible personal property, or sale of services, the director may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring such dealer to make such return, or requiring the dealer or his agents or employees to appear and answer any such questions or permit such examination, and the court or any judge thereof shall thereupon issue an order, upon such reasonable notice as shall be prescribed therein, to be served upon said dealer or the agents or employees of such dealer, directing him to so appear and testify, and to produce such books, records and papers as may be required. 
(c)  Any person failing to comply with any such order shall be guilty of contempt and shall be punished as provided by law in cases of contempt. 
Sec. 78-37. - Jeopardy assessment. 
(a)  If the director finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from the taxing jurisdiction, or to remove therefrom any property subject to any tax or to any lien for a tax, or to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or render wholly or partly ineffectual any proceedings that might be instituted to collect such tax, whereby it shall have become important that such proceedings be instituted without delay, he may immediately make a determination, from any available information or by estimate or otherwise, of the amount of tax, penalty and interest such taxpayer is liable to pay under this article. Having made such determination, the director shall immediately assess said amount, and by a writing to be retained as part of his official records, indicate such assessment has been made, and without any notice, proceed to distrain as is hereinafter provided any property belonging to the taxpayer. This type of assessment may be made whenever a tax becomes due under the provisions of this article, regardless of whether it is then payable or not. 
(b)  As soon as is feasible after such assessment, and not later than two calendar days thereafter, the director shall send by registered or certified mail a notice to the taxpayer against whom the assessment lies, at the address given in the last report filed by said taxpayer, or if no such report has been filed, to any such address as may be obtainable. Such notice shall inform the taxpayer of the assessment, its basis, and jeopardous nature; make demand for immediate payment thereof; and give notice that any property distrained or to be distrained will be subject to sale as hereinafter provided to satisfy the assessment. 
(c)  The taxpayer against whom the assessment lies can stay distraint of his property, or sale of his property already distrained, as the case may be, only by the immediate payment of the assessment or by posting with the director a surety bond for twice the amount of such assessment, or of a lower amount acceptable to the director, with such sureties as the director deems necessary. The taxpayer shall have 60 calendar days from the date of payment, or the date of posting bond, to appeal to the courts as provided in this article for a re-determination of the assessment. During this period, the director shall hold any payment made in an escrow account. If the taxpayer does not appeal, the director shall immediately credit such payment to tax collections or proceed to collect from sureties, if any were given. In the event of an appeal, such payment or demand for payment from sureties given shall be held in abeyance pending the re-determination or affirmation of the assessment by the court which reviews the matter. Final payment, or collection from sureties, will be for the amount of the affirmed or redetermined assessment. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-38. - Distraint procedure. 
(a)  If any dealer against whom taxes have been assessed under the provisions of this article shall refuse or neglect to pay such taxes within the time prescribed in this article, it shall be lawful for the director to enforce collection of such taxes, together with such interest and other additional amounts as are added by law, by distraint and sale of any property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent dealer. 
(b)  Wherever the words "distraint" or "distrain" are used in this article, they shall be deemed to mean the right to levy upon and seize and sell, or the levying upon, or seizing or selling, of any property or rights to property of the delinquent dealer by the officer charged with the enforcement of collection of the tax for the purposes of satisfying any tax, interest or penalties due under the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Whenever the director shall distrain any property of a taxpayer or dealer, he shall cause to be made a list of the property or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the director shall be sent by certified mail to the taxpayer, dealer or retailer at his last known address or business address or served on him in person. This list shall be accompanied with a note of the sum demanded and a notice of the time and place where the property will be sold, if such a sale is necessary. Thereafter, the director shall cause a notice to be published in the official journal of the taxing jurisdiction wherein distraint is made, specifying the property distrained, and the time and place of sale. The sale shall be held not less than 15 calendar days from the date of the notice mailed or served on the taxpayer or dealer or the date of publication in the official journal, whichever is later. The director may postpone such sale from time to time, if he deems advisable but not for a time to exceed 30 calendar days in all. If the sale is continued it shall be readvertised. 
(d)  Any person in possession of property or rights to property subject to distraint upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand by the director, surrender such property or rights to the director unless such property or right is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process. Any person failing or refusing to surrender any such property or rights shall be liable to the taxing jurisdiction in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest and other costs and charges which are due. 
(e)  The director shall sell at public auction for cash to the highest bidder so much of the property distrained by him as may be sufficient to satisfy the tax, penalties, interest and costs due. He shall give the purchaser a certificate of sale which will be prima facie evidence of the right of the director to make the sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his proceedings in making the sale, and which will transfer to the purchaser all rights, title and interest of the taxpayer or dealer in the property sold. 
(f)  Out of the proceeds of the sale, the director shall first pay all costs of the sale and then apply so much of the balance of the proceeds as may be necessary to pay the assessment. Any balance beyond this shall be paid to the taxpayer, dealer or retailer. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-39. - Summary proceedings. 
    In addition to any other procedure provided in this article or elsewhere in the laws of this city, parish and state and for the purpose of facilitating and expediting the determination and trial of all claims for taxes, penalties, interest, attorney fees or other costs and charges arising under this article, there is hereby provided a summary proceeding for the hearing and determination of all claims by or on behalf of the taxing jurisdiction, or by or on behalf of the director, for taxes, penalties, interest, attorney fees, costs or other charges due thereon, by preference in all courts, all as follows: 
(1)  All such proceedings, whether original or by intervention or third opposition, or otherwise, brought by or on behalf of the taxing jurisdiction, or by or on behalf of the director, for the determination or collection of any tax, interest, penalty, attorney fees, costs or other charge, claimed to be due under any provision of this article, shall be summary and shall always be tried or heard by preference, in all courts, original or appellate, whether in or out of term time, and either in open court or chambers, at such time as may be fixed by the court, which shall be not less than two nor more than ten days after notice to the defendant or opposing party. 
(2)  All defenses whether by exception or to the merits, made or intended to be made to any such claim, must be presented at one time and filed in the court of original jurisdiction prior to the time fixed for the hearing, and no court shall consider any defense unless so presented and filed. This provision shall be construed to deny to any court the right to extend the time for pleading defenses and no continuance shall be granted by any court to any defendant except for legal grounds set forth in C.Cr.P. art. 1602. 
(3)  All matters involving any such claim shall be decided within 48 hours after submission, whether in term time or in vacation, and whether in the court of first instance or in an appellate court and all judgments sustaining any such claim shall be rendered and signed the same day, and shall become final and executory on the fifth calendar day after rendition. No new trial, rehearing or devolutive appeal shall be allowed. Suspensive appeals may be granted, but must be perfected within five calendar days from the rendition of the judgment by giving of bond, with good and solvent security, in a sum double that of the total amount of the judgment, including costs. Such appeals, whether to a court of appeals or to the supreme court, shall be made returnable in not more than 15 calendar days from the rendition of the judgment. 
(4)  Whenever the pleadings filed on behalf of the taxing jurisdiction, or on behalf of the director, shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the director or of the counsel or attorney filing the same, that the facts as alleged are true to the best of the affiant's knowledge or belief, all of the facts alleged in said pleadings shall be accepted as prima facie true and as constituting a prima facie case, and the burden of proof to establish anything to the contrary shall rest wholly on the defendant or opposing party. 
(5)  The city police for the city and the sheriff for the parish shall enforce all injunctions prohibiting the further pursuit of business when a valid injunction and judgment has been obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction involving delinquent sales and use tax under the provision of this article until such time as the delinquent tax, interest, penalties and costs have been paid by the dealer retailer. 
(6)  Failure to pay any tax due, as provided in this article, shall ipso factor, without demand or putting in default, cause said tax, interest, penalties and costs to become immediately delinquent, and the taxing jurisdiction is hereby vested with authority, on motion in a court of competent jurisdiction, to take a rule on the dealer to show cause in not less than two or more than ten days, exclusive of holidays, after the service thereof, which may be tried out of term and in chambers, and shall always be tried by preference, why the dealer should not be ordered to cease from further pursuit of business as a dealer and in case the rule is made absolute, the order thereon rendered shall be considered a judgment in favor of the taxing jurisdiction, prohibiting such dealer from the further pursuit of business until such time as he has paid the delinquent tax, interest, penalties and every violation of the injunction shall be considered as a contempt of court and punished according to law. For the purpose of the enforcement of this article and the collection of the tax levied hereunder, it is presumed that all tangible personal property subject to the provisions of this article will be sold at retail, used or consumed, or stored for use or consumption in the taxing jurisdiction, or leased or rented within the taxing jurisdiction, and is subject to the tax herein levied; however, such presumption shall be prima facie only, and subject to proof furnished to the director. 
Sec. 78-40. - Dealer's right to a hearing. 
    If any dealer shall be aggrieved by any findings or assessment of the director, he may, within 30 days of the receipt of notice of the assessment or finding, file a protest with the director in writing, signed by himself or his duly authorized agent, which shall be under oath and shall set forth the reason therefor, and may request a hearing. Thereafter, the director shall grant a hearing to said dealer, if a hearing has been requested, and may make any order confirming, modifying or vacating any such finding or assessment. The filing of any such protest shall not abate any penalty for nonpayment, nor shall it stay the right of the taxing jurisdiction to collect the tax in any manner herein provided. Appeals from the decision of the director shall be directed to any state, city or federal court of competent jurisdiction, as provided for in section 78-41(b) hereof. 
Sec. 78-41. - Legal remedies for dispute settlement. 
(a)  (1)  A right of action is hereby created to afford a remedy at law for any dealer aggrieved by any provisions of this article. In the case of such dealers resisting the payment of any amount found due, or the enforcement of any provisions of this article in relation thereto, such dealer shall pay under protest the amount found due by the director, and shall give the director notice, at the time, of his intention to file suit for the recovery of the same. Upon receipt of such notice, the amount so paid shall be segregated and held by the director for a period of 30 days. If suit is filed within such time for recovery of the amount paid, such funds so segregated shall be further held pending the outcome of the suit. If the dealer prevails, the director shall refund the amount to the claimant with interest at the rate provided in R.S. 33:2718, covering the period from the date the funds were received by the taxing jurisdiction to the date of refund. 
(2)  The director may transfer to the taxpayer at any time before judgment, taxes, penalty, and interest paid under protest when there is a genuine legal issue and he feels such transfer is in the best interest of the taxing jurisdiction. Interest in connection with such transfers shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  For whatever portion of the judgment awarded to the taxing jurisdiction, the taxpayer shall owe interest at the rate specified in this article from the date the tax was due until the date it was paid under protest. Further, the taxpayer shall owe interest at one-half the rate specified in this article from the date the director transferred the tax, penalty, and interest to the taxpayer until the date of repayment by the taxpayer. 
b.  For that portion of the judgment awarded to the taxpayer, the taxing jurisdiction shall owe interest at the rate specified in this article from the date taxes were paid under protest until the date of transfer to the taxpayer by the director. 
(b)  This section shall afford a legal remedy and right of action in any state, city or federal court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter for a full and complete adjudication of any and all questions arising in the enforcement of this article as to the legality of any tax accrued or accruing or the method of enforcement thereof. In such actions, service shall be upon the mayor. 
(c)  This section shall be construed to provide a legal remedy in the state, city or federal courts, by action of law, in case such taxes or their collection are claimed to be an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce, in violation of any Act of Congress or the United States Constitution, or the Constitution of the State of Louisiana, or in federal jurisprudence; however, upon request of the dealer and upon proper showing by such dealer that the principle of law involved in an additional assessment is already pending before the courts for judicial determination, the dealer, upon agreement to abide by the decision of the courts, may pay the additional assessment under protest, but need not file an additional suit. In such cases, the tax so paid under protest shall be segregated and held by the director until the question of law involved has been determined by the courts and shall then be disposed of as therein provided. 
Sec. 78-42. - Personal liability of dealer. 
    The liability of any person or dealer arising from any tax, interest and penalty from the time they are due shall be a personal debt of such person or dealer to the taxing jurisdiction, recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction in an action at law by the taxing jurisdiction, such debts, whether sued upon or not, shall be a lien on all the property of such delinquent person or dealer, except as against an innocent purchaser for value without notice in the actual course of business, and shall have preference in any distribution of the assets of the person or dealer, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. The proceeds of any judgment or order obtained hereunder shall be paid to the taxing jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-43. - Officer and director liability. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if any corporation fails to file returns or to remit the sales and use taxes collected from purchasers or consumers, the director is authorized, as an alternative means of enforcing collection, to hold those officers or directors having direct control or supervision of such taxes or charged with the responsibility of filing such returns and remitting such taxes and who willfully fail to remit or account for such taxes withheld or collected, personally liable for the total amount of such taxes withheld or collected, and not accounted for or not remitted, together with any interest, penalties, and fees accruing thereon. Collection of the total amount due may be made from any one or any combination of such officers or directors who willfully fail to remit or account for such taxes withheld or collected, by use of any of the alternative remedies for the collection of taxes. 
(b)  A corporation by resolution of the board of directors may designate an officer or director having direct control or supervision of such taxes or charged with the responsibility of filing such returns and remitting such taxes, and such resolution shall be filed with the director. 
(Ord. No. 2001-29, 1-8-2002) 
Sec. 78-44. - Successor liability. 
(a)  If any dealer liable for any tax, interest or penalty hereunder shall sell out his business or stock of goods, or shall quit the business, he shall make a final return and payment within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting business. His successor, successors or assigns, if any, shall withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of such taxes, interest and penalties due and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the director, showing that they have been paid, or a certificate stating that no taxes, interest or penalties are due. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as above provided, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by any former owner, owners or assignors. 
(b)  In the case of a dealer who has quit a business, and who subsequently opens another similar business under the same ownership, whether that ownership is individual, partnership, corporation, or other, that dealer shall be liable for any tax, interest, or penalty owed by the original business. 
Sec. 78-45. - Third party liability. 
    In the event that any dealer is delinquent in the payment of the tax herein provided for, the director may give notice of the amount of such delinquency by registered mail to all persons having in their possession, or under their control, any credits or other personal property belonging to such dealer or owing any debts to such dealer at the time of receipt by them of such notice, and thereafter, any person so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of such credits, either personal property or debts, until the director shall have consented to a transfer or disposition, or until 30 days shall have elapsed from and after the receipt of such notice. All persons so notified must, within five days after receipt of such notice, advise the director of any and all such credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by them. 
Sec. 78-46. - Corporate actions. 
    No corporation organized under the laws of the state shall hereafter be dissolved, or effect a merger, reorganization or consolidation under any law of the state by the action of the stockholders, or by the decree of any court until all taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed on the corporation in accordance with the provisions of this article shall have been paid in full. No foreign corporation which has obtained authority from this state to transact business in the taxing jurisdiction may surrender such authority and withdraw from this state until all taxes, fees, penalties, interest and other charges imposed upon said corporation in accordance with the provisions of this article shall have been fully paid. 
Sec. 78-47. - Rules, regulations and tax forms. 
(a)  The director shall have the power to make and publish reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this article or the laws and the Constitution of this state or of the United States for the enforcement of the provisions of this article and the collection of the revenues and penalties imposed thereby. 
(b)  The director shall design, prepare, print and furnish to all dealers, or make available to all dealers, all necessary forms for filing returns, and instructions to ensure a full collection from dealers and an accounting for the taxes due. Failure of any dealer to secure such forms shall not relieve him from the payment of taxes at the time and in the manner herein provided. 
(c)  The director may design, prepare, print and furnish consolidated or combined forms for the use of those dealers who are required to file returns under this article. 
(d)  The cost of preparing and distributing the report forms and paraphernalia for the collection of the tax, and of the inspection and enforcement duties required herein, shall be borne out of appropriations by the council of the city, unless otherwise specified herein. 
(e)  The director may revise, publish and adopt tax reporting forms, systems, and procedures which require the reporting of summary tax amounts which have been rounded off to the nearest whole dollar. The whole-dollar rounding off shall only be employed in reporting periodic summary tax amounts as directed by the director and shall not be applied to individual transactions or tax applications.

The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the dealer to whom it is addressed.

Sec. 78-53. - Claims for refund. 
(a)  In the event purchases are returned to the dealer by the purchaser or consumer after the tax imposed by this article has been collected or charged to the account of the consumer or user, the dealer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the amount of tax so collected or charged by him in the manner prescribed by the director, and in case the tax has not been remitted by the dealer to the taxing jurisdiction, the dealer may deduct the same in submitting his return, upon receipt of a sworn statement of the dealer as to the gross amount of such refunds during the period covered by such sworn statement, which period shall not be longer than 90 days, the taxing jurisdiction, through the director, shall issue to the dealer an official credit memorandum equal to the net amount remitted by the dealer for such tax collected.

(b)  If the dealer has made an overpayment of his taxes, he may at any time within three years from December 31 of the year in which the tax became due or within one year from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later, on any original or additional tax assessed against him, file with the director a claim under oath for refund, in such form as the director may prescribe, stating the grounds thereof; however, no claim for refund shall be required or permitted to be filed with respect to a tax paid, after protest has been filed with the director, as hereinbefore provided, or after proceedings on appeal have been finally determined. For the purpose of this section, "overpayment" means a payment of tax, penalty or interest when none was due, or the excess of the amount of tax, penalty or interest paid over the amount due. The director is authorized to deduct travel expenses associated with conducting refund audits. 
(c)  If upon examination of such claim for refund, it shall be determined by the director that there has been an overpayment of tax, the amount of such overpayment shall be credited against any liability of any dealer under this article, and if there be no such liability the dealer shall be entitled to a refund of the tax so overpaid. If the director shall reject the claim for refund in whole or in part, he shall make an order accordingly and serve written notice upon such dealer. A dealer may appeal any such rejection as provided in section 78-41 hereof, provided said appeal is taken within 30 days from the date of such notice. 
(d)  Where no question of fact or law is involved, and it appears from the records of the taxing jurisdiction that any monies have been erroneously or illegally collected from any dealer, or have been paid by any dealer under a mistake of fact or law, the director may, at any time within three years from December 31 of the year in which the tax became due or within one year from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later, upon making a record in writing of his reasons therefor, certify that any dealer is entitled to such refund, and thereupon, the director shall authorize the payment thereof from the current year revenues. No claim for refund shall be allowed after a lapse of the three year or one year period. 
(e)  When, to secure compliance with any of the provisions of this article, any monies shall have been deposited with the taxing jurisdiction by any dealer, and shall have been paid over to the taxing jurisdiction, and the director shall be satisfied that such dealer has fully complied with all such provisions, the director shall so certify and authorize repayment from the current year revenues to such dealer of such monies, or such part thereof as the director shall certify has not been applied by him to the satisfaction of any indebtedness arising under this article. 
(f)  (1)  Whenever the unpaid balance of an account due the dealer for the purchase of tangible personal property or the sales of services subject to sales taxation has been found to be paid in accordance with section 166 of the United States Internal Revenue Code and has actually been charged off for federal income tax purposes, the dealer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the amount of tax previously paid by the dealer on such amounts. 
(2)  The refund shall be granted whenever the Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation has found the dealer to be entitled to a tax refund in accordance with R.S. 47:315(B)(4). 
(3)  The prescription on such refund shall begin to run from the date of signature on the federal income tax return charging off such debt. 
(4)  Whenever the balance of an account that had been determined to be worthless and sales tax refunded is recovered at a later date, the payment shall be reported as a new sale in the month recovered for sales tax purposes. 
(5)  The provisions of this section shall apply to debts that are incurred on or after September 3, 1989.

(c)  Backflow prevention assemblies or methods which are in place, but have been out of operation for more than three months, shall be tested before being put back into operation. Backflow prevention assemblies or methods used in seasonal applications shall be tested before being put into operation each season. 
(d)  Any backflow prevention assembly or method which fails a periodic test shall be repaired or replaced by a backflow prevention assembly technician when such assembly is located on private property. When such a device is located on public property, a backflow prevention assembly general tester may repair or replace the device if authorized by the water purveyor. When water service has been terminated for noncompliance, the backflow prevention assembly or method shall be repaired or replaced prior to the resumption of water service. Backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be retested by a registered backflow prevention assembly technician or by a backflow prevention assembly general tester immediately after repair or replacement. 
(e)  The Zachary Department of Inspections may require backflow prevention assemblies or methods to be tested at any time in addition to the annual testing requirement. 
(f)  The registered backflow prevention assembly technician or backflow prevention assembly general tester shall report the testing of backflow prevention assembly or method to the customer and to the administrative authority within 15 days of the test.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Airport means any immovable property subjected to any form of aviation including landing and taking off, regardless of the size or number of aircraft involved and regardless of the ownership interest in said property. 
    Airport noise contours drawn around the active or planned future runways of an airport, based on either the LDN, NEF, CNR or, CNEL, noise estimating methodologies, which contours establish the noise impact zones of an airport. Where the contours relate to planned future runways, these contours shall be based on the anticipated number and type of aircraft operations forecast for the planned future runway. 
    Board of adjustment means a board consisting of five members appointed by the legislative body of political subdivision having jurisdiction over the airport, for the purpose of hearing appeals, as provided for in R.S. 33:4727. 
    Community noise equivalent level (CNEL) a scale that takes into account all the A-weighted acoustic energy received at a point from all noise events causing noise levels above some prescribed value. Weighting factors are then included which place greater importance upon noise events occurring during the evening hours: (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) five decibels added to these sound levels and even greater importance upon noise events occurring at night: (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) ten decibels added to these sound levels.

Any given NEF is equivalent to Ldn minus 35, plus or minus 3. Between NEF and CNR there is a nonlinear relationship, and any given NEF is a nonlinear relationship, and any given NEF is equivalent to CNEL minus 33, plus or minus 2. 
    Composite noise rating (CNR) a scale that takes into account the totality of aircraft operations at an airport in quantifying the total aircraft noise environment. A CNR value begins with a measure of the maximum noise magnitude from each aircraft flyover and adds weighting factors that sum the total effect of all flights. The scale used to describe individual noise events is perceived noise level (PNL), which is expressed in PNdB (a quantity measured in decibels that provides a subjective assessment of the perceived "noisiness" of aircraft noise). 
    Day-night average sound level (Ldn) a 24-hour average, sound level expressed in A-weighted decibels, with a ten-decibel penalty applied to noise events from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The penalty for nighttime noise events accounts for the increased sensitivity of most people to noise in the quiet nighttime hours. 
    dBA a unit of corrected noise level providing a measurement of noise in accordance with levels actually heard by the ear, based on an "A-weighting scale". 
    Decibel a unit for measuring the relative loudness of sound or sound pressure equal approximately to the smallest degree of difference of loudness or sound pressure ordinarily detectable by the ear, the range of which includes about 130 decibels on a scale beginning with one for the faintest audible sound. Abbreviated dB. 
    Noise exposure forecast (NEF) a scale presently used by the Federal Aviation Administration for land use planning in connection with airports. In the NEF scale, the basic measure of magnitude for individual noise events is the effective perceived noise level (EPNL), which is expressed in units of EPNdB. It is derived from the perceived noise level (used for calculation of the CNR) by applying corrections for pure tones and the duration of the event. 
    Noise impact zones means those zones in the vicinity of the airport, as shown on a noise contour map, which are impacted by noise from aircraft operations of the airport. 
    Noise-unwanted sound means the intensity, frequency, duration and character of sound (from a source or a number of sources). Noise includes sound and vibration of subaudible frequencies. 
    Person means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or governmental entity; includes a trustee, a receiver, an assignee, or a similar representative of any of them. 
    Runway means any area on land or water prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft, regardless of size. 
    Safety zones means zones established under the airport hazard zoning ordinance, where noise impact zones and safety zones overlap, the most restrictive provisions of either ordinance will apply. 
    Sound transmission class (STC) a classification number from the rating of single number for classification by comparison with a standard curve of transmission loss measured in one-third octave bands. 
    Water surfaces for the purpose of this article shall have the same meaning as land for the establishment of protected zones.

ARTICLE 1 ZONING DISTRICTS; USES
AND ACCESSORY USES
Division 1.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 1.101 Purpose of Article
The purpose of this Article is to establish zoning districts and set out, generally, what is allowed and not
allowed in each district. This Article also provides supplemental standards that control the development of
buildings and structures on residential and nonresidential lots.
Sec. 1.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. In general, this Article:
1. Divides the City into zoning districts;
2. Sets out which land uses are allowed, and which are not allowed, in each zoning district; and
3. Provides standards for "limited" and "conditional" uses, which are subject to additional standards,
and in the case of conditional uses, public hearing procedures.
B. Zoning Districts. Division 1.200, Zoning Districts Established, establishes the districts that provide for
the character and type of development that is allowed in various parts of the City. The zoning districts
are shown on the Official Zoning Map, which is established in Section 1.202, Official Zoning Map.
C. Permitted, Limited, Conditional, and Prohibited Uses. Division 1.300, Permitted, Limited, Conditional,
and Prohibited Uses, establishes which uses are allowed and not allowed in each zoning district. In
general, uses are permitted or prohibited in each zoning district. However, for some uses, there are
other classifications:
1. Limited Uses, which are approved by the responsible official according to the procedures set out in
Article 14, Permits and Procedures, subject to special standards that ensure that the uses are
compatible with their neighbors. These standards are set out in Division 1.400, Limited and Special
Use Standards; and
2. Conditional Uses, which are approved by the City Council, which applies general standards and
special standards to ensure that the uses are compatible with their neighbors and the community
as a whole.
D. Uses That Are Not Specifically Listed. Any use that is not listed in Section 1.302, Residential, Home, and
Institutional Uses; Section 1.303, Commercial, Recreation, and Amusement Uses; Section 1.304,
Industrial, Agricultural, and Special Uses; and Section 1.305, Temporary Uses; is prohibited. However, it
is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit closely related uses or new uses that have impacts that
are similar to those of uses that are allowed. As such, Section 1.307, Unlisted or Functionally Similar
Uses, provides the rules for interpretation of unlisted or functionally similar uses, to determine
whether they are allowed or not.
E. Temporary Uses. Division 1.500, Temporary Uses, provides standards for the approval of temporary
uses, including but not limited to garage sales, temporary buildings, and special events.

Division 1.200 Zoning Districts Established
Sec. 1.201 Zoning Districts
A. Generally. Ten zoning districts are established in four general use categories. The zoning districts are
set out in Table 1.201A, Zoning Districts. The general use categories are agriculture, residential,
commercial and mixed use, and industry and business. The comprehensive plan designation for each
district is provided for reference.

Designation
District Purpose and Description
Agriculture
Agriculture and
Forestry
Rural
Generally. This district is a use-based district intended to permit agriculture
and forestry to be the primary use of land, and restrict uses or activities that
interfere with agriculture or where owners would be impacted by the noise,
dirt, or odors associated with agricultural uses.
Character. This district is rural in character. The agriculture and forestry uses
around the City have trivial amounts of impervious surfaces and, thus, are
considered an open space use.
Uses. Agriculture and forestry are the primary use of the land. Residential
uses may be accessory to the primary use. Other uses are limited to those
that are supportive of or similar to the primary agricultural or forestry use.
Infrastructure. Water and sewer may be provided on-site or by public
systems.
Residential
Estate
Estate
Generally. This district is a very low density residential district. It is intended
to provide for the use of areas that are not presently accessible to the City's
urban services. It is intended that this land remain undeveloped until
services can be extended, but the district provides a development option.
Character. This district is semi-rural in nature, which is characterized by a
balance between the landscape and buildings that favors the landscape. Onsite
landscaping and tree-lined streets shelter the buildings. Open space and
low proportions of impervious surfaces characterize the built environment.
Development clustering may be used to ensure an adequate amount of open
space will be available upon build-out to enhance neighborhood character
and the lifestyle of residents.
Uses. This district is intended to allow residential neighborhoods.
Recreational uses that serve the neighborhoods are permitted, but are
restricted in scale to preserve the safety and integrity of the neighborhood
streets.
Infrastructure. Public water is required; sewer treatment may be provided
on-site

District Purpose and Description
Suburban
Suburban
Generally. This district is the primary residential district for the City. It is
intended to permit a wide range of residential uses on larger lots, and to
encourage a variety of housing types.
Character. This district is suburban in nature, which is characterized by a
balance between the landscape and buildings, with on-site landscaping and
tree-lined streets that shelter the buildings. Open space and low proportions
of impervious surfaces characterize the built environment. Development
clustering will ensure an adequate amount of open space will be available
upon build-out to enhance suburban character and the lifestyle of residents.
Uses. This district is intended to allow residential neighborhoods, while
permitting a range of housing types to meet all residential needs.
Institutional and recreational uses that serve the neighborhoods are
permitted, but are restricted in scale to preserve the safety and integrity of
the neighborhood streets.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.
Urban
Urban
Generally. This district is the highest intensity residential district. It is
intended to permit a wide range of residential uses and encourage a variety
of housing types. It is located near the traditional downtown and near major
shopping areas and employment centers.
Character. This district has an urban character, which is characterized by
residential buildings that cover a large percentage of the lot and are spaced
closely enough to create a perception of street enclosure.
Uses. This district is intended to create higher density residential
neighborhoods to meet the community's housing needs for higher density
and infill housing development. Institutional and recreational uses that serve
this urban neighborhood environment are permitted and encouraged.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.
Neighborhood
Conservation See
Subsection B.,
Neighborhood
Conservation
Subdistricts
See Table 1.201B,
Neighborhood
Conservation
Subdistricts, below.
Generally. This district is intended to preserve the character of the
designated existing residential neighborhoods that were developed under
prior zoning categories that are no longer used in this UDC, or of platted
areas that may now be nonconforming. This district is intended to ensure
that owners of property in designated established neighborhoods are not
required to seek variances to improve existing homes that were either built
before zoning regulations were adopted, or conformed to the regulations
that were in effect when they were constructed. By retaining existing lot size
and dimensional character of the areas as platted and built upon,
nonconformities are avoided. Application of this district does not remove
the unlawful status of uses, buildings, or improvements that were
constructed without required permits or in violation of applicable
regulations that were in effect at the time of construction.
Applicability. This district shall only be applied to areas that have been
subdivided before the effective date of this UDC, and that are generally
surrounded with developed lots that are likely to be divided into no more
than ten lots.
Character. The NC district varies in character, from urban residential to
estate residential. See Table 1.201B, Neighborhood Conservation
Subdistricts, below.
Uses. The district is intended to preserve existing residential character and
discourage conversion of residential uses to other uses.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.

District Purpose and Description
Neighborhood
Commercial
CN
Generally. This district is intended to provide for small-scale commercial uses that provide services to
nearby neighborhoods, and for the adaptive re- use of residential buildings for commercial and office
uses along specific corridors or at specific intersections where changes in traffic patterns have made the
buildings less desirable for residential use.
Character. The character of this district is generally residential. Standards are designed so that
commercial uses are compatible with residential neighborhoods. Buildings have a residential character
and scale, and sites are heavily landscaped to minimize the impacts of nonresidential uses and
associated parking areas so that they appear residential in character. The scale of buildings is restricted
to permit only neighborhood- serving uses.
Uses. The district allows for a range of retail and office uses, with the impacts of the uses limited
through buffering and the small scale of the buildings. It also allows for live-work units.
Corridor
Commercial
CC
Generally. This district is intended to provide for commercial uses and activities that provide services to
residents of the City of Zachary. This district can accommodate a large range of commercial, office, and
service uses.
Character. The character of this district is commercial uses located on corridors that provide access to
the residential neighborhoods of Zachary. Standards are designed to provide for a range of uses
including service/retail, commercial clusters and mixed-use corridors. The character of this district
balances the pedestrian-oriented environment with reasonable parking requirements.
Uses. This district is intended to provide a range of commercial uses that serve the residents of Zachary,
including but not limited to retail, office, restaurant and service.
General Commercial
Generally. This district is the primary commercial district. It accommodates highway service uses and
community or regional commercial, office, and service uses.
Character. This district has an auto-urban character. Landscape buffers and landscaping within parking
areas are required to soften the impact of large areas of pavement and beautify the district. Building
form regulations apply that encourage and require creativity in building design. These regulations are
intended to prevent visual degradation that results from "logo building" architecture, and from very
large buildings with large blank walls, little or no building articulation, and little or no attention to
architectural detail or design elements.
Uses. This district is intended to provide for a full range of community and regional scale commercial
enterprises, including but not limited to retail, office, restaurant, entertainment, and service.

Designation
District Purpose and Description
Urban Center
Urban
Generally. This district is for the downtown area, nearby redevelopment
areas, and, in some cases, vertically mixed-use areas in Traditional
Neighborhood Developments. It is intended to permit a range of ground
floor retail and service uses, as well as residential-over-retail and office-overretail
uses.
Character. This district has an urban character, which is characterized by
multi-story connected buildings that define the street and create a sense of
enclosure. Buildings are the dominant visual element. Landscaping is formal,
with regular street trees, planters, and street furniture. Parking areas are
generally located behind buildings, or otherwise screened from view from
Main Street and Church Street. A minimum height of two stories and zero
(or minimal) front and side setbacks are necessary to create the urban
character.
Uses. This district is intended to encourage mixed-use infill development and
adaptive re-use. Retail, restaurants, and service businesses are desired on
the street level. Upper levels should provide office and residential uses. A
mix of uses that provides for the optimal 24-hour use of the land.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.
Industry and Business
Business Park
Auto-urban
Generally. This district provides for a full range of office, research, light
industrial, wholesale, distribution, and storage uses in a campus-like setting
that attracts high-quality businesses. It is intended to provide few potential
nuisances to neighboring residential areas.
Character. The character of this district is auto-urban buildings, buffered
from views outside of the district by landscape buffers and buildings with
attractive architecture. Landscaped surfaces are required to provide an
amenity for the businesses and to accommodate on-site or shared
stormwater detention and treatment areas.
Uses. This district is intended to provide for wide range of business uses.
This includes offices, research, light industrial, wholesale, distribution and
storage. Also permitted are commercial uses that support these businesses,
such as restaurants and office supply businesses. Also permitted are uses
that can share available parking in the evening. Outside storage is limited,
and must be effectively screened.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.
Industry
Auto-urban
Generally. This district provides for a range of heavier industrial uses that
may be unsightly, or have higher potential for nuisance to adjoining
residential neighborhoods than uses in Business Park (BP) districts. It is
intended to protect land that has access to water or rail transportation that
are critical to many of these uses.
Character. The character of this district is a utilitarian auto-urban. Buildings
and structures, outside storage, and uses that are basically machines
(concrete mixing for example) are often unsightly. This district must be
buffered from views outside of the district by extensive landscape buffers.
Open spaces are required for on-site or shared stormwater detention and
treatment areas.
Uses. This district is intended to provide for industrial uses that are unsightly
or have high nuisance potential. Very large buildings both in height and area
are permitted in this district. These uses are generally poor neighbors to
residential areas.
Infrastructure. Public water and sewer are required.

B. Neighborhood Conservation Subdistricts. The Neighborhood Conservation (NC) district is divided into
nine subdistricts, as set out in Table 1.201B, Neighborhood Conservation Subdistricts. All lots that
existed as of the effective date of this UDC are conforming if they are located in any NC subdistrict,
regardless of their area or lot width. The minimum lot size and minimum lot width that form the basis
for the subdistricts are used to control further subdivision. Development standards for each subdistrict
are set out in Section 2.301, Single-Family Detached and Single-Family Detached Cluster Lot Standards.

one or more zoning districts that allows for the density and intensity of development set out in the
approved TND Master Plan. The zoning that is assigned may be conditioned so that it allows not
more than five percent more units than are approved in the TND Master Plan.
C. Undesignated Land. It is the intent of the City Council that all land within the City be zoned. Therefore
any land that is not assigned a zoning district on the Zoning Map is zoned AF.
Division 1.300 Permitted; Limited; Conditional; and Prohibited Uses
Sec. 1.301 Interpretation of Use Tables
A. Generally. The tables in Section 1.302, Residential, Home, and Institutional Uses, through Section
1.305, Temporary Uses, list uses in rows and zoning districts in columns. Where rows and columns
intersect, a letter indicates if the use is permitted, limited, conditional, or prohibited in the district.
B. Symbols. All the tables use the following symbols:
1. "P" means that the use is Permitted. Permitted uses are approved by the issuance of use permits
pursuant to Article 14, Permits and Procedures.
2. "L" means that the use is a Limited Use. Limited uses are permitted by right, subject to the
standards of Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use Standards, for that specific use.
a. The notation "L(T)" means that it is a limited use that is restricted to Traditional Neighborhood
Developments. The use must also meet the standards in Division 1.400, Limited and
Conditional Use Standards. L(T) uses are approved by City Staff, but Traditional Neighborhood
Development master plans must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
b. The notation "L(#)" or "L(M)" with is found only in the NC column, and limits the use to the
designated NC subdistrict. A number relates to the numerical designation of the NC subdistrict
in which the use is allowed. "M" relates to the NCMH subdistrict. See Table 1.201B,
Neighborhood Conservation Subdistricts.
c. The notation "L(E)" means that the use is limited by the following standards:
i. It is limited to existing lots and buildings that contain the use as of the effective date of
this UDC; and
ii. The use or buildings may be improved, expanded, or reconstructed, but, in the case of
residential uses, additional units may not be added.
3. "C" means that the use is a Conditional Use, subject to the standards in Division 1.400, Limited and
Conditional Use Standards, and Section 14.501, Conditional Use Requirements, which apply to all
Conditional Uses.
4. "-" means that the use is Prohibited in that district.

Sec. 1.306 Prohibited Uses in All Districts
The following uses are prohibited in all zoning districts:
1. Intensive agriculture.
2. Disposal facilities involving radioactive materials.
3. Uses that are prohibited by state law, or that necessarily involve operations or products that are
prohibited by state law.
4. Uses that are prohibited by federal law, or that necessarily involve operations or products that are
prohibited by federal law.
Sec. 1.307 Unlisted and Functionally Similar Uses
A. Generally. If a proposed use is not listed in Section 1.302, Residential, Home, and Institutional Uses;
Section 1.303, Commercial, Recreation, and Amusement Uses; Section 1.304, Industrial, Agricultural,
and Special Uses; or Section 1.305, Temporary Uses; or if the definition of a use is not obvious as
applied to a proposed use, then the responsible official shall decide whether the proposed use is
either a subcategory of a permitted, limited, or conditional use, or a use that is functionally
comparable to a permitted, limited, or conditional use. In making this determination, the responsible
official shall apply the following criteria:
ARTICLE 1 ZONING DISTRICTS PAGE 13
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
1. A proposed use is a subcategory of a permitted, limited, or conditional use if:
a. Its North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is a subset of an NAICS code
for a permitted, limited, or conditional use; and
b. With regard to each of the decision criteria enumerated in subsection B., the proposed use's
impacts are not materially greater than the permitted, limited, or conditional use with the
more general NAICS code.
2. A proposed use is functionally comparable to a permitted, limited, or conditional use if, with
regard to each of the decision criteria enumerated in subsection B., the proposed use has no
greater impacts than the permitted, limited, or conditional use with which it is functionally similar.
B. Decision Criteria. The following decision criteria shall be evaluated when the responsible official
decides whether a proposed use is a subcategory of, or is functionally comparable to, a permitted,
limited, or conditional use:
1. Parking demand;
2. Average daily and peak hour trip generation (cars and tucks);
3. Water demand;
4. Solid waste generation;
5. Impervious surface;
6. Noise;
7. Lighting;
8. Dust;
9. Odors;
10. Potentially hazardous conditions, such as projectiles leaving the site;
11. Use and storage of hazardous materials;
12. Character of buildings and structures;
13. Character of operation; and
14. Hours of operation.
C. Effect of Responsible Official's Determination.
1. If the responsible official approves an application for a decision pursuant to this Section, then the
use is allowed as a permitted, limited, or conditional use, with the same restrictions as the use to
which it was compared for the purposes of the favorable decision.
2. If the responsible official determines that a proposed use is not a subcategory of, or functionally
comparable to, a permitted, limited, or conditional use, then the proposed use is a prohibited use.

Division 1.400 Use Standards
Sec. 1.401 Residential Limited and Conditional Use Standards
A. Generally. The standards of Table 1.401, Residential Limited and Conditional Use Standards, apply to
residential uses that are specified in Table 1.302, Residential, Home, and Institutional Uses, as "L,"
"L(T)," or "C."
B. How to Use Table 1.401, Residential Limited and Conditional Use Standards.
1. The columns in Table 1.401, Residential Limited and Conditional Use Standards establish the
standards that apply to each of the limited and conditional residential uses. They are interpreted
as follows:
a. Use. The first column, use, lists the residential use to which the standards specified in the
same row apply.
b. District. The second column, district, lists the district in which the standards specified in the
same row apply. For example, in the first row, the use is "multifamily" and the district is "RS,"
while in the second row, the use is the same, but the districts are "CS" and "CG." This means
that different standards apply to the use, depending upon the district in which it is located.
c. Location. The third column, location, specifies where the use may be located; for example, in
an existing building that is put to the use or on the upper floors of a mixed-use building. This
column may also restrict the location of a particular component of the use, for example, the
residential uses of a Traditional Neighborhood Development.
d. Required Access Type. The fourth column, required access type, specifies the classification of
street from which access to the use must be provided.
e. Spacing from Same Use. The fifth column, spacing from same use, specifies the shortest
distance from parcel line to parcel line that is required between the limited or conditional use
and other parcels put to the same use (regardless of the district in which the other instance of
the same use is located).
2. A dash "-" in a table cell means that the requirement of the column does not apply to the use
indicated in the row.

Sec. 1.402 Home Limited and Commercial Uses
A. Generally. The standards of Table 1.402, Residential Limited and Special Use Standards, apply to
residential uses that are specified in Table 1.302, Residential, Home, and Institutional Uses, as "L" or
"C.".
B. How to Use Table 1.402, Home Use Standards. The columns in Table 1.402, Home Use Standards
establish the standards that apply to each of the limited and conditional home uses. Classifications of
home uses are listed in columns, and standards are set out in rows. The rows are interpreted as
follows:
1. Minimum Lot Area. The first row, minimum lot size, establishes the minimum lot size for the use.
2. Maximum Floor Area. The second row, maximum floor area, limits the amount of the principal
building that can be used for home uses.
3. Signage. The third row, signage, establishes limitations on the signage related to the home use.
4. Separate Access or Entrance. The fourth row, separate access or entrance, sets the standards for
the type of access to the business. It is either a single access through the front door to the dwelling
unit, or a separate access to the home use. Unless the use is in an accessory building or structure,
there shall be internal connectivity between the home and business.
5. Outdoor Storage. The fifth row, outdoor storage, regulates whether any materials used in the
business may be stored outdoors.
6. Commercial Vehicles. The sixth row, commercial vehicles, controls the parking of commercial
vehicles and vehicles that advertise the business.
7. Street Frontage. The seventh row, street frontage, limits the type of street from which the use
must take vehicular access.
8. Parking. The eighth row, parking, sets the standards for parking of home uses. These standards are
in addition to the parking requirements for the dwelling unit itself.
9. Retail Sales. The ninth row, retail sales, governs the sales or products from the use.
10. Prohibited Nonresidential Uses. The tenth row, prohibited nonresidential uses, lists the
nonresidential uses that are not allowed in conjunction with the specified home use.

Sec. 1.403 Institutional Limited and Conditional Uses
A. Generally. The standards of Table 1.403, Institutional Limited and Special Use Standards, apply to
institutional uses that are specified in Table 1.302, Residential, Home, and Institutional Uses, as "L" or
"C."
B. How to Use Table 1.403, Institutional Limited and Conditional Use Standards.
1. The columns in Table 1.403, Institutional Limited and Conditional Use Standards establish the
standards that apply to each of the limited and conditional institutional uses. They are interpreted
as follows:
a. Use. The first column, use, lists the residential use to which the standards specified in the
same row apply.
b. District. The second column, district, lists the district in which the standards specified in the
same row apply. For example, in the second row, the use is "College / University / Vo- Tech"
and the district is "AF," while in the third row the use is the same, but the district is "I." This
means that different standards apply to the use, depending upon the district in which it is
located.
c. Street Frontage. The third column, street frontage, specifies the classification of street that
must provide access to the use.
d. Use and Scale Limitations. The fourth column, use and scale limitations, specifies any
limitations on the operation or scale of the use. Floor area limitations may also be applicable.
See Article 2, District Intensity and Bulk Standards.
e. Spacing from Same Use. The fifth column, spacing from same use, specifies the shortest
distance from parcel line to parcel line that is required between the limited or conditional use
and other parcels put to the same use.
f. Spacing from Other Use. The sixth column, spacing from other use, specifies the shortest
distance from parcel line to parcel line that is required between the limited or special use and
specified other uses.
g. Buffering. The seventh column, buffering, specifies additional buffering that must be provided
around the use.
2. A dash "-" in a table cell means that the requirement of the column does not apply to the use
indicated in the row.

ARTICLE 1 ZONING DISTRICTS PAGE 36
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
prominent facade of a structure and should be located out of the pedestrian line-of- sight, unless
stealthing techniques reasonably eliminate visual impacts.
d. Whenever possible, equipment structures, back-up generators, and other equipment associated with
building-mounted antennas should be installed within the existing building compound. If this is not
feasible, the equipment shall be screened, fenced, or landscaped to minimize its appearance from
off-site locations and to visually blend with the surrounding natural and built environment. Equipment
buildings should be designed in an architectural style and constructed of exterior building materials
that are consistent with surrounding development and/or land use setting (if applicable).
e. Roof-mounted antennas and associated equipment shall be located as far back from the edge of the
roof as technically possible to minimize visibility from street level locations. Where appropriate,
construction of a rooftop parapet wall or other appropriate screening may be required to hide the
facility.
2. Signage. No advertising signage or identifying logos shall be displayed on any wireless
telecommunications facility, except for small identification plates used for emergency notification or
hazardous or toxic materials warning.
3. Stealth Design. The applicants are encouraged to consider providing architectural treatments and to
use stealth techniques to reduce potential visual impacts for all wireless telecommunications
facilities, and especially for those proposed in areas easily visible from a major traffic corridor,
commercial center or residential area. Stealth techniques can be required as conditions of approval
when determined to be necessary to mitigate adverse visual impacts.
4. Colors and Materials. The colors and materials of wireless telecommunications facilities shall be
chosen to minimize the visual impact of the facilities.
5. Screening. The lowest ten feet of any accessory building and tower shall be visually screened on a
year-round basis with suitable vegetation or nearby buildings. The scale and nature of vegetation shall
be of sufficient density to conform with the above requirements within three years, as determined by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
6. Lighting. The use of lighting shall not be allowed on wireless telecommunications facilities except as a
required public safety measure by the Federal Aviation Agency. However, when incorporated into the
approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate athletic fields, parking lots, or similar
areas may be attached to the tower.

ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 42
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Division 2.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 2.101 Purpose of Article
A. Generally. The purpose of this Article is to establish the general standards for the intensity and
character of development that is allowed within each zoning district.
B. Standards Applicable to Parcels Proposed for Development. This Article establishes general
regulations for the character of entire parcels proposed for development through the use of
limitations on density (and, in some cases, intensity); minimum requirements for open space or
landscaped surface area; a minimum area requirement for the parcel proposed for development
(which is based on the proposed use and zoning district); minimum requirements for the
provision of utilities; in the case of traditional neighborhood developments and mixed housing
neighborhoods, the minimum required mix of housing types; and the averaging of lot sizes.
C. Standards Applicable to Individual Lots. The character of development of individual lots is
regulated by minimum requirements for building height, lot dimensions, setbacks, building
coverage, floor area ratios (in limited cases), and open space or landscaped surface ratios (if the
individual lot is the entire parcel proposed for development). This Article also provides standards
for the design and location of accessory uses and structures, and for common incidental uses of
residential and nonresidential lots (e.g., parking of commercial vehicles).
Sec. 2.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. The Divisions of this Article apply as set out in this Section.
B. Standards for Parcels Proposed for Development. Division 2.200, Standards for Parcels
Proposed for Development applies to parcels of land that either have not been subdivided, or are
proposed for re-subdivision (replatting) or modifications to an existing subdivision.
C. Residential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards. After the standards of Division 2.200, Standards for
Parcels Proposed for Development, are applied (or if a subdivision in a zoning district other than
NC had been approved before the effective date of this UDC), then the standards of Division
2.300, Residential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards, are applied to the development of individual
lots in the subdivision. If the mixed housing requirements of Section 2.202, Mix of Housing Types
in TNDs and Mixed Housing Neighborhoods, apply, then the selection of lot sizes shall implement
those requirements.
D. Special Standards for Neighborhood Conservation Districts.
1. All buildings that lawfully existed or were the subject of an active building permit on the
effective date of this UDC are "conforming" buildings with respect to the height and setback
requirements of this UDC if they are located in an NC district. However, this Section does
not make the following buildings conforming:
a. Buildings that were constructed without required permits; and
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 43
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
b. Buildings that were constructed in violation of permit requirements.
2. All lots that lawfully existed on the effective date of this UDC are "conforming" with respect
to lot width and lot area if they are located in the NC district. The lot width and lot area
requirements of Division 2.400, Special Standards for Neighborhood Conservation Districts,
apply only to the subdivision or combination of existing lots or parcels within the NC district
after the effective date. See Example 2.102, Application of Lot Width and Area Requirements
in the NC15 District.
Example 2.102
Application of Lot Width and Area Requirements in NC15 District
This example uses the requirements of the NC15 District (15,000 square foot minimum lot area and 100 foot minimum lot
width) for illustrative purposes only. All of the other NC subdistricts are applied in the same way.
Lawfully Existing Lot #1: NC15 District,
10,000 square feet in area, 90 feet wide
Lawfully Existing Lot #2: NC15 District,
35,000 square feet in area, 190 feet wide
Lawfully Existing Lot #3: NC15 District,
35,000 square feet in area, 250 feet wide
This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully
existing on the effective date of this UDC.
Since it is smaller than the minimum lot size
(and narrower than the minimum lot width),
it cannot be subdivided further.
This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully
existing on the effective date of this UDC.
Even though it is more than twice as large as
the minimum lot area for the NC15 District, it
cannot be subdivided unless the new lots are
configured to meet the minimum lot width
requirement.
This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully
existing on the effective date of this UDC.
This lot could be subdivided into two lots,
provided that each lot meet the minimum lot
area and minimum lot width requirements of
the NC15 District.
3. Neighborhood Conservation districts are not subject to the standards of Division 2.200 and
Division 2.300, but are subject to the general residential standards of Division 2.500, General
Residential Standards, except where specifically exempted within that Division.
F. Nonresidential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards. After the standards of Division 2.200, Standards
for Parcels Proposed for Development, are applied (or if a nonresidential subdivision had been
approved before the effective date of this UDC), then the standards of Division 2.600,
Nonresidential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards, are applied to the development of buildings on
the parcel or its individual lots.
G. Accessory Uses and Supplemental Standards. In addition to the standards that may apply to a
particular use or building, there are standards that apply to all residential and nonresidential
uses. These standards cover accessory uses and accessory buildings; fences; vehicle storage;
pools; tennis courts; the keeping of animals; and the like. See Division 2.500, General Residential
Standards and Division 2.700, General Nonresidential Standards.
Division 2.200 Standards for Parcels Proposed for Development
Sec. 2.201 Residential Density, Open Space, and Parcel Standards
A. Generally. The open space, density, utility, and minimum parcel area standards that are
applicable residential development are provided in Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards.
B. How to Use Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards. The columns in Table 2.201, Residential
Parcel Standards establish the open space, density, utility, and minimum parcel areas that apply
to each of the residential development types. They are interpreted as follows:
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 44
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
1. The first column, district and development type (average lot size), reflects the zoning
districts (shaded in orange) and the residential development types that are permitted in the
district. The average lot size listed in parentheses is for informational purposes only (it is the
basis for the calculations in the table), and is not a regulatory requirement.
2. The second column, min. OSR, reflects the minimum open space ratio. Open space is
required only for development that contains five or more dwelling units. OSR is calculated as
set out in Section 17.203, Open Space Ratio. The third column, gross density, contains the
maximum gross density for the use.
3. The third column, gross density, contains the maximum gross density. This is generally
expressed in dwelling units per acre. Where "rms" (rooms) is used, the word refers to
individual sleeping rooms, and rooms such as kitchens, storage, laundry, and common areas
are not included. Gross density is calculated as set out in Section 17.205, Density.
4. The fourth column, net density, contains the maximum net density, which is used in the site
capacity calculations in Article 3, Open Space and Environmental Quality. Where "rooms" is
used, the word refers to individual sleeping rooms, and rooms such as kitchens, storage,
laundry, and common areas are not included. Net density is calculated as set out in Section
17.205, Density.
5. The fifth column, required utilities, indicates if public water and sewer utilities are required.
The requirement for public utilities, either from the City or from an approved utility
provider, is indicated by "Public," whereas "On-Site" indicates that on-site potable water
and individual sewer systems are permitted (public systems may also be used, and must be
used instead of on-site systems if lines are available within 300 feet of the development).
6. The sixth column, min. area of parcel proposed for development, indicates the minimum
area of the parcel proposed for development that is required for the development of the
specified use.

Sec. 2.202 Mix of Housing Types in TNDs and Mixed Housing Neighborhoods
A. Generally.
1. The following types of development shall include a mix of housing types pursuant to this
Section.
a. Mixed-housing neighborhoods; and
b. TNDs.
2. Individual housing types that may be included in the mix are set out in Section 2.301, Single-
Family Detached and Single-Family Detached Cluster, through Section 2.308, Cottage Homes.
B. Housing Type Mix Requirements. Table 2.202, Housing Type Mix Requirements, sets out the mix
of housing types that are required for mixed housing neighborhoods and TNDs. When calculating
the percentage of each housing type in a proposed development, normal rounding is allowed.

TABLE NOTE:
1 This requirement applies even if more than the minimum number of housing types are provided.
C. Phasing. When a development is to be phased, the maximum residential development capacity
of the entire site shall be used for calculating the required mix. When a parcel is to be subdivided
and developed as multiple mixed housing neighborhoods or TNDs over time, the City may
impose a mix based on the original property size to ensure an adequate mix of housing types.
Sec. 2.203 Residential Lot Averaging and Distribution of Averaged Lots
A. Generally. Lot averaging is a design technique which replaces a minimum lot with an average lot
width and a requirement that certain percentages of lots fall into one of three lot area groups:
small lots, average lots, and large lots. See Figure 2.203, Lot Averaging. Lot averaging shall be
applied as required in subsection B., and is optional in other cases.
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 47
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
Figure 2.203
Lot Averaging
B. Applicability.
1. Lot averaging shall be applied:
a. To a housing type when there are more than 40 units of the housing type in a mixed
housing development or TND (e.g., if there are 50 single family detached homes, 45
patio homes, and 30 standard townhomes in a development, lot averaging must be
applied to the single family detached and patio homes, but is not required for the
townhomes).
b. To any of the following types of development that contains more than 40 dwelling
units: single family detached, single family detached cluster, conservation cluster, and
preservation cluster developments.
2. Lot area groups for each housing type are provided in the tables of Division 2.300,
Residential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards.
3. Where lot averaging is not required, but the tables of Division 2.300, Residential Lot, Yard,
and Height Standards, indicate three lot area groups, the average lot area group shall be
used to establish minimum lot area and minimum lot depth for the housing type.
C. Identifying Lots in Each Group. Lots within each size group are identified by lot width. Small lots
shall meet the minimum lot width for small lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not
including) the lot width of the average lot category. Average lots shall meet the minimum lot
width for average lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not including) the lot width of the
large lot category. Large lots must meet the minimum lot width for large lots, and their width is
not limited.
D. Calculating the Required Number of Lots of Each Lot Area Group. In the tables of Division 2.300,
Residential Lot, Yard, and Height Standards, that provide for variable lot sizes, the column titled
"percent in width type," indicates the minimum proportion of each lot area group that must be
provided. The minimum number of small and average lots shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole number. The large lot category is always listed as "remainder" because after the minimum
proportions for small and average lots are met, the remainder of the lots may be large lots.
E. Distribution of Averaged Lots. Lots in the three lot area groups shall be distributed as follows:
1. Lots in each of the three lot area groups (small lots, average lots, and large lots) shall be
mixed on each block or cul-de-sac so that they are spread evenly through the development
(except as provided in D.2., below). Concentrating lots of a single lot area group in separate
areas of a development is not allowed.
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 48
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
2. TND and mixed housing neighborhood plans may designate a mix of housing types or
diverse single-family house sizes on a single block or block face. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may approve such developments even if they do not strictly comply with
subsection D.1., above, if it finds that the overall distribution of housing types in the
development does not unreasonably concentrate small lots.
Sec. 2.204 Nonresidential Districts and Mixed-Use Parcel Standards
A. Generally. The standards that are applicable nonresidential development are provided in Table
2.204, Nonresidential and Mixed Use Standards. The table includes provisions for density,
intensity, utility requirements, and minimum area for the parcel proposed for development.
B. How to Use Table 2.204, Nonresidential and Mixed Use Development Standards. The columns
in Table 2.204, Nonresidential and Mixed Use Development Standards, establish the landscape
area, floor area, utility, and parcel area standards that apply to each of the nonresidential uses.
They are interpreted as follows:
1. The first column, district and development type, reflects the zoning districts (shaded in
orange) and the nonresidential or mixed uses that are allowed.
2. The second column, LSR, reflects the minimum landscape surface ratio for the development
type. LSR is calculated as set out in Section 17.204, Landscape Surface Ratio.
3. The third column, maximum floor area, contains the maximum floor area for the use, which
may be expressed as an absolute maximum, a maximum size for individual buildings, a gross
floor area ratio, or no maximum ("N/A").
4. The fourth column, required utilities, his column indicates if public water and sewer utilities
are required. Requirement for public utilities, either from the City or from an approved
public utility provider, is indicated by "Public," whereas "On-Site" indicates that on-site
potable water and individual septic systems are permitted.
5. The fifth and sixth columns, minimum and maximum area of parcel proposed for
development, indicates the area of land that is required for the development of the
specified use (minimum) and the maximum area of land that is allowed for the specified use
in the district (maximum).
C. How to Use Table 2.204a, Development Standards in Non-Residential Districts. The columns in
Table 2.204a, Nonresidential and Mixed Use Development Standards, establish the landscape
area, floor area, utility, and parcel area standards that apply to each of the nonresidential uses.
They are interpreted as follows:
1. The first column, district and development type, reflects the zoning districts (shaded in
orange) and the nonresidential or mixed uses that are allowed.
2. The second column, Min Permeable Open Space, reflects the minimum permeable open
space for the parcel.
3. The third column, maximum floor area, contains the maximum floor area for the use, which
may be expressed as an absolute maximum, a maximum size for individual buildings, a gross
floor area ratio, or no maximum ("N/A").
4. The fourth column, required utilities, his column indicates if public water and sewer utilities
are required.
5. The fifth column, minimum parcel area, indicates the minimum area of land that is allowed
for the specified use in the district.

Neighborhood Conservation District
A. Generally. This Section sets out the standards for redevelopment, new development, and
expansion of existing single-family homes in the NC district.
Figure 2.401 Single-
Family Detached Lot Standards
Since the proposed addition (shown in yellow below) does not extend past the minimum general side setback line (established by Table

standards of Section 2.402, Alternative Setback Standards for Neighborhood Conservation Districts, do not apply.
B. Standards. The lot and building standards for single-family homes in each neighborhood
conservation subdistrict are set out in Table 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building
Standards, Neighborhood Conservation District. These standards do not make existing
development nonconforming. If an expansion of an existing single-family home would not
comply with the standards of this Section, the proposed expansion will be evaluated pursuant to

Sec. 2.402 Alternative Setback Standards for Neighborhood Conservation District
A. Generally. In the Neighborhood Conservation subdistricts, rigid adherence to inflexible building
setback requirements is often not practical. This Section provides an alternative set of standards
for development, redevelopment, and expansion of existing buildings (as indicated below) within
these subdistricts when the new construction would encroach into the setbacks that are
established by Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building Standards, Neighborhood
Conservation District. See Figure 2.402A, Single-Family Detached Lot Standards.
Figure 2.402A Single-
Family Detached Lot Standards
Since the proposed addition (shown in yellow below) extends past the minimum general side setback line established in Table 2.401, Single-
Family General Lot and Building Standards, Neighborhood Conservation District, the alternative setback standards of this Section would apply
instead of the minimum general standards.
B. Alternative Building Setback Standards; All Setbacks. Alternative setbacks shall be applied only
if it is demonstrated that the standards of the applicable subsection of this Section are met, and
the proposed construction:
1. Does not interfere with planned expansion of right-of-way, and if right-of-way expansion is
planned, the application is evaluated as if the right-of-way has been expanded;
2. Does not result in interference with a utility easement;
3. Does not cause more or faster drainage onto abutting properties or rights-of-way than the
condition that existed before the proposed construction;
4. Does not result in a nonconformity with respect to the building code on either the
applicant's lot or the abutting property;
5. Is built to building code standards (e.g., fire ratings) that would allow construction of the
abutting lot to be built to the same standard along the same setback line;
6. Conforms to building coverage limitations of Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and
Building Standards, Neighborhood Conservation District; and
7. Does not reduce the area provided for parking to fewer than two paved off-street
parking spaces (one or both may be in a garage or carport).
C. Alternative Building Setback Standards; Front Setbacks.
1. New Development; Redevelopment; and Building Expansion. For new development,
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 60
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
redevelopment, or building expansion, front setbacks may be reduced from the standards
set out in Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building Standards, Neighborhood
Conservation District, if it is demonstrated that the proposed new front building setback:
a. Is equal to not more than 10 percent less than the average actual setback of the other
homes on the same side of the same block; and / or
b. For an attached or detached garage, is equal to the average actual front setback to an
attached or detached garage with comparable garage door orientation with respect to
the street (e.g., door faces the street or door is perpendicular to the street) on the same
side of the same block.
2. Building Expansion Only. For building expansions only, front setbacks may be reduced from
the standards set out in Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building Standards,
Neighborhood Conservation District, if compliance with any of the following options is
demonstrated:
a. Option #1. The reduction is 10 percent or less of the required front setback, and the
encroachment will not reduce the depth of a driveway to less than 21 feet in length to
the edge of the sidewalk or ditch or street pavement, whichever edge is closest to the
building;
b. Option #2. The reduction is more than 10 percent of the required front setback, but less
than 25 percent of the required front setback, and:
i. No garage doors that face the street are located in the reduced setback area;
ii. The improvement is not more than 20 feet in height;
iii. If the encroachment is more than 10 feet wide (measured parallel to the front
building line), then it is screened from view from the public right-of-way by a
canopy tree or evergreen tree; and
iv. The encroachment is not more than 30 feet wide or 50 percent of the lot width,
whichever is smaller.
c. Option #3. The existing building encroaches upon the setback set out in Section 2.401,
Single-Family General Lot and Building Standards, Neighborhood Conservation District,
on the effective date, and:
i. The proposed construction will not reduce the depth of a driveway to less than 21
feet in length to the edge of the sidewalk or ditch or street pavement, whichever is
closest to the building;
ii. The proposed construction will be set back not less than 90 percent of the setback
to the existing building; and
iii. The proposed construction will not create the appearance of a monolithic building
frontage by substantially reducing the articulation of the building as viewed from
the street.
D. Alternative Building Setback Standards; Interior Side Setbacks.
1. New Development; Redevelopment; and Building Expansion. For new development,
redevelopment, or building expansion, interior side setbacks may be reduced from the
standards set out in Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building Standards,
Neighborhood Conservation District, if it is demonstrated that the proposed side building
setback is equal to not more than the average actual side building setback of the other
ARTICLE 2 DISTRICT INTENSITY AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PAGE 61
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
homes on the same side of the same block.
2. Building Expansion Only. For building expansion only, interior side setbacks may be reduced
from the standards set out in Section 2.401, Single-Family General Lot and Building
Standards, Neighborhood Conservation District, up to 40 percent if it is demonstrated that
the proposed construction meets all of the following standards:
a. Limit of Encroachment
i. If the lot that abuts the proposed building expansion is used for residential
purposes, then:
a. The building expansion is screened from view from the public street by at least
one tree per story of the building expansion, unless it projects into the
required side setback less than one foot further towards the lot line than
the existing building;
b. Building expansions that are 12 feet in height (measured from the average
grade across the side of the proposed construction facing the abutting lot) or
less are set back at least 42 inches from the side lot line (see, e.g., Figure
2.402B, Limit of Encroachment, One-Story Addition); and
c. Building expansions that are more than 12 feet in height (measured from the
average grade across the side of the proposed construction facing the abutting
lot) are set back at least five feet from the side lot line (see, e.g., Figure 2.402C,
Limit of Encroachment, Two-Story Addition).
ii. If the lot that abuts the proposed building expansion is used for nonresidential
purposes or permanent open space that is at least 20 feet in width, then the
building expansion is set back at least 42 inches from the side lot line.

Limit of Encroachment, Two-Story Addition
b. Horizontal Dimension. The building expansion, combined with the existing building,
does not create a horizontal dimension of more than 50 feet without an offset in the
building wall of at least three feet.
c. Windows. The building expansion does not include a window that is located directly
across from another window on a residential building that is closer than 20 feet away,
unless:
i. The window is on the first floor and an opaque fence is installed between the two
buildings to a height of six feet; or
ii. The window is not operational and is made of glass block or frosted glass.
F. Alternative Building Setback Standards; Rear Setbacks.
1. Rear setbacks may be reduced on any lot if it is demonstrated that the proposed rear
building setback is equal to not more than 10 percent less than the average actual setback
of the other homes on the same side of the same block.
2. Rear setbacks may be reduced on lots with rear lot lines that abut permanent open space,
and through lots with fences or walls that screen rear yards from arterials and collectors,
according to the following standards:
b. For construction, or portions of construction, that is 18 feet or less in height (measured
from the average grade across the side of the proposed construction facing the rear lot
line), the rear setback may be reduced by up to 50 percent if it is demonstrated that:
i. The proposed construction will not create the appearance of a monolithic building
by substantially reducing the articulation of the building as viewed from abutting
property, open space, or public rights-of-way; or
ii. The proposed construction is located behind an opaque fence or garden wall that is
at least five feet in height, and one evergreen or canopy tree is planted in the rear
yard for each 12 feet of width of the encroaching portion of the proposed
construction.
c. For construction, or portions of construction, that is more than 18 feet in height
(measured from the average grade across the side of the proposed construction facing
the rear lot line), the rear setback may be reduced up to 30 percent if it is demonstrated
that the standards of subsection E.1.a., above, are met.

2. Chain link fences are permitted only in interior side yards and rear yards (including rear
yards that face alleys) that are not also street yards.
3. The following materials are prohibited: plywood; sheet metal; plastic; fiberglass sheets;
barbed wire, spikes, nails, or other sharp point or instrument on top or sides of a fence
(except as provided in subsection C.4., below); welded wire; agricultural fencing; and poultry
mesh (chicken wire) or hardware cloth.
4. Barbed wire cradles facing inward toward the property may be placed on top of fences
enclosing buildings where the City finds that such are necessary to address a critical security
interest. Fences with barbed wire shall be completely screened with a hedge that will be no
less than the height of the fence within two years of planting.
E. Fence Orientation. The finished side of all fences shall face out toward neighboring property or

ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
Division 5.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 5.101 Purpose and Authority
A. Purposes. The purposes of this Article are to ensure that:
1. Each sign user has a reasonable opportunity to provide information, identification and/or
direction to a permitted use;
2. The reasonable, orderly, and effective display of outdoor commercial and noncommercial
messages, while remaining consistent with all relevant national and state policies to protect the
public investment in highways;
3. The unique "small town" character and quality of the City, which is essential to its economic,
cultural, and social welfare, is protected and preserved;
4. The Citys property values, which are essential to the Citys sustainability and the general
welfare of its residents, institutions, businesses, and industries, are maintained and enhanced;
5. The safety of the public and the viability of commercial corridors are promoted by reducing:
a. Sign clutter;
b. Conflicts between and among signs; and
c. The incidence of certain design elements that tend to distract motorists;
6. The character of the community is protected by promoting proper maintenance of signs and
requiring removal of abandoned signs and dilapidated signs;
7. The number, size, scale, proportions, design and balance of signs are regulated according to
content-neutral standards that are based on architectural quality and character; and
8. The beauty, order and attractiveness of the City to its residents, tourists and visitors, is
maintained and enhanced, and thus the economic prosperity of the City and the region is
positively influenced.
B. Authority. The City Council finds that:
1. The City has the authority to regulate signs under the United States Constitution, the
Constitution of the State of Louisiana, and the City Charter of the City of Zachary;
2. This Article advances important and substantial governmental interests;
3. The regulations set out in this Article are unrelated to the suppression of constitutionallyprotected
free expression and do not involve the content of protected messages which may be
displayed on signs, nor do they involve the viewpoint of individual speakers;
4. The incidental restriction on the freedom of speech is no greater than is essential to the
furtherance of the interests protected by this Article; and
PAGE 112 ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
v. 7.13.2010
5. Certain types of speech are not protected by the First Amendment due to the harm that they
cause to individuals or the community, and speech that is harmful to minors may be prohibited
in places that are accessible to minors.
C. General Findings of Fact. The City Council finds that:
1. The ability to display signs of reasonable size and dimensions is vital to the health and
sustainability of many businesses, and the display of signs with noncommercial messages is a
traditional component of the freedom of speech;
2. The City has an important and substantial interest in preventing sign clutter (which is the
proliferation of signs of increasing size and dimensions as a result of competition among
property owners for the attention of passing motorists), because sign clutter degrades the
character of the community, makes the community a less attractive place for commerce and
private investment, and dilutes all of the messages displayed along the City's streets by creating
visual confusion and aesthetic blight;
3. Sign clutter can be prevented by regulations that balance the legitimate needs of individual
property owners to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages against the
comparable needs of adjacent and nearby property owners and the interest of the community
in providing for a high quality community character;
4. Temporary signs that are not constructed of weather-resistant materials are often damaged or
destroyed by wind, rain, and sun, and after such damage or destruction, degrade the aesthetics
of the City's commercial corridors;
5. The City has an important and substantial interest in keeping its rights-of-way clear of
obstructions and litter;
6. The City has an important and substantial interest in protecting the health of its tree canopy,
which contributes to the character and value of the community; and
7. The uncontrolled use of off-premises outdoor advertising signs and their location, density, size,
shape, motion, illumination and demand for attention can be injurious to the purposes of this
Article, and destructive to community character and property values, and that, as such,
restrictions on the display of off-premises commercial messages are necessary and desirable.
Sec. 5.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. Hereinafter, all construction, relocation, enlargement, alteration, and modification of
signs within the City shall conform to the requirements of this Article, all State and Federal
regulations concerning signs and advertising, and applicable building codes as adopted by the City in
Section 14-1, Uniform Construction Codes -- Codes Adopted, City of Zachary Code of Ordinances, as
may be amended from time to time. Approval of a sign shall be by sign permit, which may be issued
with a building permit.
B. Design Requirements. All signs shall comply with the general design requirements of Division 5.200,
General Design and Maintenance Standards, except as provided in this Section.
C. Signs That Do Not Require Permits. The following signs may be posted in compliance with these
regulations without a sign permit:
ARTICLE 5 SIGNS PAGE 113
v. 7.13.2010
1. Temporary signs, provided that they comply with the general standards of Division 5.200,
General Design and Maintenance Standards, and the standards of Division 5.400, Temporary
Signs;
2. Flags that display a noncommercial message, provided that:
a. Not more than three flagpoles (which may be vertical or mast arm) are installed on the lot
or parcel; and
b. The total area of flags does not exceed 45 square feet (e.g., one flag that is 5 ft. x 9 ft.; or
three flags that are 3 ft. x 5 ft. each).
D. Exempt Signs. The following are exempt from the application of this Article, but may be subject to
building or electrical codes or other Articles of this UDC if they involve structures or equipment that
are regulated by such codes or other Articles:
1. Official traffic signs or sign structures and provisional warning signs or sign structure, when
erected or required to be erected by a governmental agency;
2. Temporary signs designed to call the attention of the public to any detour or public danger;
3. Changing of copy on a message center (electronic or manual);
4. Painting and routine maintenance of sign structures and supports, if the sign area is not
increased and no structural improvements, alterations or replacements are made;
5. Signs that are carried by people (however, such signs are not exempt if they are set down or
propped on objects);
6. Bumper stickers on vehicles;
7. Signs that are not visible from abutting property or public rights of way;
8. Signs that are affixed to a building wall within five feet of the principal entrance to the building
that are:
a. Not more than 5 square feet in area; and
b. Are not legible from the street.
9. Signs that are less than three-fourths of a square foot in area, that are affixed to machines,
equipment, fences, gates, walls, gasoline pumps, public telephones, or utility cabinets; and
10. Holiday decorations that are displayed for not more than two months per year.
E. Exemption for Addressing. The City Council finds that the posting of the addresses of buildings in
locations that are visible from the street is necessary for the effective delivery of public safety
services, including E-911. The efficient and timely delivery of emergency services is a compelling
governmental interest. Accordingly, the City requires that street addresses shall be posted as
follows:
1. In nonresidential districts, street addresses shall be posted at:
a. All primary building entrances; and
b. On detached signage if the address on the building is not visible from the street.
PAGE 114 ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
v. 7.13.2010
2. In residential districts, street addresses shall be posted:
a. On the facade of the building that faces the street from which the address is taken; and
b. On the mailbox or mailbox support, if the mailbox is detached from the building.
3. Because address signs are required, numbers and letters used for addressing are not included
in the calculation of sign area if they are not more than 14 inches in height.
F. Signs Permitted Before Effective Date. If a permit for a sign has been issued in accordance with all
City ordinances in effect prior to the effective date of this Article, and provided that construction is
begun within six months of the effective date of this Article and diligently prosecuted to
completion, said sign may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of
which the permit has been issued, subject thereafter, if applicable, to the provisions of this UDC
regarding nonconforming signs. See Section 12.205, Nonconforming Signs, and Section 12.301,
Termination, Restoration, and Removal.
Division 5.200 General Design and Maintenance Standards
Sec. 5.201 Measurements
A. Generally. The regulations of this Article shall be applied using the measurements set out in this
Section.
B. Sign Area. Sign area is calculated as follows:
1. Generally. The area within a continuous perimeter with up to eight straight sides that encloses
the limits of text and graphics, together with any frame or other material or color forming an
integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign's message from the background
against which it is placed, excluding the structure upon which the sign is placed; but including
any open space contained within the outer limits of the display face of a sign, or between any
component, panel, strip, or figure of any kind composing the display face, whether this open
space is enclosed by a frame or border or not. See Figure 5.201A, Sign Area, Generally, below.
Figure 5.201A
Sign Area, Generally
The sign area of this illustrative monument sign (below) is measured as the area within the smallest eight-sided polygon
that encloses the graphics.
ARTICLE 5 SIGNS PAGE 115
v. 7.13.2010
Figure 5.201A
Sign Area, Generally
The sign area of this illustrative collection of wall signs (below) is measured as the area within the smallest eight-sided
polygon that encloses all of the text and graphics.
2. Double-Faces. For projecting or double-faced signs (see Figure 5.201B, Sign Area, Illustration of
Double-Faced Signs, below), only one display face is measured in computing sign area which
the sign faces are parallel, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less,
provided that the signs are mounted on the same structure. If the two faces of a double-faced
sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the larger face.
Figure 5.201B
Sign Area, Illustration of Double-Faced Signs
C. Clearance. Clearance is the distance between the bottom of a sign and the nearest point on the
surface under it. See Figure 5.201C, Sign Clearance.
PAGE 116 ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
v. 7.13.2010
Figure 5.201C
Sign Clearance
D. Sign Height.
1. Generally. Sign height is the distance from the average grade of the surface under the sign to
the top of the sign or sign structure, whichever is higher. However, chains or brackets that
suspend a shingle sign from a horizontal plane of the building, awning, or canopy are not
counted, provided that:
a. There are no more than three chains or brackets used in the mount, and
b. The chains or brackets are less than three inches in width.
2. Monument Signs. The height of monument signs is measured as provided in subsection D.1.,
unless the surface under the sign is lower than the centerline of the abutting street, in which
case the height is measured from the average elevation of the centerline of the abutting street
along the frontage of the parcel proposed for development to the top of the sign or sign
structure, whichever is higher. See Figure 5.201D, Monument Sign Height.

Division 5.500 Sign Design Program
Sec. 5.501 Sign Design Program Alternative
A. Generally.
1. Purpose. The requirements of Division 5.200, General Design and Maintenance Standards,
Division 5.300, Permanent Signs, and Division 5.400, Temporary Signs, are intended to ensure
that signs that meet certain minimum standards that are consistent with the expected
character and quality of new development in Zachary may be quickly approved and displayed.
For some proposals, alternative standards may contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the
development. Approval of a sign design program pursuant to the standards of this Division
allows for unified presentation of signage throughout a parcel proposed for development,
flexibility to provide for unique environments, and pre-approval of designs and design elements
to make subsequent applications for sign permits more efficient. To this end, a sign design
program alternative is created.
2. Approval Criteria. The Planning Commission may approve a sign design program if it results in a
substantially improved, comprehensive, and unified proposal compared to what is allowed
PAGE 134 ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
v. 7.13.2010
through strict compliance with the sign regulations of this Article. The responsible official shall
review all sign types (e.g., freestanding, attached, window, etc.) for the parcel proposed for
development, to determine the degree of compliance with this Article, and shall report to the
Planning Commission with regard to the degree of deviation from these standards that is
sought by the applicant. The degree of deviation sought by the applicant shall be measured
against the degree of compliance with the standards of this Division.
3. Conditions of Approval. The Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions on a sign
design program that are not related to the content of the signs or the viewpoints of the sign
users, in order to ensure continuing compliance with the standards of this Division and
approved sign design programs.
B. Contents of Sign Design Program. A sign design program shall set forth a master plan for signage
for an entire parcel proposed for development. For example, shopping center sign design programs
shall include all tenants and out parcels, and office or industrial parks shall include all types of signs
for wayfinding and tenants or uses within the development.
1. Sign design programs shall set out:
a. Sign dimensions and approximate locations;
b. Materials and colors;
c. Proposed illumination, including illumination levels;
d. Maximum numbers of items of information per sign face;
e. A design theme with illustrative examples of each sign type and the proposed general
locations of each sign type; and
f. A demonstration that the sign design program will improve the aesthetics of the
development and will not have an adverse impact on the use, enjoyment, or value of
property in adjacent or nearby residential districts.
2. Sign design programs may also set out standards for temporary signage, such as the display of
banners.
C. Effect of Approval. Upon approval of a sign design program, issuance of a sign permit shall be based
on compliance with the standards set out in the sign design program for the parcel proposed for
development.
Sec. 5.502 Flexibility Criteria
A. Generally. Signage which is proposed as part of a sign design program may deviate from the
standards of this Article in terms of the types and numbers of signs allowed, the maximum sign
area, the maximum signable area ratio, and materials and illumination standards (including
electronic message centers), subject to compliance with a sign design program that is approved
according to the flexibility criteria set out in this Section.
B. Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements. Prohibited signs and sign elements are not eligible for inclusion
in a sign design program unless specifically indicated in this Article.
ARTICLE 5 SIGNS PAGE 135
v. 7.13.2010
C. Modification of Sign Setbacks. Setbacks for detached signs may deviate from the requirements of
this Article if it is demonstrated that there is no impact on public safety or utility easements, and all
other requirements for approval of a sign design program are met.
D. Architectural Theme.
1. All signs shall be architecturally integrated into or complimentary to the design of the buildings
and character of the site, and shall use similar and coordinated design features, materials, and
colors. The sign design program shall establish an integrated architectural vocabulary and
cohesive theme for the parcel proposed for development.
2. The design, character, location, and/or materials of all freestanding and attached signs
proposed in a sign design program shall be demonstrably more attractive than signs otherwise
permitted on the parcel proposed for development under the minimum standards of this
Article.
3. The height of all freestanding signs proposed through the sign design program shall relate to
the design of the sign and the scale of the use, and shall not exceed 14 feet in height.
E. Lighting. Lighting standards shall not deviate from the standards of Section 9.501, Nonresidential
Lighting Standards, except as part of a sign design program for a parcel proposed for development
in the UC district, in locations where the lighting:
1. Cannot be seen from outside of the parcel proposed for development;
2. Does not create a sky glow under normal conditions; and
3. Does not shine into windows of residential units located within the district.
F. Height, Area, Number and Location of signs.
1. The height, area, number and location of signs permitted through the sign design program shall
be determined by the Planning Commission based on the following criteria:
a. The overall size of the parcel proposed for development and the scale of the use or uses
located or anticipated to be located there (larger land areas and scales of use tend to favor
larger signs and / or more signs);
b. Relationship between the building setback and sign location (additional signage may be
appropriate for buildings with less visibility, particularly where buffering is providing an
aesthetic and / or environmental benefit to the City);
c. Frontage (larger frontages may justify more or larger signs, particularly if the size of the
frontage tends to prevent sign clutter from multiple adjacent parcels);
d. Access and visibility to the site;
e. Intended traffic circulation pattern and the need for wayfinding;
f. Hierarchy of signage;
g. Relationship between the site and adjacent uses; and
h. The desired function of the site (e.g., an urban center would tend to include signage that is
more urban and more dynamic in character than a strip shopping center).
PAGE 136 ARTICLE 5 SIGNS
v. 7.13.2010
2. Additionally, the maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the following formula when
evaluated against the above criteria:
a. The maximum area permitted for attached signage shall range from one percent up to a
maximum of six percent of the building facade to which the sign is to be attached.
b. The maximum total permitted area of all freestanding signs on a parcel proposed for
development shall not exceed 20 percent more than the total sign area that would
otherwise be permitted by this Article.
G. Community Character. The signage proposed in a sign design program shall not have an adverse
impact on the community character of the district in which the parcel proposed for development is
located, or of the City of Zachary.
H. Property Values. The signage proposed in a sign design program will not have an adverse impact on
the value of property in the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development.
I. Elimination of Nonconforming Signs. If there are existing signs on-site, they shall be removed or
brought into conformance with the standards of the approved sign design program.

tenants or successors in title shall be included in a declaration of covenants, conditions, and
restrictions for the property that shall be recorded in the public records in the chain of title for the
property at the applicant's expense. The applicant shall provide proposed covenants, conditions,
and restrictions to the City:
1. Upon filing the application for final plat approval; or
2. If no plat approval is sought, before the issuance of any permit that directly authorizes
development (development approvals that require covenants, conditions, or restrictions shall
be contingent upon approval of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions document).
B. Plat Annotations. Requirements regarding maintenance of common areas or operation and
maintenance of drainage facilities shall be summarized on the plat and set forth in full in the
declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions, which shall be referenced on the plat.
C. City Enforcement.
1. The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Attorney shall review covenants, conditions, and
restrictions that implement requirements of this UDC or conditions of approval.
2. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require that the applicant grant the City a right of
enforcement of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions, in order to ensure continuing
compliance. To this end, the City may require that the CCRs give the City a right to designate a
management company, to be paid a reasonable fee from the dues payable by the property
owners, after the third notice of noncompliance to the association's registered agent. The
management company shall be responsible for remedying violations that are the subject of the
notices.
Sec. 6.303 Optional Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions
A. Generally. The City shall approve only those covenants, conditions, and restrictions that relate to
the development approval, and its right of enforcement shall extend only to those matters and
matters that substantially bear upon them. The City will not seek to intervene in purely private
disputes about covenants, conditions, and restrictions.
B. Optional Elements. The CCRs may include any provisions considered desirable by the applicant with
respect to the management and maintenance of the subdivision or condominium, provided that
they do not undermine the following requirements:
1. Required membership in, and payment of dues to, the Property Owners' Association.
2. Inclusion and enforcement of all of the provisions required by these regulations and any
conditions of approval, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney;
3. Clauses that provides for enforceability by the City of those covenants, conditions, and
restrictions that relate to these regulations or conditions of approval; and
4. Applicable requirements of this UDC at the time of approval of the CCR document.
ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PAGE 141
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 6.304 Conversions from Unified Control to Multiple Ownership
A development that is approved under unified ownership and control shall not be conveyed into
multiple ownerships (e.g., individual buildings in an office park being sold to separate entities) until the
required CCRs are recorded.
Division 6.400 Subdivision and Development Design
Sec. 6.401 Development Design Review Principles
A. Generally. It is the policy of the City that the principles of this Section be applied to the maximum
extent possible without imposing restrictions that reduce the density or intensity of development
that is permitted on the subject property by this UDC. The City may require modifications to
proposed site plans or subdivision plats that otherwise conform to the standards of the UDC in
order to enhance the quality of the design in accordance with the qualitative principles of this
Section. The standards of this Section shall be applied and interpreted in the context of the other
applicable standards that are set out in other Articles of this UDC.
B. Compatibility. The proposed site plan or subdivision plat shall be designed in a way that:
1. Provides appropriate space for buffers and transitions between incompatible land uses or
obvious changes in density or intensity alongside and rear lot lines;
2. Provides appropriate vehicular and pedestrian linkages between residential uses and retail,
service, and office uses, providing access while protecting neighborhood integrity;
3. Protects neighboring property from stormwater runoff;
4. Anticipates and provides for future vehicular and pedestrian connections to neighboring
properties that are likely to be developed or redeveloped with similar or supportive land uses
within ten years;
5. Minimizes interference with existing access to adjacent and nearby properties, unless new and
improved access is provided by the proposed development; and
6. Does not materially reduce the level of service of public utilities that are provided to
surrounding development.
C. Consistency with City Capital Improvement Plans. The proposed development shall conform to all
adopted and applicable capital improvement plans of the City, East Baton Rouge Parish (for capital
improvement plans within the City), and the State of Louisiana with regard to public infrastructure
and facilities, including water, sewer, gas, streets, trails, and parks and recreation.
D. Flood Damage Prevention. See Chapter 46, Flood Damage Prevention, City of Zachary Code of
Ordinances.
E. Future Adjacent Development. The proposed development shall be designed in a way that shows
how future development of adjacent parcels under common ownership will relate to the parcel
proposed for development in terms of transportation linkages and utilities.
F. Landscaping. The subdivision landscaping layout shall promote the zoning district's qualities and
character and meet or exceed the standards therein. Bufferyard landscaping shall be located to
PAGE 142 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
achieve the screening objectives and, where possible, enhance open space objectives beyond the
minimum requirements.
G. Preservation of Density and Intensity. Design review is intended to permit plan modifications that
improve design, but not to require a density or intensity reduction. The design review shall focus on
revising the site plan by altering roads, lots, landscaping, or other plan elements, but not by altering
development density or intensity unless the density or intensity exceeds permitted standards or the
open space, buffering, landscaping, or resource protection does not meet the requirements of this
UDC.
Sec. 6.402 Streets
A. Alignment of Subdivision Streets with Existing Streets.
1. Streets shall be configured as required by Section 8.202, Street Standards.
2. Streets shall, to the extent practicable, align with existing streets, and be given the name of the
streets with which they align, or shall be offset the minimum distance specified in the
Engineering Standards Manual. See Division 8.400, Engineering Standards Manual.
B. Alignment of Local Streets with Arterials and Collectors. Generally, local roads or streets shall be
either:
1. Perpendicular to arterials or collectors; or
2. Loop streets, reverse frontage roads, or cul-de-sacs (which are limited by Section 8.205, Cul-de-
Sacs. See Figure 6.402, Local Street Orientation.
Table 6.402
Local Street Orientation
C. Width of Public Ways. The minimum width of public street rights-of-way in subdivisions shall be
established according to the functional classification of each street, pursuant to Section 8.202,
Street Standards.
ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PAGE 143
v. 7.13.2010
D. Grades and Curves of Public Ways. The City Engineer shall promulgate the requirements for grades
and curves of public ways in the Engineering Standards Manual. See Division 8.400, Engineering
Standards Manual.
Sec. 6.403 Blocks
A. Block Pattern. In general, streets shall be laid out to create blocks. Within any superblock created
by arterials or collectors, the design objective is to provide an interconnected network of streets
and pathways so that people may reach other locations within the superblock by walking or
bicycling or driving, but without having to access arterial or collector streets with vehicles. See
Figure 6.403A, Illustrative Block Pattern in Superblock to Create Connectivity. If practicable, streets
shall be arranged in a loose grid or comparable formal arrangement, and open spaces shall be
integrated into the block design. Exceptions will be made for green spaces along drainage or stream
channels or where other natural resources make a grid or comparable formal arrangement difficult
or cost prohibitive.
Figure 6.403A
Illustrative Block Pattern in Superblock to Create Connectivity
B. Block Orientation. Where possible, blocks shall be laid out to have their short length abutting
arterials, collectors, or the development's major internal street. The length, width, and shape of
blocks should be determined with due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the
type proposed, zoning requirements, fire access, emergency service, and police protection. See
Figure 6.403B, Block Length.
C. Block Length and Width.
1. Blocks should not, in most instances, exceed the lengths specified in Table 6.403A, Block
Length. Blocks may exceed the lengths in Table 6.403A, Block Length, provided that the blocks
are the minimum additional length necessary to achieve a stated design objective, and either:
PAGE 144 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
a. The block traverses a span of open space that is wider than the distance specified in the
table; or
b. Mid-block access is provided that allows pedestrian circulation from the block to another
block (or, in TND "Center" subdistricts, to parking areas behind buildings). Such access shall
be provided at intervals of not less than 300 feet, including street intersections.
2. Blocks should be such width as will provide two tiers of lots, except:
a. Where reverse frontage lots are located along an arterial or collector street;
b. Where such an arrangement is prevented by the size or other inherent site conditions of
the property; or
c. Where lots are arranged in a cluster format that promotes visual access to common open
space by reducing back-to-back residential lots.

D. Nonresidential Blocks. Blocks for commercial, industrial, and mixed-use areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this Section if the nature of the use requires other treatment. See
Figure 6.403C, Nonresidential Blocks. In such cases, safe and convenient access to the street and
pathway systems shall be required. Space for off-street parking may also require similar access for
employees and customers. Extension of streets and utilities shall be provided, as necessary.
Figure 6.403C
Nonresidential Blocks
Sec. 6.404 Lots
A. Minimum Width. The minimum width of lots in a subdivision shall be as set out in:
1. Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards, for the applicable zoning district and
development type; or
2. A pattern book for a TND that is approved according to the standards of Section 14.504,
Pattern Book Requirements.
B. Minimum Depth. The minimum depth of lots in a subdivision shall be:
1. As required to achieve the minimum lot area (lot depth equals lot width divided by lot area) set
out in Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards, for the applicable zoning district
and development type; or
2. The depth indicated in a pattern book for a TND that is approved according to the standards of
Section 14.504, Pattern Book Requirements.
C. Minimum Area. The minimum area of lots in a subdivision shall be as set out in:
1. Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards, for the applicable zoning district and
development type; or
2. A pattern book for a TND that is approved according to the standards of Section 14.504,
Pattern Book Requirements.
PAGE 146 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
D. Required Frontage. All lots that are not subject to a conservation easement or used as common
elements or recreational areas shall front upon an improved public street, unless it is demonstrated
that a private street subdivision is approved that complies with Section 8.204, Private Streets.
E. Lot Shape, Generally.
1. Generally, lots shall be rectangular or "pie-shaped." All side lines of lots shall be at right angles
to straight street lines, or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation to this rule will give a
better street and lot plan.
2. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit the establishment of front building setback line on
both the front and the side of the lots adjoining the streets irrespective of whether the rear lot
lines of said corner lots abut lots fronting on the side streets.
3. Lots on major street intersections and at all acute angle intersections which, the Planning and
Zoning Commission finds are likely to be dangerous to the traffic movement shall have a radius
of 20 feet at the street corner. Where grade separation structures are proposed at the
intersection of major streets, the lots and improvements in the subdivision shall be arranged so
as to make adequate provisions for such structures.
F. Lot Shape, Alternative. Alternative lot shapes may be approved in any of the following
circumstances:
1. In General.
a. The alternative shape does not interfere with the efficient development of other property;
and
b. The lots allow for a building envelope that is adequate for conventional building design.
The building pad used meets minimum lot width where the home is to located. The City
shall require a building pad designation on the plat. See Figure 6.404A, Building Envelope.
Figure 6.404A
Building Envelope
2. Irregularly Shaped Parcel Proposed for Development. The shape of the parcel required irregular
lots in order to subdivide.
3. Preservation of Open Space with Trapezoidal Lots. Trapezoidal lots are encouraged in cluster
development because they better enable the land planner to adjust to curvilinear roads or culde-
sacs by increasing the total open space area of the site. Figure 6.404B, Preservation of Open
ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PAGE 147
v. 7.13.2010
Space, compares the use of trapezoidal lots to the use of conservation easements on private
lots.
Figure 6.404B
Preservation of Open Space
4. Curvilinear Streets. Irregular lots are permitted where the street alignment would otherwise
force larger, pie shaped lots and the use of irregular lots would allow for smaller lots and more
access to open space. See Figure 6.404C, Curvilinear Streets.
Figure 6.404C
Curvilinear Streets
PAGE 148 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
5. Large Lots. Where lots exceeding three acres are provided, the lot shape that provides efficient
use of the land and minimum lot size may be used. See Figure 6.404D, Large Lots.
Figure 6.404D
Large Lots
G. Access to Lots.
1. No residential lots shall front on collector or arterial roads or streets unless:
a. They have alley access to parking and on-street parking is permitted on the arterial or
collector; or
b. They are three acres or larger in area and have a minimum frontage of 250 feet along the
collector or arterial.
2. Residential lots in the "Center" and "General" subdistricts of TNDs shall be accessed by alleys.
Sec. 6.405 Easements
A. Generally. During development approval, the City may require the granting of a variety of
easements on private property or lots. These easements may be for any of the following, or other
approved, purposes:
1. Drainage;
2. Utilities;
3. Access to public utilities or drainage areas;
4. Fire protection;
5. Police protection and other emergency services;
6. Solid waste removal;
7. Pedestrian access; and
8. Natural resource or open space conservation.
B. Utility Easement Width and Location. Where required, all lots shall provide utility easements (U.E.)
for sewer, water, gas, drainage, electricity, cable, fiber-to-the-home, or other public utilities that are
necessary or desirable to serve the subdivision. Their width and location shall be such that access
and maintenance, repair or reconstruction can be accomplished without undue hardship to the
utility. Easement standards may be included in the Engineering Standards Manual.
ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PAGE 149
v. 7.13.2010
C. Drainage Easements. To the extent possible, existing surface drainage patterns serving any off-site
properties or two or more proposed lots or properties shall be protected by easements or open
space. In addition, drainage easements shall be placed on lots to convey surface water to storm
sewers located on the street or to surface drainage channels located in easements or open spaces
as topography and grading dictate.
D. Fire Protection Easements. Rear fire protection access easements, where necessary to provide
adequate protection for the structure, shall be improved as appropriate for fire protection
equipment, at a width of 20 feet, with appropriate turning radii for the City's fire protection
equipment as determined by the Fire Department.
E. Pedestrian Access Easements. Pedestrian access easements may be required in accordance with
Division 8.200, Streets, Sidewalks, and Trails.
F. Conservation Easements.
1. The City shall require conservation easements to preserve open space as required by this UDC,
and to protect natural resources that this UDC requires to be protected.
2. Conservation easements shall exclude other easements that would result in the disturbance of
the land, except that pedestrian access easements and non-destructive utility and drainage
easements are permitted within areas protected by conservation easements.
3. Conservation easements shall provide for permanent management and maintenance of the
property by a responsible party other than the City, such as a nonprofit land trust or property
owners' association.
4. All conservation easements shall run in favor of two parties:
a. All lots or unit owners in the development; and
b. The City.
5. The conservation easements shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney.
G. Encroachments and Removal of Encroachments. No permanent encroachment or structures shall
be allowed to be located within the area of any easement required by this Section. While the City or
utility benefiting from the easement will make efforts to minimize disturbances, both shall have the
right to remove any encroachment, structures, fences, landscaping or other improvements placed
upon such easements. The City and/or utility shall not be obligated to restore or replace any such
encroachment but shall restore any disturbed ground surfaces with seeding. The City may assess
the cost of removing an unauthorized improvement from an easement against the landowner,
including the placing of a lien on the property.
H. Maintenance of Easements. The responsibility for the regular maintenance of the ground surface in
any easement shall rest with the owner of the property within which the easement exists.
Sec. 6.406 Open Spaces
A. Generally. This Section is designed to achieve the open space requirements of bufferyards, resource
protection, recreation, stormwater management, and preservation of community character.
PAGE 150 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
B. Design.
1. Generally, open spaces shall be integrated into the development design to bring significant
open space to the maximum number of properties, as well as visibility from public rights-ofway
within the proposed development. Visual or physical access to open spaces may be limited
if such limitations would materially enhance natural resource management.
2. Open space shall be designed to provide greenways along drainage corridors and streams. The
landscaping along corridors or streams shall be designed to enhance the filtering of surface and
subsurface water flows. Trails shall provide access along the greenway for the residents of the
proposed development.
3. Formal open spaces shall be designed to provide areas of focus within the development.
Landscaping and furniture for pedestrians shall be installed to enhance this effect.
Sec. 6.407 Utilities
A. Generally.
1. All developments shall make provision for water, sewer, stormwater, electric, telephone, and
cable service, and may make provision for fiber-to-the-home and other public and/or private
utilities available to City residents. Where on-site water and sewer are allowed by Division
2.200, Standards for Parcels Proposed for Development, on-site systems will satisfy this
requirement.
2. All drainage and utilities shall be efficiently and unobtrusively integrated into the design and
shall avoid off-site impacts.
B. Capacity. Where a parcel proposed for development is part of a larger tract of land, the City shall
require the capacity of facilities to be adequate to serve the entire tract to the extent that the
capacity is matched to that of the lines that are extended to the parcel proposed for development.
Where the parcel proposed for development is part of a larger utility service area, the City may
require the capacity of the appropriate facilities to be adequate to serve the remainder of the
service area.
C. Potable Water Line Loops. Potable water lines shall be looped and shall have a secondary feed to
the potable water supply.
D. Interceptors. Where an interceptor is to be extended through the area being developed, the
landowner shall provide the necessary easements.
E. Common Use Easements. Wherever possible, the City shall require compatible utilities to share
easements. See Section 6.405, Easements.
Sec. 6.408 Required Improvements; Upgrade Agreements
A. Design and Installation of Improvements.
1. All improvements required by this UDC and related City regulations shall be designed and
installed in accordance with the Engineering Standards Manual.
ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PAGE 151
v. 7.13.2010
2. All improvements shall be furnished, installed, and constructed by the applicant at no cost to
the City, except as specifically provided in this UDC. Escrows or sureties may be required for
off-site improvements that are required by this UDC.
B. Utility Upgrade Agreement. The City may require that the applicant upgrade the capacity of
municipal utility lines in order to provide adequate facilities to future development in the area of
the proposed development. To this end, the City Council may authorize the Mayor to enter into a
participation agreement or development agreement that sets out the City's share of additional
costs of standard line sizes, and the method and timing of repayment to the applicant. The written
agreement shall fairly apportion the cost of providing the upgraded capacity, and shall be executed
between the applicant and the City prior to the final approval of plans and specifications.
Sec. 6.409 Development Phasing
A. Generally. A parcel proposed for development may be developed in phases, which each phase
separately platted. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a concept plan with the first application
for preliminary plat approval. The concept plan shall show compliance with this UDC by showing:
1. The general arrangements of streets and utilities, and how they will connect to the streets
shown on the first application for preliminary plat approval;
2. The general location of drainage facilities;
3. The general location of protected natural resources; and
4. The general location of proposed uses and housing types.
B. Consistency with Concept Plan. In considering each subsequent phase shown on a concept plan,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may impose conditions that are necessary to assure the
orderly development of the platted land. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to,
temporary alley and street extensions, temporary cul-de-sacs, and off-site utility extensions.

1. Single-Family Residential (all detached and attached types, including manufactured). For new
subdivision developments, 50 percent of the utilities infrastructure fee assessed for each lot
must be paid by the developer of the new subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. The
remaining balance of the utilities infrastructure fee per lot shall be paid by the purchaser of the
lot, the builder, or the property owner of the lot prior to the issuance of a building or
occupancy permit.
2. Multiplex, Multifamily, and Manufactured Home Park (rental pads). For multiplex, multifamily,
and manufactured home park developments, the developer must pay 100 percent of the
utilities infrastructure fee assessed prior to issuance of the occupancy permit.
3. Nonresidential. For nonresidential new construction or remodeling, the developer or owner
must pay 100 percent of the utilities infrastructure fee assessed prior to issuance of the
occupancy permit.
Sec. 6.502 Recreation
Consideration shall be given by the developer to the dedication or reservation of suitable sites for parks,
playgrounds, and other areas for public use so as to conform to the recommendations of the Planning
and Zoning Commission in its adopted master plan or portion thereof of the city. Areas to be dedicated
or reserved for schools, parks and playgrounds should be indicated on the preliminary plan in order that
it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be dedicated to, or acquired by the
appropriate taxing agency. In general, whenever the proposed subdivision contains 20 acres or includes
more than 100 lots, consideration shall be given to the reservation or dedication of a suitable area for
school and recreation purposes.
Division 6.600 Mapping and Monuments
Sec. 6.601 Protected Resources
A. Generally. All subdivisions and site plans that include areas of protected natural resources shall
show the boundaries of areas of protected natural resources, if such exist on the site. Such
delineation shall be by a registered professional land surveyor.
B. Mapping Criteria. The following criteria shall be used for mapping natural resources:
1. Streams (perennial, intermittent, mapped, and unmapped) with identifiable banks and beds
shall have their boundaries set at the top of the bank.
2. Initial identification of the water courses/water bodies shall be made using the U.S. Geological
Survey quadrangle maps or more accurate information, as available. Field survey verification to
determine evidence and location of channelized flow is required for primary plats and site
plans.
3. Woodlands shall be measured at the canopy line.
4. Wetlands shall be delineated by the criteria promulgated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
PAGE 154 ARTICLE 6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
v. 7.13.2010
C. Boundaries. Boundaries shall be drawn as follows:
1. Measurements for boundaries are to be made horizontally, perpendicular from, or radial from
any feature or point.
2. Boundaries that are dependent on elevation shall be based upon on-site elevations and shall
not be interpolated.
D. Topography. Topographic lines shall be at one-foot contour intervals unless such intervals are
impractical due to essentially flat topography.
Sec. 6.602 Monumentation
A. Generally. Monuments shall be placed to mark the following:
1. Lot corners, points of curvature, points of tangency, and reference points; and
2. Street centerlines, points of curvature, points of tangency, and reference points.
B. Monument Requirements. The following guidelines apply to artificial monuments to be set.

v. 7.13.2010
ARTICLE 7 STORM WATER
MANAGEMENT
Division 7.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 7.101 Purpose
A. Findings of Fact.
1. It is hereby determined that:
a. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the
hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and
volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
b. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and
c. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and
minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
2. The City recognizes that water quality and quantity requirements of federal, state, and parish
laws applicable to surface waters provide reasonable guidance for the control of stormwater
runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation.
3. It is determined that the control of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
projects and other construction activities in order to manage and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent
threats to public health and safety.
B. Purpose of Regulations that Apply to Permanent Controls and Maintenance. The purpose of
Division 7.200, Drainage, is to ensure that stormwater management requirements and controls are
in place to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public. Division
7.200, Drainage, requires plans that are reviewed according to performance standards promulgated
by East Baton Rouge Parish, the State of Louisiana, and the federal government, depending upon
the circumstances of the individual application. It also includes specifications for construction of
drainage facilities.
C. Purpose of Regulations that Apply to Construction Activities. During the construction process, soil
is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable
species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In
addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat. Consequently, the purpose of Division 7.300, Stormwater
Management During Construction, is to implement federal laws that seek to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment.
PAGE 156 ARTICLE 7 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 7.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. Drainage plans and stormwater pollution prevention programs (for construction
activities) are required as provided in federal and state law.
B. When Required. Article 7, Storm Water Management, is applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption. The ordinance also applies to land development
activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a
larger common plan of development that is not exempt, even though multiple separate and distinct
land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all
plans must also be reviewed by federal, state, and local environmental protection officials with
jurisdiction to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after
development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans.
C. Construction with Other Articles and Ordinances. This Article is not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any other Article, ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of
law. The requirements of this Article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any
provision of this Article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other Article,
ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or
impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to
take precedence.

polyethylene shall meet the requirements of ASTM F794, and shall be sized using Manning's
Roughness Coefficient as recommended by the pipe's manufacturer. Other pipe materials which are
equal to or superior to the above materials may be utilized if approved by the city prior to
submission of the drainage impact analysis.
D. Changing or Altering Existing Drainage Channels. No individual, partnership, or corporation shall
deepen, widen, fill, re-route or change the location of any existing ditch, stream, drain, or drainage
canal without first obtaining written permission from the city engineer and the public works
director. Such deepening, widening, filling, re-routing or changing the location of any existing ditch,
stream, drain or drainage canal shall be constructed under the supervision of the city engineer and
be approved by the planning and zoning commission as part of the drainage impact analysis.
Adequate servitude or rights-of-way must be obtained at the cost of the developer and dedicated to
public use for the construction and maintenance of any channels which may be relocated. Any such
relocation must be by subsurface drainage under terms, conditions and specifications approved by
the public works director or the city engineer. The city shall not be required to pipe preexisting
open ditches, but if a landowner decides to pipe an open ditch, the landowner must do so according
to the specifications promulgated by the city engineer, and the piping of the ditch must be
approved by the city department of public works.
E. Servitude for Existing Drainage Channels. Whenever any stream or improved surface drainage
course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall dedicate an adequate

for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer.
Sec. 7.206 Continuing Maintenance
A. Generally. Continuing maintenance of stormwater management facilities is required pursuant to
this Section.
B. Maintenance Easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has an stormwater management
facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a
maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by
the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City, or its contractor or agent, and for regular or
special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working
condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this Article. The
easement agreement shall be recorded in the public records of East Baton Rouge Parish, and if
associated with a plat, shall be identified on the recorded plat.
C. Maintenance Covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the City and
recorded upon final plan approval and prior to the issuance of a building permit. As part of the
covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure
proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for
periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
1. Requirements of Maintenance Covenants. All stormwater management facilities must undergo,
at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure
ARTICLE 7 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PAGE 161
v. 7.13.2010
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and accomplishment of its purposes. These
needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape
vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as
determined by the City, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as
deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility.
2. Inspection of Stormwater Facilities. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable
basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based
upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants;
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical
discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing
maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and
material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control
facilities and other stormwater treatment practices.
3. Right of Entry for Inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private
property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage
control system the property owner shall grant to the City or other appropriate enforcement
agency the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis
to believe that a violation of this Article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when
necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this Article.
D. Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities. Parties responsible for the operation and
maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all
maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five years. These records shall be
made available to the City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.
E. Failure to Maintain Practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, the City, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design
standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper
working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to
public safety or public health, the City shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the
stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person
shall have not more than seven days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved
manner, which may be reduced if justified by the level of danger posed. After proper notice, the
City may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties.
F. Dedication in Lieu of Covenant. In lieu of an maintenance covenant, the City may, in its discretion,
accept dedication (or allow dedication to another appropriate entity) of any existing or future
stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements
PAGE 162 ARTICLE 7 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT

required to serve a proposed development.
B. Calculations. The number of parking spaces that are required for a development relates to one or
more independent variables, such as floor area, seating capacity, projected full time equivalent
employees, number and type of dwelling units, and so forth.
1. Measurements. The independent variables shall be measured as follows:
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 180
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
a. Floor Area: Where the number of parking spaces in Section 9.202, Required Parking and
Loading, is calculated based on the floor area of the use, or floor area put to a specified
aspect of the use, the measurement of floor area shall not include restrooms, utility rooms
(electrical and phone rooms, trash rooms, and custodial closets), elevator cores, and areas
of commercial and institutional uses that are designed and used exclusively for incidental
storage.
b. Seats: One seat is equal to:
i. One fixed seat;
ii. 30 inches of bench seating; or
iii. 20 square feet of floor area used for temporary seating.
c. Capacity:
i. For indoor uses, capacity shall be measured pursuant to the requirements of the
applicable fire code.
ii. For outdoor uses, capacity shall be measured by the estimated number of persons
present during periods of peak use.
iii. Number of beds shall be measured by the design capacity of an institutional
residential, protective care, or residential eldercare use.
2. Calculations. The number of required parking spaces is calculated according to the formulae set
out in Section 9.202, Required Parking and Loading, and then adjusted as follows:
a. First, according to the standards of Section 9.203, Parking Credits, if applicable; and
b. Second, according to the standards of Section 9.204, Mixed Uses and Shared Parking, if
applicable.
3. Rounding. If the final calculation of the number of required parking spaces includes a fractional
space, the number of required parking spaces is rounded up to the nearest whole number,
regardless of the fraction.
C. Multiple Nonresidential Uses. If several nonresidential uses occupy a single parcel or building, the
off-street parking and loading requirements shall be the cumulative total for all uses, unless:
1. The uses are of different categories, such that the standards of Section 9.204, Mixed Uses and
Shared Parking, apply; or
2. The uses are in a center with multiple retail, service, or restaurant tenants, which shall be
classified cumulatively as "shopping center" for the purposes of parking requirements. See
Section 9.202, Required Parking and Loading, subsection D.

K. Uses Not Listed. The responsible official shall determine the parking requirements for uses that are
not listed based on:
1. The uses in this Section that are most similar to the proposed uses; or
2. Parking studies of similar uses that are provided by the applicant and certified by a qualified
professional engineer.
Sec. 9.203 Parking Credits
A. Generally. This section sets out credits and permissible reductions in the number of off-street parking
spaces that must be provided. Based on the provision of alternative parking or transportation demand
management programs that tend to reduce the demand for parking spaces.
B. On-Street and Public Lot Parking. In the UC district, and in approved traditional neighborhood
developments ("TNDs"), on-street parking and parking in public lots may be credited to particular
uses in accordance with the formula: Parking Credit = (Sa x P), where Sa = the area of the applicant's
parcel divided by the area of the contiguous zoning district or TND, and P = the total parking that is
available on-street and in public lots in the district or TND.
C. Reduction of Parking Requirements by Provision of Transportation Demand Management.
Transportation demand management is an approach to reduce the number of work-related car trips
(and parking requirements) by incentivizing the use of bicycles, carpools, or shuttles. The Responsible
Official may authorize up to a five percent reduction in the number of required off- street parking
spaces for development that provides transportation demand management programs. Examples of
accommodations that would qualify for the credit include:
1. Enclosed bicycle lockers, employee shower facilities, lockers, and dressing areas; or
2. Meaningful financial incentives for employees to carpool or bicycle to work, provided that the
effectiveness of the program is reported annually to the Responsible Official; or
3. Shuttle service for employees.
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 188
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
Sec. 9.204 Mixed Uses and Shared Parking
A. Generally. The City Council recognizes that uses may have different hours of operation and peak
parking demand hours. The City desires to encourage the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce
paved areas and / or enhance the efficiency of land use. Where a mix of uses creates synergy with
respect to the use of parking spaces due to differences in when the spaces are most likely to be used,
the City may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this Section.
B. Shared Parking Table. Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking
spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak use of
parking areas at the same time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed
below, the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following
procedures:
1. Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for
use by specified individuals or classes of individuals (e.g., spaces that are either posted
"reserved," or secured behind a gate), by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 9.204,
Shared Parking Table, for each of the designated time periods.
2. Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods (columns). The minimum parking
requirement is the highest of these sums. Figure 9.204, Illustrative Shared Parking Credit
Calculation, provides an example of how to use Table 9.204, Shared Parking Table to calculate
required parking.

EXAMPLE: A mixed-use building in a standard development (not in a TND) has 50 2-bedroom residences, 50,000 square feet of general
office space, and 50,000 square feet of retail space. Separately, these uses would require 450 parking spaces ((50 sp. x 2 sp. / unit) +
(50,000 sf. x (3 sp. / 1,000 sf.)) + (50,000 sf. x (1 sp. / 250 sf.)) = 450). However, combined, they could share 350 parking spaces.

The largest number,
350, is the number
of parking spaces
that are required.
This example is a
22% reduction
compared to
individual
calculations.
3. In general, the maximum reduction allowed by Table 9.204, Shared Parking Table, shall be 25
percent. However, a greater reduction is permitted, provided that:
a. Sufficient land is set aside for each parking space in excess of the 25 percent reduction that
is not constructed, so that the spaces may be constructed at a later date should the City
Council determine that they are necessary; and
b. The property owner executes and records a document that guarantees that the spaces will
be constructed upon written order of the Mayor.
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 190
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
C. Special Shared Parking Study.
1. In the alternative to the methodology in Table 9.204, Shared Parking Table, an applicant may
submit a special study to demonstrate that the parking required to serve mixed uses is less
than the total of the parking requirements for each individual use. The special study shall be
undertaken by a qualified traffic engineer, and shall:
a. Review peak parking demand periods for the proposed uses during a 24-hour weekday and
each weekend day, and shall propose a required number of parking spaces based on the
combined peak hour demand for parking.
b. Provide data on the following:
i. The sensitivity of the proposed uses to change. For example, a center with no
restaurant could have significant changes in parking if a restaurant was added.
ii. Similar mixes of uses in other areas of the community.
iii. Degree of variability of parking for individual uses (average, range, and standard
deviation).
2. The City may require a reserved open area if it believes that the risk of parking needs changing
over time so warrants. Once the project is occupied and well established, if there is a surplus of
parking, the applicant may petition for additional development capacity and parking using the
reserved area.
D. Shared Parking Among Lots Under Different Ownership. When a shared parking reduction is to be
applied to uses on several lots under different ownership, the following shall be provided:
1. A plan that provides for interconnected lots;
2. Recorded easements that provide, at a minimum, for:
a. Cross-access among the parking areas and connections to permit parking by the different
uses anywhere in the connected properties;
b. Allocation of maintenance responsibilities;
c. A pedestrian circulation system that connects uses and parking areas, making it easy and
convenient to move between uses; and
d. A right of enforcement by the City.
Sec. 9.205 Bicycle Parking
A. Applicability. Bicycle parking shall be required pursuant to this Section for all parcels proposed for
development that have parking lots with 20 or more parking spaces.
B. Number of Bicycle Parking Spaces.
1. Surface parking lots: One bicycle parking space per 10 parking spaces, to a maximum of ten
bicycle parking spaces
2. Structured parking lots:
a. Minimum number of bicycle parking spaces: six
b. Structures with more than 120 parking spaces shall provide one bicycle parking space per
20 parking spaces,
c. Maximum requirement (additional spaces are optional): 10
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 191
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
C. Bicycle Parking Design Standards. Bicycle parking shall be designed so that:
1. The bicycle frame and one wheel can be locked to the rack with a high security, U-shaped lock
if both wheels are left on the bicycle. See Figure 9.205, Permitted Bicycle Parking Examples.
2. A bicycle that is six feet long can be securely held with its frame supported so that the bicycle
cannot be pushed or fall in a manner that will damage the wheel components.

extends into right-of-way or interferes with parking access while it is loading or unloading.
F. Fire Exit or Emergency Access. Off-street loading facilities shall be designed so as not to interfere
with any fire exits or emergency access facilities to either a building or site.
Sec. 9.304 Vehicle Stacking Requirements
A. Generally. Stacking spaces are used to measure the capacity of a drive-through lane to hold cars while
transactions are taking place at drive-through stations. Stacking spaces measure eight feet wide by
20 feet long and provide direct access to a service window. The position in front of a drive- through
station (i.e., a service window, ATM, or station at a drive-through bank) is counted as a stacking space.
B. Requirements. Uses that include drive-through service shall not less than the following numbers of
stacking spaces:
1. Financial institutions, convenience stores, or pharmacies: Four stacking spaces per drivethrough
station.
2. Drive through restaurants:

Sec. 9.306 Surfacing and Maintenance of Off-Street Parking Areas
A. Surfacing. Off-street parking areas shall be surfaced as follows:
1. Off-street parking areas that are required to have more than three parking spaces shall be graded
and hard surfaced with a material approved by the Department of Public Works and the City
Engineer that will protect against potholes, erosion, and dust, including hard surfaced permeable
paving materials.
2. An applicant may request use of a less durable surface (such as grass pavers, crushed stone, or
gravel) for off-street parking facilities through a conditional use application. The following review
standards shall apply to any such request:
a. The requested parking area serves low-turnover uses or overflow parking needs;
b. The perimeter of such parking areas is defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other
similar devices;
c. Surfaces with loose materials are set back at least 25 feet from a public street; and
d. The material does not generate inordinate amounts of dust.
B. Maintenance. Off-street parking surfaces shall be kept in good condition and parking space lines or
markings on hard-surfaced lots shall be kept clearly visible and distinct.
Division 9.400 Access Management and Circulation
Sec. 9.401 Access to Single Family and Duplex Lots
A. Existing Lots. Existing access to single family detached and duplex lots from arterial or collector
streets is permitted. However, the existing access shall be moved from the arterial or collector to a
local street if:
1. The lot has access a local street; and
2. The principal building is redeveloped (or a new principal building is constructed)
B. New Lots. New single family detached and duplex lots shall not take access to arterial or collector
streets unless they have more than 200 feet of frontage and the driveway is designed to prevent
vehicles from backing out onto the arterial or collector.
Sec. 9.402 Minimum Arterial Frontage
A. General. In general, the minimum arterial frontage that is required of lots that take direct access from
an arterial shall not be less that that shown in Table 9.402, Minimum Arterial Lot Frontage. No new
lots shall be created that have less frontage than set out in Table 9.402, Minimum Arterial Lot
Frontage, unless the subdivider provides for common access and cross-access easements as set out
in Subsection C.

B. Increased Frontage Requirement. The City may require a greater lot frontage for:
1. Development with driveways that are greater than 25 feet in width (not including curb returns);
or
2. Development that requires more than one access connection to the arterial.
C. Decreased Frontage Requirement. The City may allow a decreased lot frontage for individual lots
with common access easements and shared access driveways, provided that:
1. The parcel proposed for development, before subdivision, complies with this Section;
2. The standards of Section 9.403, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance, are met; and
3. Legal instruments are recorded as provided in Section 9.405, Common Access and Internal
Cross Access.
Sec. 9.403 Access Spacing and Corner Clearance
A. Generally. Access points include streets, alleys, driveways, and service roads. Spacing of access points
shall be provided as set out in this Section.
B. Measurements. Generally, the requirements of this Section are measured along the edge of the travel
way, from the closest edge of pavement of the first access connection to the closest edge of pavement
of the second access connection, including curb returns. However, access spacing on opposite sides
of the street is measured at the centerlines of the access points. The measurements are illustrated in
Figure 9.403, Illustrative Access Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements.
Figure 9.403
Illustrative Access Spacing and Corner Clearance Measurements
C. Local Streets and Collectors. There shall be a minimum spacing between the near edges of adjacent
access points to local streets and collectors as set out in Table 9.403A, Access Spacing, Local Streets
and Collectors.

E. Access Spacing, Opposite Sides of Street. In order to prevent conflicting left-turn movements,
connections on opposite sides of the street shall be directly opposite each other or offset by a
distance of at least 100 feet from centerline to centerline of the access points, unless a median
prevents the potential conflicts.
F. Corner Clearance.
1. For all uses located on corner lots, there shall be a minimum clearance between the near edge
of the nearest access point and the property corner at street intersections. No access point shall
interfere with fire hydrants, storm inlets, or other curb frontage improvements. The minimum

TABLE NOTES:
1 Applies to multifamily driveways only. See Section 9.401, Access to Single-Family and Duplex Lots for other housing types. 2
A variance is required for corner lots with arterial street frontage where the required corner clearance cannot be met as a result of its lot
width or depth.
2. If the dimensions of an existing lot and the absence of a reasonable opportunity for shared access
make compliance with Subsection F.1. impractical, then right-in, right-out access may be
permitted at the farthest available point away from the intersection. For example, a light
automobile service use (e.g., a gas station) that cannot establish shared access with neighboring
properties may be permitted to have two right-in, right-out access points (one on each frontage),
provided that they are located as far away from the intersection as possible.
3. Where ownership allows, and the geometry of the street intersection warrants, the minimum
corner clearance shall be greater than shown in Table 9.403C, Minimum Corner Clearance.
Sec. 9.404 Access Dimensions
A. General. The dimensions of access points are based on the peak hour trip generation volume of the
uses to which access is to be provided. Peak hour trips may be allocated to one or more proposed
access points. A qualified engineer shall provide the calculations for peak hour trip generation and
assignment to proposed access points. However, the low impact uses described in subsections B. and
C. are not required to provide calculations by an engineer with respect to trip generation and
assignment.
B. Single-Family, Twin Home, and Duplex Lots. Each lot that contains a single-family, twin home, or
duplex shall have no more than two driveway connections along any street frontage. Driveway width
shall not exceed the width set out in Table 9.404A, Maximum Width of Access.
Table 9.404A

C. Low Volume Presumption. The following uses are presumed to required only a single low volume
access point, as described in Table 9.404B, Access Standards, General, or, if located within the Urban
Center district, Table 9.404C, Access Standards, Urban Center. Uses that are presumed to be of low
impact pursuant to this subsection shall not require additional analysis for so long as the conditions
of this subsection are met:
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 202

E. Measurement of Reservoir. Generally, the reservoir indicated in Tables 9.404B, Access Standards,
General; and 9.404C, Access Standards, Urban Center District, is measured from the property line to
the edge of the first parking space or aisle. However, the reservoir may be measured from the edge
of pavement of the adjacent street if it is demonstrated that:
1. Measurement from the edge of pavement allows for an improved site design; and
2. It is not anticipated that the adjacent street will be widened for at least 25 years.
F. Peak Hour Volume in Excess of 500 Trips. If the peak hour volume of an individual access point
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 203
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
exceeds 500 trips, the access point shall be designed as a street intersection. Further access to lots or
parking areas shall be evaluated according to the standards of this Division (e.g., the corner clearance
standard will apply to the distance from the intersection to the first internal access connection, and
the reservoir standard will apply to the distance between the connection and the first parking space).
G. Alternative Design. The City Engineer may require that access points be configured as right turn in,
right turn out when the provision of left turn access would result in significant disruption of traffic
flow on the public street.
Sec. 9.405 Common Access and Internal Cross Access
A. Separate Ownership; No Common Plan of Development. Where adjacent properties are separately
owned and not part of a common plan of development, the City may require common access or
internal cross access as the parcels are developed, substantially improved, or redeveloped. As such,
an applicant may be granted temporary individual access if:
1. The applicant demonstrates that a reasonable offer with regard to cross-access was refused by
the adjacent landowner; and
2. The applicant records a covenant acceptable to the City to ensure that the connection will be
provided and access will be consolidated upon the earlier of:
a. Approval for development, substantial improvement, or redevelopment, of the adjacent
property, if providing such connection is a requirement of the approval for the adjacent
property; or
b. The applicant's parcel and the adjacent parcel coming under common ownership; and
3. The applicant demonstrates that the proposed temporary access will not materially affect the
safe and efficient flow of traffic.
B. Common Ownership or Common Plan of Development. Phased development, development sites
under the same ownership, or development sites that are consolidated for the purposes of
development and comprised of more than one building are considered unified parcels. Unified parcels
shall provide access as follows:
1. The number of connections permitted shall be the minimum number necessary to provide
reasonable access to the overall site and not the maximum available for the site's frontage; and
2. Access to outparcels shall be internalized using the shared circulation system and designed to
avoid excessive movement across parking aisles or queuing across surrounding parking and
driving aisles.
C. Terms. The City may require that common and cross access easements include one or more of the
following:
1. Sufficient width to accommodate a two-way access between properties, designed to
accommodate automobiles and service and loading vehicles.
2. Stub-outs and other design features to allow abutting properties to be tied in to provide future
cross access.
3. Linkage to other cross access drives in the area.
D. Location of Cross-Access. The location of the connections shall be set by the City in accordance with
the following:
1. Shallow sites (less than 200 feet deep) with buildings positioned at or near the front setback
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 204
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
line shall provide access along the rear property lines.
2. Shallow sites (less than 200 feet deep) with buildings positioned at or near the rear setback line
shall provide connections aligned with their edges along the sidewalk in front of the buildings.
3. Deep sites (200 or more feet deep) with outparcels shall provide cross-access points as follows:
a. To all outparcels, in order to connect them to the parking and circulation areas of the
principal parcel;
b. On side lot or parcel lines of the principal lot or parcel, behind any outparcels that are located
within 60 feet of said side lot or parcel lines, in order to permit movement through the area;
and
c. On side lot or parcel lines of the principal lot or parcel, aligned with edges along the sidewalk
in front of the buildings.
E. Dimensions of Cross-Access. Cross access easements shall include at least 24-feet of pavement width.
F. Approval and Recording of Easements.
1. Access that is shared by adjacent properties, whether under single or separate ownership,
requires that an appropriate legal instrument to ensure continued shared access be approved by
the City and recorded in the official public record at the applicant's expense. The recorded book
and page number shall be referenced on any subsequent subdivision plats of the property.
2. If there is an existing shared access for which there is no recorded legal documentation, such
documentation shall be executed and recorded as provided in subsection D.1.
Sec. 9.406 Number of Access Points
A. General.
1. Generally, the maximum number of access points allowed will be the smallest number of access
points that are necessary to accommodate the peak hour demands of the site. For example, if a
use in the Commercial, General (CG) district generates 300 peak hour trips, then it would be
served by one high volume access point, not six low volume access points
2. The maximum number of access points may be increased if:
a. The lot fronts on an arterial and one or more side streets of lesser functional classification;
b. Access to the site will be provided from the streets of lesser functional classification; and
c. The total number of access points along the arterial frontage is reduced.
B. Limitation. Nothing in this Section supersedes the other access management requirements of this
Division.
Sec. 9.407 Timing and Degree of Compliance
A. Generally. Access to streets shall be provided in accordance with this Section.
B. Compliance with this Division.
1. The City Council recognizes that many properties along arterials may not be in compliance with
the requirements of this Division as of the effective date of this UDC, and there are many
different contexts in which compliance with the standards of this Division are more or less
feasible. Table 9.407, Compliance with Access Management Regulations, sets out five generalized
situations, the access management objective with respect to the particular situation, and the
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 205
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
alternative methods available to the applicant for complying with the requirements of this
Division.
2. Even if the requirements of Table 9.407, Compliance with Access Management Regulations, does
not achieve strict compliance with Section 9.403, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance, the
requirements shall be utilized if they result in wider spacing between access points than would
be provided in the absence of the requirements.
Table 9.407
Compliance with Access Management Regulations
Situation Objective Method of Compliance
Existing lot proposed for
development does not meet
arterial frontage requirements of
Section 9.402, Minimum Arterial
Frontage, but has access to a
local side street.
Shift access to side streets
Lots that abut intersections of arterial streets and local streets shall
take access from the local street if the access meets the corner
clearance requirements of Section 9.403, Access Management and
Corner Clearance.
Existing lot proposed for
development abuts lots that are
built, have individual access
connections, and do not comply
with spacing requirements.
Allow reasonable access for
existing lots, but consolidate
access at first available
opportunity.
Existing access may be maintained, but if thresholds of Subsection C.
are met, then compliance with Section 9.405A is required. If there is
no existing access, then temporary access may be created upon
demonstration of compliance with Section 9.405A.
Existing lot proposed for
development does not conform
to Section 9.402, Minimum
Arterial Frontage and at least
one abutting lot under separate
ownership is not developed.
Allow reasonable access for
existing lot, and ensure that
future development will have
shared or cross access as
necessary to ensure compliance
with this Division.
Provide access in compliance with the access spacing and corner
clearance standards of Section 9.403, Access Spacing and Corner
Clearance and provide for future common access as will ensure
implementation of such standards as provided in Section 9.405,
Common Access and Internal Cross Access.
Existing lot proposed for
development abuts another lot
that is under common ownership
with the lot proposed for
development.
Ensure that development of
commonly owned property does
not frustrate City's access
management objectives.
Lots shall be consolidated, if necessary, to meet the minimum
frontage required by Section 9.402, Minimum Arterial Frontage and
meet the access spacing and corner clearance standards of Section
9.403, Access Spacing and Corner Clearance; or applicant provides
for common access (Section 9.405) and the common access meets
the requirements of Section 9.403, Access Spacing and Corner
Clearance to the maximum extent possible.
Lot proposed for development
abuts another lot which has
recorded a covenant pursuant to
Section 9.405, Common Access
and Internal Cross Access.
Ensure that recorded common
access and cross access
covenants are carried out.
Common access or internal cross access is provided as set out in the
recorded document. If the common access point would prevent an
adjacent undeveloped lot from complying with this Division, then a
covenant to provide common or cross access shall be provided as set
out in Section 9.405, Common Access and Internal Cross Access.
C. Timing of Compliance with this Division.
1. New development and subdivision shall demonstrate compliance with this Division for each
required development approval.
2. Properties with access connections that do not meet the requirements of this Division shall be
brought into compliance to the greatest extent possible when modifications to the roadway are
made or when a change in use results in one or more of the following conditions:
a. A connection permit is required.
b. Site review or platting is required.
c. The site experiences an increase of 20 percent or greater in peak hour trips or 100 vehicles
per hour in the peak hour, whichever is less, as determined by one of the following methods:
i. An estimation based on the Institute of Traffic Engineers ("ITE") Trip Generation
manual (latest edition) methodology for typical land uses, or
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 206
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
ii. Traffic counts made at similar traffic generators located in the City, or
iii. Actual traffic monitoring conducted during the peak hour of the adjacent roadway
traffic for the property.
3. If the principal activity on a parcel with access connections that do not meet the regulations of
this Division is discontinued for a period of one year or more, then upon establishment of any
use, the parcel must comply with all applicable access requirements of this Division to the
greatest extent possible.
Sec. 9.408 Modification of Access Management Requirements
A. Reduction of Spacing Requirements. The spacing requirements of Section 9.403, Access Spacing
and Corner Clearance, may be reduced in any of the following circumstances:
1. Spacing may be based on an assessment of the individual safety and operational considerations
of the proposed connection if:
a. Current average daily trip ("ADT") volume on the segment of the arterial upon which the
proposed development fronts is below 2,000; and
b. It is demonstrated that there is little, if any, potential for development within 25 years that
would raise the ADT to more than 2,000.
2. Where adequate access connection spacing cannot be achieved (for example, if the depth of an
existing block is less than the distance required between intersections)., the City may permit
lesser spacing when shared access is established with an abutting property. A shared access
agreement shall be executed and recorded as provided in Section 9.405, Common Access and
Internal Cross Access.
3. Where no other alternatives exist, construction of an access connection may be allowed along
the property line farthest from the intersection or closest access. To provide reasonable access
under these conditions, but also provide the safest operation, consideration should be given to
designing the driveway connection to allow only the right-in turning movement or only the rightin/
right out turning movements if feasible. In such a case, the applicant shall demonstrate that:
a. The inability to meet the access spacing requirements was not due to the owner subdividing
the property after the effective date of this UDC without providing internal access;
b. A reasonable offer with regard to cross-access was refused by the adjacent landowner; and
c. A covenant acceptable to the City to ensure that the connection will be provided and access
will be consolidated upon the earlier of:
i. Approval for development, substantial improvement, or redevelopment, of the
adjacent property, if providing such connection is a requirement of the approval; or
ii. The applicant's parcel and the adjacent parcel coming under common ownership; and
d. Failure to comply with the access spacing requirements will not materially affect the safe
and efficient flow of traffic.
4. If natural resource (e.g.. wetland or floodway) protection requires an alternative access.
B. Increase of Spacing Requirements. The City may require greater access spacing if the use will
generate significant truck traffic.
C. Waiver of Street Intersection Spacing. The spacing of street intersections may be reduced if:
ARTICLE 9 PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS, AND LIGHTING PAGE 207
Update: Ord 2019-16, Effective: 10/24/2019
1. There is no alternative that would bring one or more roads to connection points opposite a local
road on the opposite side of the street and avoid the staggered intersection;
2. The City Engineer determines that the location is not a safety hazard; and
3. The applicant makes intersection improvements, including bi-pass lanes or deceleration lanes (as
recommended by the City Engineer), which would not otherwise be required if the intersection
was spaced according to this Division.

v. 7.13.2010
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
Division 10.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 10.101 Purpose of Article
The purpose of this Article is to provide the detailed landscaping standards for all development,
including landscaping for street trees, buildings, residential lots, open spaces, parking lots, and
bufferyards. It also contains standards for installing and maintaining landscaping materials. The
standards are intended to protect and preserve the appearance and character of the community, to
promote the health and quality of life of the residents of the City through the protection of specified
trees located on property within the City. In particular, landscaping and tree protection protects the
area's natural heritage, conserves water, moderates the heat island effect, and reduces runoff. In
bufferyards, landscaping mitigates conflicts between uses and minimizes the effects on the surrounding
environment due to noise, dust, debris, artificial light intrusions, and other impacts of an adjoining or
nearby use.
Sec. 10.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. This Article requires two general types of landscaping: development landscaping, which
is the subject of Division 10.200, Development Landscaping; and bufferyards, which are the subject
of Division 10.300, Bufferyards, as follows:
1. Development Landscaping. Development landscaping is the landscaping that is required
regardless of the location of the proposed development with respect to other development.
There are four types of development landscaping: lot and building landscaping; open space
landscaping; parking lot landscaping; and street trees. No area of development landscaping
shall be used to calculate more than one type of landscaping requirement (e.g., a parking lot
corner is an area of parking lot landscaping, is not counted for the purposes of open space or
lot and building landscaping).
2. Bufferyard Landscaping. Bufferyards are contextual. That is, they are required based on the
zoning, development type, or right-of-way type that abuts proposed development. Bufferyards
may be required along district boundaries, along street and railroad rights-of-way, and along
the boundaries of parking lots. Generally, bufferyards must be provided as required by Division
10.300, Bufferyards. However, other sections of this UDC may require additional buffering (e.g.,
limited or conditional use standards in Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use Standards).
B. Applicability of Standards. Except as provided in subsection C., the standards of this Article apply to
all new development, redevelopment, or substantial improvements to existing sites or buildings.
C. Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the standards of this Article:
1. Individual lots of record that are used for existing single-family or two-family dwellings unless a
specific requirement is set out in this UDC (e.g., in Section 2.402, Alternative Setback Standards
for Neighborhood Conservation District.
2. Modifications to nonresidential buildings where the redevelopment does not expand the use
by more than ten percent or 3,000 square feet, whichever is less.
PAGE 214 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
3. Development that was approved in East Baton Rouge Parish prior to the effective date of this
UDC shall comply with the terms of the development approval (and not this Article) to the
extent that alternative landscaping requirements are already specified. Such approved
development shall not be required to install bufferyards if there is insufficient land area
identified on the approved plans to accommodate them.
D. Landscaping Requirements. Landscaping may be required in any of the following areas pursuant to
this Article:
1. Around the perimeter of the parcel proposed for development (bufferyards);
2. Along streets within and surrounding the parcel proposed for development (street trees);
3. In the yards of individually-owned lots within a parcel proposed for development (e.g., single
family lots);
4. In nonresidential development, around the foundation of nonresidential buildings (e.g.,
shopping centers or individual commercial buildings);
5. In commonly owned or dedicated open spaces; and
6. In and around parking lots.
E. Calculations. No area of a parcel proposed for development shall be counted more than once for
the purposes of applying landscaping requirements.
Division 10.200 Development Landscaping
Sec. 10.201 Lot and Building Landscaping
A. General.
1. Lot landscaping (subsection B) is required on lots within new residential subdivisions. This
Section does not apply to existing single-family lots.
2. Building landscaping or hardscaping (subsection C) is required around nonresidential, mixeduse,
and multifamily buildings, except:
a. In the UC district; and
b. In the center subdistrict of traditional neighborhood developments.
3. Required bufferyards, parking lots, designated open space tracts, and parkways used for street
tree planting are not counted as areas where lot or building landscaping is required.
B. Lot Landscaping.
1. Generally. Lot landscaping is required as described in Table 10.201A, Lot Planting
Requirements.
2. Substitution of Understory Trees for Canopy Trees. Understory trees may be substituted
for canopy trees if the dimensions of the lot are such that the canopy trees would not have
room to grow to a full canopy without conflicting with buildings or each other. For the purposes
of this substitution, one canopy tree equals two understory trees.

3. Ground Covers and Sod. Areas of residential lots that are not covered by buildings, driveways,
swimming pools, or other hard surfaces shall be sodded or planted with permitted ground
covers as set out in Appendix B, Plant Lists. unless they are covered by woodlands, crops, or
feedstock.
D. Building Landscaping or Hardscaping.
3. Generally. Multifamily and nonresidential buildings shall be surrounded by planting areas and /
or sidewalks with a minimum width as set out in Table 10.201B, Building Landscaping
Requirements. Planting areas count towards the landscape surface ratio. Sidewalks do not.
4. Awnings and Roof Overhangs. Awnings and roof overhangs may extend into building
landscaping or hardscaping areas.
5. Location. The planting areas and / or sidewalks are not required in areas that are designed for
direct vehicular access to the building, such as loading bays, service bays, and drive-through
lanes on the side of the building with the service window, but shall be installed between
parking spaces and the building. See Figure 10.201, Illustrative Building Landscaping and
Hardscaping.
Figure 10.201
Illustrative Building Landscaping and Hardscaping
4. Required Planting.
a. Planting areas around buildings shall be landscaped with shrubs, planted at intervals of not
more than five feet. In the alternative, such plantings may be clustered, if equal or greater
numbers of plants are used.
PAGE 216 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
b. Trees may be substituted for shrubs, perennials, or ornamental grasses in areas where
there is sufficient room for the healthy growth and stability of the tree. Substitution of
trees for shrubs, perennials, or ornamental grasses shall be at a rate of one understory or
evergreen tree equals four shrubs, perennials, or ornamental grasses.
c. Ground surfaces shall be mulched, sodded, or planted with a permitted ground cover.

TABLE NOTE:
1 Where planting areas are required, they may be crossed with sidewalks to provide access to the building.
Sec. 10.202 Open Space Landscaping
A. Generally. Open space landscaping is that landscaping which is installed on designated open space
tracts (i.e., areas that are set aside pursuant to the required open space ratio, or otherwise
designated as commonly owned open space even if not required by this UDC).
B. Exceptions.
1. General Exceptions. The area to which open space landscaping requirements applies does not
include any open spaces that are in the following categories:
a. Areas that are not dedicated as open space tracts or under common ownership by a
property owners' association.
b. Areas within required bufferyards, even if commonly owned (bufferyards are regulated by
Division 10.300, Bufferyard Requirements).
c. Areas within and within 15 feet of ball fields, playing courts, and similar play areas
(including bleachers or seating areas for spectators), which are designed to be free of trees
and landscaping. However, where the perimeter of such an active recreation area is within
30 feet of one or more residential lots, the perimeter shall be planted with a Type C
Bufferyard. See Division 10.300, Bufferyard Requirements.
d. Parking areas for recreation facilities in the open space (parking lot landscaping is
regulated by Section 10.203, Parking Lot Landscaping).
e. Waterbodies and wet detention basins.
f. Wooded areas that are designated as open space tracts. For the purposes of identification,
the boundaries of the wooded areas follows the canopy line.
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 217
v. 7.13.2010
2. Limited Exceptions. The area within wetlands that are dedicated as open space does not have
to be landscaped. However, invasive exotic species (if present) shall be removed and replaced
with native wetland species unless the City finds that the cost of removal and replacement is
unreasonably excessive in relation to the cost of the proposed development. Landscaping
installed near wetlands shall be composed of species that are tolerant of a high water table.
C. Planting Requirements.
1. Generally. Open space landscaping is required as described in Table 10.202, Open Space
Landscaping Standards.
2. Substitution of Canopy Trees for Evergreens and Understory Trees. Canopy trees may be
substituted for understory trees or evergreen trees if the dimensions of the open space tract
are such that the canopy trees would not have room to grow to a full canopy without
conflicting with buildings or each other. For the purposes of this substitution, one canopy tree
equals two understory trees or 1.5 evergreen trees.
Table 10.202
Open Space Planting Requirements
District Minimum Number of Canopy Trees Per Acre
4
5
3. Ground Cover. Open space areas shall be planted with ground covers to prevent erosion and
windblown dust. Mulch may be used in areas under the canopy of trees and in beds in which
shrubs are planted.
E. Distribution. Open space landscaping should be distributed around the area of open space to serve
the following priorities, in order:
3. To give trees adequate room for healthy growth and stability.
4. To enhance the landscaping's contribution to the ecological or buffering function of the open
space tract (e.g., to prevent erosion, to buffer streams, or to buffer land uses from each other).
5. To contribute to the aesthetics of the parcel proposed for development and adjacent streets.
Sec. 10.203 Parking Lot Landscaping
A. Generally. Parking lot landscaping is required within and around parking lots that contain more
than five parking spaces.
B. Exemptions. Farmsteads, single-family dwellings, and two-family dwellings are not required to
provide parking lot landscaping.
C. Parking Lot Landscape Areas. Landscaping is required in all of the following areas:
1. At the ends of parking aisles, planted in endcap islands that are not less than 10 feet wide and
40 feet long, with 10 foot curb radii on the side that faces outward from the parking aisle.
PAGE 218 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
2. In the middle of parking rows, planted in interior islands that are not less than 10 feet wide and
40 feet long, with 5 foot curb radii at both ends, at intervals required by subsection C., below.
3. At the corners of parking lots, planted in corner islands, which are the area defined by the
extension of the edges of intersecting parking modules. See Figure 10.203A, Illustrative Parking
Lot Landscape Areas.
Figure 10.203A
Illustrative Parking Lot Landscape Areas
D. Required Landscaping. Parking lot landscape islands shall be provided at the maximum intervals
described in Table 10.203, Maximum Interval Between Landscape Islands (see Figure 10.203A,
Illustrative Parking Lot Landscape Areas, for illustration of maximum interval), and planted as
follows:
1. Each interior and endcap island shall be planted with a minimum of:
a. One canopy tree or two understory trees; and
b. Ground cover, which may be either:
i. Sod; or
ii. Shrubs, ornamental grasses, or perennials that are planted at intervals of not less than
3 feet in a bed of mulch.
2. Each parking lot corner shall be planted with two canopy trees or three understory trees,
unless such plantings would interfere with sight distances that are required for safe ingress to

ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 219
v. 7.13.2010
E. Alternative Maximum Interval. The maximum interval may be modified as follows:
1. The maximum interval may be increased up to 75 percent to accommodate landscape islands
that preserve existing trees in place, provided that:
a. The trees are healthy, non-invasive, and at least five years old; and
b. The landscape island is large enough to maintain the health of the tree.
2. The maximum interval may be waived where parking modules are separated by a landscape
strip, provided that at least five feet of the width of the strip is landscaped (other areas may be
curb or sidewalk) with trees that are appropriate for street tree use, planted at intervals of not
less than 50 feet on center. Endcap islands that are divided by landscape strips shall be planted
with two canopy trees or four understory trees. See Figure 10.203B, Illustrative Landscape Strip
Between Modules.
Figure 10.203B
Illustrative Landscape Strip Between Modules
F. Use of Islands for Stormwater Treatment. Wherever possible, landscape islands shall be designed
to incorporate storm water runoff best management practices ("BMPs"), by incorporating
vegetated swales, bio-infiltration, and other types of water quality measures. These areas may have
to exceed the minimum areas required by subsection C., above, in order to meet engineering
requirements.
Sec. 10.204 Street Trees
A. Generally. Street trees are trees that are planted within the street right-of-way, either in parkways,
tree grates in sidewalks, or medians. Street trees are required:
1. In the UC district, along new rights-of-way (if created), and along existing rights-of-way in front
of redeveloped properties where there is at least 5 feet of parkway or sidewalk width within
which street trees could be planted, while still providing for at least five feet of clear sidewalk
(however, street trees are not required along State highways if the state does not permit
them);
2. Along both sides of all new streets in the center and general subdistricts of traditional
neighborhood developments; and
3. Along both sides of new streets in Urban Residential, Business Park and Industrial districts.

v. 7.13.2010
Figure 10.204
Street Trees
Street trees are shown in color
B. Types and Species of Street Trees. To maintain a consistent appearance along individual street
segments:
1. All street trees shall be canopy trees that are suitable for installation in the space within the
parkway or within a tree grate, as applicable, unless the understory trees are approved for
specific effect in limited area pursuant to subsection B.2., below.
2. Understory trees may be approved in parkways, provided that:
a. 1.6 understory trees are provided for each canopy tree that would otherwise required, and
spacing between trees is proportionately reduced; and
b. The understory trees are used in areas where buildings are close to the parkway, such that
the installation of canopy trees would create a likely conflict between the street trees and
the nearby buildings.
3. The trees planted in a landscaped median shall be of a different species from those planted in
the parkways. If the parkways are planted with canopy trees, then medians may be planted
with understory trees instead of canopy trees.
C. Location. No street trees other than understory trees are planted under or within five lateral feet of
any underground water line, sewer line, transmission line or other utility. The City may further limit
the species of understory trees that are allowed in these locations to minimize interference with
utilities.
D. Spacing.
1. Minimum Spacing. No trees may be planted closer than 25 feet together, except that special
plantings may be clustered if the cluster does not negatively affect the continuing health of the
clustered trees, and the cluster is approved in the landscape plan of the plat or land
development.
2. Maximum Spacing. Street trees shall be spaced not more than 60 feet on center for trees with
large canopies (e.g., live oaks), or 40 feet on center for trees with smaller canopies. If the
parkway or median is more than 16 feet in width and does not contain open ditch drainage,
then canopy trees shall be installed in two rows, with trees staggered, each row spaced not
more than 60 feet on-center.
E. Maintenance. Street Trees required by this UDC shall be maintained by a developer, lot owner,
tenant, property owners' association or other entity having a legal interest in the ownership of the
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 221
v. 7.13.2010
subdivision or lots in the subdivision. The entity that is in charge of the maintenance shall be
indicated on the landscape plan, and documentation (e.g., covenants, conditions, and restrictions)
shall be provided to the City that shows the legal obligation of the entity to perform the
maintenance.
F. Replacement. If the City or a utility provider must remove trees to access utilities for repair or
maintenance, then the developer or property owners association shall pay the cost of removal and
shall replace the trees within 30 days of the completion of the work unless the City Engineer
determines that replacement would put utilities at material risk.
Division 10.300 Bufferyards
Sec. 10.301 Bufferyard Classifications and Bufferyard Model
A. Generally. Bufferyards are classified from less opaque (Class A) to more opaque (Class E). The
width and composition of bufferyards shall be as set out in Table 10.301, Bufferyard Classifications.
Table 10.301
Bufferyard Classifications
Type % Opacity Width
Required Plantings per 100 Linear Feet
Canopy Trees Berm or Opaque Wall or Fence Evergreen Trees Understory Trees Shrubs

Type B 23% 10 ft. 2 2 2 20 -
Type C 52% 25 ft. 3 3 3 30 3 foot high berm, wall, or fence
Type D 74% 40 ft. 3 3 3 30 6 foot high berm, wall, or fence
Type E 99% 50 ft. 4 4 4 40 6 foot high berm, wall, or fence
B. Bufferyard Model. A bufferyard model is provided to provide flexibility with respect to bufferyard
width and planting requirements. The bufferyard model is on-line at
http://www.zoningplus.com/regs/zachary, by pressing the "BufferBuilder" button on the left-hand
side of the screen. The applicant may use the bufferyard model to reduce the width of required
bufferyards by specifying one or more bufferyards with the same or higher opacity than required by
this Division or other applicable standard of this UDC (opacities for bufferyard types are shown in
the second column of Table 10.301, Bufferyard Classifications), when the application of the
standards of this Article would consume a disproportionate share of the land area of the parcel
proposed for development in one or both of the following ways:
1. If the open space ratio or landscape surface ratio specified for the proposed development in
Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards, would be exceeded by more than 50
percent by the application of the standards of this Division. For example, if the requirement in
Article 2 is 20 percent open space, then, since 50% x 20% = 10%, if the application of this Article
results in more than 30 percent open space (20% required + 10% additional), then the
bufferyard model may be used.
2. If the requirements of this Division would result in an area of bufferyards that occupies more
than 20 percent of the parcel proposed for development.
PAGE 222 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
C. Minimum Width. No part of a required bufferyard shall be reduced to a width of less than three
feet.
Sec. 10.302 District Bufferyard Standards
A. Generally. Table 10.302, District Boundary Bufferyard Standards, sets out the classification of
bufferyard that is required between zoning districts that are not separated by a public street. The
table is a matrix in which all districts are shown. Rows show the zoning of the parcel proposed for
development, and columns show the zoning of the adjoining land. Two letters are shown for each
condition (for example, A and C). The bufferyard required for the proposed use is listed first. The
letter listed second is the buffer that is required on the adjoining property. A - means that no
bufferyard is required.

B. Existing Adjacent Development without Bufferyards. Where the adjoining property is already
developed and does not have the required bufferyard, the proposed development shall provide a
bufferyard of the next most opaque classification than the more opaque of the two bufferyards
required (e.g., if the requirement is C / A, and the adjoining property is already developed and does
not have a bufferyard, then the developer must install a Type D bufferyard).
C. Relationship to Other Bufferyard Requirements. Some Limited or Conditional Uses may have
different requirements for bufferyards, as specified in Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use
Standards. If bufferyards are required by another section of this UDC along property boundaries
that are also district boundaries, then the more opaque bufferyard requirement shall supersede the
less opaque one (only one bufferyard is required).
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 223
v. 7.13.2010
D. Buffering Existing Residential Development. The City may require an increase in the level of opacity
of a bufferyard (e.g., from Type A to Type B) between new residential development and existing
residential development, if:
1. The lot widths of the new development are less than 80 percent of the lot widths of the nearest
lots of the existing development;
2. The building height of the new development is more than eight feet taller than the building
height of the existing development; or
3. The housing types that are located on the lots that abut existing development are different
from the housing types of the existing development (e.g., new townhome lots abutting existing
single family detached lots).
Sec. 10.303 Existing Trees, Fences, and Walls on Developed Property
A. Generally. Existing trees, fences, and walls may be counted towards bufferyard requirements,
provided that the trees are in good health and are not invasive exotic species, and the fences or
walls are in good repair.
B. Existing Landscaping Credit. Credit shall be given for existing trees according to the standards of
Section 10.401, Tree Preservation Credit.
C. Existing Fences and Walls. If a fence or wall is required and there is already a fence or wall on the
property line, then the City may temporarily waive the fence or wall requirement, provided:
1. The responsible official verifies that the existing fence or wall is sturdy and in good condition;
2. The height, opacity, and extent of the fence or wall meets the intent of this Article with regard
to buffering;
3. The applicant records an agreement with the City that includes appropriate assurances that if
the fence or wall deteriorates, or is damaged, destroyed, or removed, the applicant will cause it
to be repaired or replaced with a fence or wall that meets the standards of this Article;
4. The applicant's final plat or, if no plat is required, development approval, includes an
annotation regarding the applicant's responsibilities under the agreement required by
subsection C.3., above.
Sec. 10.304 Street and Railroad Bufferyard Standards
A. Generally. The bufferyard standards in Table 10.304, Bufferyard Requirements for Roads and
Railroads, address the type of bufferyard that is required along arterial, collector, and local streets
or railroads (for classifications, see Table 10.301, Bufferyard Classifications).

TABLE NOTES:
1 For agricultural or forestry use only, no buffer is required. However, residential subdivisions shall follow the requirements for the Estate
Residential district.
2 Single-family cluster, conservation subdivisions, and preservation subdivisions shall provide a Type D bufferyard along arterials and a Type
C bufferyard along collectors.
3 Not required along collectors within traditional neighborhood developments.
4 Generally, no buffer is required. However, where there is unbuffered residential on the other side of the railroad right-of-way, a Type B
buffer is required.
B. Credit for Street Trees. Street trees provided according to Section 10.204, Street Trees, shall be
counted towards the buffering requirements of this Section.
C. Limited and Conditional Uses. Some limited or conditional uses may have additional bufferyard
requirements, as specified in Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use Standards.
Sec. 10.305 Parking Lot Bufferyards
A. Generally. Parking lot bufferyards are located along the perimeter of parking lots. Their purpose is
to mitigate the impact of headlights on streets and abutting residential property, and to reduce the
aesthetic impact of parked cars on the character of the street.
B. Where Required. Parking lot bufferyards are required:
1. Between parking lots and abutting residential lots, unless:
a. The area between the parking lot and the abutting lot is occupied by a building; or
b. Another type of bufferyard is required (e.g., a district boundary bufferyard or a bufferyard
required for a conditional or limited use) and the other bufferyard provides screening
between a height of zero and three feet above grade.
2. Between parking lots and streets, except in areas where:
a. The edge of the parking lot is at least 25 feet away from the edge of pavement; or
b. The elevation of the parking lot is at least three feet below the crown of the street; or
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 225
v. 7.13.2010
c. The area between the parking lot and the street is occupied by a building or access point to
the parcel proposed for development; or
d. Another type of bufferyard is provided along the street that includes buffering between a
height of zero and three feet above grade.
C. Composition. Parking lot bufferyards shall be composed of any of the following, set in a bufferyard
area that is at least three feet wide:
1. A three-foot high masonry wall, measured from the surface of the parking lot in the area that is
closest to the wall; and / or
2. Shrubs planted to form a continuous buffer that is at least three feet in height if the plants form
a hedge with comparable opacity from the ground to three feet in height, or five feet in height
if ornamental grasses are used that do not provide opacity that is comparable to a hedge at
three feet in height. If shrubs or ornamental grasses are used, the landscape area shall be set
back from parking spaces:
a. Three feet from the edge of pavement if there are no curbs or wheel stops; or
b. Three feet from the face of the curb or parking bumper that faces the parking space. See
Figure 10.305, Illustrative Composition of Parking Lot Bufferyard.

Illustrative Composition of Parking Lot Bufferyard
Division 10.400 Tree Preservation Credit and Tree Protection
Sec. 10.401 Tree Preservation Credit
A. Generally. Credit may be given for the preservation of existing trees and shrubs, as provided in this
Section.
B. Condition of Existing Landscaping. Existing landscaping is eligible for credit only if:
1. It is healthy and in good structural condition;
2. It is not on the prohibited plants list; and
3. Except with respect to street trees (which have no limitation on location except pursuant
to subsection C.2.b., below), it is located:
a. Within the area where the credit will be applied (e.g., trees preserved in a parking lot are
counted as parking lot landscaping); or
PAGE 226 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
b. Within 15 feet of such area and situated such that it will contribute to the purpose of the
landscape area to which it is credited (e.g., a tree located within 15 feet of a bufferyard
may be credited to the bufferyard if it is located between the property line and the
building or use).
C. Location of Existing Landscaping.
1. Generally. Generally, credit is only available for plants that are located on the parcel proposed
for development.
2. Street Trees.
a. Existing street trees may be credited against street tree requirements.
b. The City may also approve the preservation of existing canopy that extends over the street
as an alternative to the street tree requirement.
D. Calculation of Canopy Tree Preservation Credit. For the purposes of the planting requirements of
this Article, credit shall be given for preserved canopy trees as set out in Table 10.401, Canopy Tree
Preservation Credit.
Table 10.401
Canopy Tree Preservation Credit
Diameter at Breast Height of Preserved Canopy Tree
More Than Up to and Including Credit Per Preserved Tree
32 inches Any 5 canopy trees
24 inches 32 inches 4 canopy trees
16 inches 24 inches 3 canopy trees
8 inches 16 inches 2 canopy trees
4 inches 8 inches 1.5 canopy trees
2.5 inches 4 inches 1 canopy tree
E. Calculation of Other Landscaping Credit. Existing healthy landscaping that is not on the prohibited
plant list shall be credited against planting requirements on a one to one basis in the same category
of plant material. For example, the preservation of one existing shrub reduces the planting
requirement for the area where the shrub is located by one shrub.
Sec. 10.402 Tree Removal and Planting on Public Property
No person shall remove a tree from public property, nor plant a tree on public property, except with the
consent of the City Council, or as provided in an approved landscape plan that includes street tree
planting requirements.
Sec. 10.403 Tree Installation, Removal, and Replacement
A. Generally. The purpose of this Section is to ensure the continued implementation of approved
landscape plans and the removal and disposal of dead, diseased, or severely damaged trees on all
parcels within the City, except those used for agricultural, forestry, or natural open space purposes.
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 227
v. 7.13.2010
B. Installation Locations. Trees shall be installed in the locations indicated on an approved landscape
plan. Other trees may also be installed at the discretion of the property owner, provided that:
1. Trees that are likely to grow to a height of more than 25 feet shall not be planted within 20 feet
of overhead utility lines.
2. Trees that are likely to grow to a height of more than 40 feet shall not be planted within 50 feet
of overhead utility lines.
C. Mandatory Tree Removal. Trees shall be removed pursuant to an order of the Public Works
Director that is issued as provided in this subsection.
1. The Public Works Director may order trees to be removed from any parcel within the City,
except those used for agricultural, forestry, or natural open space purposes, if any of the
following conditions exist:
a. The trees are dead; or
b. The trees are damaged or diseased and cannot reasonably be saved; or
c. The trees are interfering with utilities and removal of the trees is the only practical option;
or
d. The trees present a safety hazard to pedestrians or motorists;
e. The trees present a safety hazard to a building; or
f. The trees are an invasive exotic species.
2. The Public Works Director may order trees to be removed from any agricultural, forestry, or
natural open space parcel, if any of the following conditions exist:
a. The trees are afflicted with a communicable disease that could spread to other trees in the
City; or
b. The trees are interfering with utilities and the Public Works Director orders their removal;
or
c. The trees present a safety hazard to pedestrians or motorists; or
d. The trees present a safety hazard to a building; or
e. The trees are an invasive exotic species; or
f. An approved landscape maintenance plan requires the removal of the trees.
D. Other Tree Removal.
1. Trees that are required or protected by a development approval shall not be removed unless
the property owner demonstrates that:
a. They are dead; or
b. They are damaged or diseased and cannot reasonably be saved; or
c. A new landscape plan is approved that allows for the removal of the trees.
PAGE 228 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
2. Lot landscaping shall be installed on single-family and duplex lots pursuant to Section 10.201,
Lot and Building Landscaping, but may be removed by a subsequent owner without approval by
the City.
E. Tree Replacement. Any tree that is required by a development approval shall be replaced with a
tree that has a comparable canopy at maturity, except that replacement is optional if:
1. A new landscape plan is approved that does not require their replacement; or
2. The tree was installed on a single-family detached or duplex lot pursuant to the lot landscaping
requirements of Section 10.201, Lot and Building Landscaping, and then removed by a
subsequent owner.
Sec. 10.404 Tree Protection and Maintenance
A. Generally. Proper pruning of trees is essential to maintaining the trees in good condition. Trees that
are installed pursuant to this Article (except trees on individually owned single family and duplex
lots), are considered "protected trees," and must be maintained pursuant to this Section. Violations
of this section shall be corrected, if possible, or the damaged tree shall be replaced.
B. Restrictions Within Drip-line or Critical Root Zone.
1. No cutting or filling, nor storage of building materials or debris, nor disposal of wastes, shall
take place within the larger of the drip-line or critical root zone of any protected tree.
2. No impervious paving shall be placed within the critical root zone of any protected tree.
C. Prohibited Pruning Techniques.
1. Generally. The following types of pruning are prohibited because they damage the tree and
may reduce its lifespan and undermine its structural integrity:
a. Topping (cutting large vertical branches of the tree to reduce its height). See Figure
10.404.A.
b. Tipping (cutting branches between nodes). See Figure 10.404.B.
c. Bark ripping (cutting branches so that the bark rips when the branch falls). See Figure
10.404.C.
d. Flush cuts (cutting the branch too close to the collar, the area where the branch connects
to the tree). See Figure 10.404.D.
e. Stub cuts (cutting branches too far away from the collar, the area where the branch
connects to the tree). See Figure 10.404.E.

Prohibited Pruning Techniques
2. Exceptions. Trees that are damaged by storms or other causes, or trees under utility wires or
other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempt from this
Section at the discretion of the Public Works Director or designee.
E. Tree Protection During Construction. All trees that are not in areas to be cleared for construction
shall be protected during construction as follows:
2. The larger of the drip-line or critical root zone of all protected trees shall be barricaded during
construction to prevent damage to the trees and their roots by construction equipment.
3. All trees near any excavation or construction of any building, structure, or street work, whether
on the parcel proposed for development, or on public property, shall be guarded with a good
substantial fence, frame, or box. The construction tree guard shall be not less than four feet
high and eight feet square, or at a distance in feet from the tree trunk equal to the diameter of
the trunk at breast height ("D.B.H.") in inches, whichever is greater. All building material, dirt,
or other debris shall be kept outside the construction tree guard.
4. No person shall change natural drainage, excavate any ditches, tunnels, trenches, or lay any
drive within a radius of 10 feet from any protected tree without first obtaining written
permission from the Public Works Director.
Division 10.500 Landscape Plan, Installation, and Maintenance
Sec. 10.501 Landscape Plan Approval
A. General.
1. Compliance with the standards of this Article shall be demonstrated by a schematic landscape
plan and a landscape installation and maintenance plan. Collectively, these documents shall be
referred to as the "landscape plan."
2. Landscape plans for nonresidential, mixed-use, and multifamily development shall be prepared
by a registered landscape architect who is licensed to practice in the State of Louisiana.
B. Contents of Schematic Landscape Plan. The schematic landscape plan shall provide:
1. Tabular information that shows, for each landscape area required by this Article:
a. The surface area available for planting;
PAGE 230 ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING
v. 7.13.2010
b. The number of canopy trees, evergreen trees, understory trees, and shrubs, perennials, or
ornamental grasses that are required in each area; and
c. The number of, and species of, canopy trees, evergreen trees, understory trees, and
shrubs, perennials, or ornamental grasses that are provided in each area (if any
conversions from one classification of plant to another are applied, the conversions shall
also be shown); and
d. Any credits that are requested for preserving existing trees or shrubs pursuant to Section
10.401, Tree Preservation Credit.
2. A plan view, drawn to scale, that shows:
a. The location and species of each plant, showing the anticipated canopy or spread of the
plant five years after installation;
b. The general layout of irrigation systems;
c. The location of existing landscaping for which credit is requested, including the diameter at
breast height measurements of canopy trees; and
d. The location of property lines; building footprints, utility easements, and power lines.
C. Landscape Installation and Maintenance Plan. A landscape installation and maintenance plan shall
identify the proposed planting techniques, the short-term landscape maintenance program, and
long-term landscape maintenance program for all landscaped areas except landscaping of private
lots (unless a property owners' association is to maintain the landscaping on private lots). The
maintenance plans shall provide a detailed explanation of the work to be done, the reason it is
needed, the frequency of the work, and the estimated annual cost of the work. This is intended to
be a guide to the property owners' association on the needed maintenance, and an aid to budgeting
and contracting. It also informs the developer of work that needs to be accomplished prior to
turning the project over to the property owners' association, and ensures continuing compliance
with the Citys landscape and open space standards.
D. Approval and Timing of Approval.
1. Plans meeting minimum standards of this Section shall be approved. However, in reviewing the
plans, adjustments in the location of plants may be required where the City finds such
alterations would better serve the purposes for which they are intended.
2. Landscape plans containing street trees and open spaces shall be submitted for approval at the
primary plat application stage.
3. Landscape plans containing site features, bufferyards and required landscaping shall be
submitted for approval at the building permit stage.
Sec. 10.502 Species and Diversity
A. Generally. Large monocultures of plant material pose the risk of large-scale losses of landscaping in
the event of species-specific disease or blight. Therefore, diversity of landscape materials is
required pursuant to this Section.
ARTICLE 10 LANDSCAPING PAGE 231
v. 7.13.2010
B. Approved and Prohibited Plant Lists.
1. Approved Plant List. A list of plants that are approved by the City for meeting the requirements
of this Article is provided in Appendix B, Plant Lists. The list may be amended by resolution of
the Planning Commission. Plants that are neither approved nor prohibited may be planted, but
do not count towards landscaping requirements unless they are added to the approved plant
list by the Planning Commission.
2. Prohibited Plant List. A list of plants that are not allowed anywhere in the City is provided in
Appendix B, Plant Lists. Prohibited plants must be removed from parcels proposed for
development prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
C. Development Landscaping and Bufferyard Landscaping Diversity. In order to avoid large
monocultures of trees and shrubs:
1. For projects that require fewer than 25 canopy trees:
a. No more than 30 percent of each category of required landscaping (canopy trees,
understory trees, evergreen trees, and shrubs) on a parcel proposed for development shall
be of any one species; and
b. No more than 40 percent of each category shall be of any one genera.
2. For projects that require 25 canopy trees or more:
a. No more than 10 percent of each category of required landscaping on a parcel proposed
for development shall be of any one species; and
b. No more than 40 percent of each category shall be of any one genera.
D. Street Tree Diversity. Street trees are counted in the calculations of subsection B., above. Trees
shall be distributed such that each street block contains at least two genera of street trees.
Sec. 10.503 Size and Quality of New Landscape Material
A. Generally. The size and quality of landscape material that is installed in accordance with the
requirements of this Article shall meet the standards of this Section.

Sec. 10.504 Timing of Installation; Inspections
A. Completion of Landscape Improvements.
1. Bufferyard and street tree landscaping must be completed prior to a subdivision plat being
recorded, or, if no plat is required, a certificate of occupancy being issued. If this requirement
would result in the installation of landscaping during an inappropriate season, then the City
may:
a. Allow the plat to be recorded upon condition that security is provided for the installation
of the required landscaping during planting season; or
b. Issue a temporary certificate of occupancy, on the condition that a permanent certificate
of occupancy will not be issued unless the required landscaping is installed.
2. All other landscaping must be installed before issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued if necessary to allow for the
planting of landscaping improvements during an appropriate season or weather condition.
B. Periodic Inspections. The City may inspect each site periodically after approval of a subdivision plat
or issuance of the certificate of occupancy to ensure compliance with the Article.
Sec. 10.505 Surety
A. Surety Required. The applicant shall submit the bid for the landscape plan for review by the City. A
bond, landscape contractor guarantee, or other acceptable surety equal to 120 percent of the cost
of implementing the landscape plan shall be provided to ensure proper installation and
maintenance of the landscaping for a period of two years from the date of installation.
B. Replacement Required. The applicant shall warrant all landscaping materials for a period of two
years after installation. All plant materials that die within two years from the date of installation
shall be replaced by the applicant. If the applicant fails to replace the plant materials, the City may
use the performance guarantee to replace dead materials. For all required landscaping on individual
residential lots, the developer shall convey a two-year warranty to the purchaser at the time of
closing.
C. Return or Release of Surety. The City shall return or release the surety after the two year period is
expired upon request of the applicant and demonstration that the landscaping that is protected by
the guarantee is established and in good condition.

Division 11.300 Traditional Neighborhood Development
Sec. 11.301 Purpose of Division; Application of TND Subdistricts
A. Generally. A traditional neighborhood development ("TND") is a mixed-use community within the
City that offers a variety of housing types at a variety of price points; prominently sited civic or
community buildings and public open spaces; and stores, offices, services, and (in larger
developments) schools, providing a balanced mix of activities in close proximity to each other. TNDs
have a recognizable center and clearly defined edges, and streets, sidewalks, and pathways are
designed so that in most locations the pedestrian and bicyclist are given at least equal status as the
automobile.
B. Mix of Uses. TNDs are mixed-use developments that are allowed to include a wider variety of uses
than are otherwise allowed in the zoning district. Nonresidential uses that are allowed in TNDs but
not in the zoning district generally are indicated in the tables of Division 1.300, Permitted, Limited,
Conditional, and Prohibited Uses.
C. Pattern Books. Pattern books are required for TNDs. See Section 14.504, Pattern Book
Requirements.
D. Establishment of Subdistricts. Plans submitted for approval pursuant to this division shall indicate
three sub-districts:
1. Center (C), which is the location for the most intense development, including vertically
mixed-use (at the applicants option), and formal public gathering spaces.
2. General (G), which is the location for most of the housing in the development.
3. Edge (E), which is the location for the least intense development, in the form of relatively
large-lot single-family detached residences.
Sec. 11.302 Traditional Neighborhood Developments in Multiple Zoning Districts
A. Generally. Development density for TNDs is established by Section 2.201, Residential Density, Open
Space, and Parcel Standards. The permitted density does not have to be evenly distributed
throughout the parcel proposed for development.
ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS PAGE 237
v. 7.13.2010
B. Multiple Zoning Districts.
1. Generally. If a TND spans multiple zoning districts, density may not be allocated from one
contiguous zoning district area to any another. However, it may be unevenly distributed within
each contiguous zoning district. See Figure 11.302, TND With Multiple Zoning Districts.
Figure 11.302
TND With Multiple Zoning Districts
2. Relationship to TND Subdistricts. Subdistricts are applied across the entire TND, regardless of
the underlying zoning district. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to require that each
zoning district contain all three TND subdistricts.
Sec. 11.303 Layout of Traditional Neighborhood Development
A. Generally. An efficient multimodal circulation system that includes streets, alleys, sidewalks, and
trails shall be provided throughout the proposed development. Generally, the density and intensity
of development shall be concentrated in the center subdistricts, and lessen as distance to the
center subdistricts increases.
B. Subdistricts. The applicant shall designate the boundaries of the subdistricts on the plan for the
TND.
C. Access to Residential Lots. Residential lots shall be accessed as provided in Table 11.303A,
Residential Access by Subdistrict.

E. Blocks. The standards of this subsection supersede standards in Article 8, Streets, Sidewalks, Trails,
and Utilities in the event of a direct conflict.
1. Arrangement. Although a strict grid is not required, blocks shall be arranged in grid-like fashion
to ensure connectivity and alternate travel routes within the development.
2. Block Length.
a. Street segments in the Center Subdistrict shall not be longer than 500 feet, unless buildings
provide pedestrian access from the front sidewalk to rear parking areas or structures at
intervals of not more than 300 feet.
b. Street segments in the General and Edge Subdistricts, shall not be longer than 650 feet,
and should generally be shorter than 650 feet. This requirement does not apply where:
i. The street segment traverses open spaces that are wider than 650 feet; or
ii. The view along the segment is interrupted by a significant curve, jog, or offset in the
street, provided that the curve, jog, or offset is situated not more than 650 feet from
the intersections that define the street segment.
3. Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs may be used only in the E sub-district, but only where necessary due
to site constraints. Cul-de-sacs may not be longer than 350 feet.
ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS PAGE 239
v. 7.13.2010
F. Streets. Streets shall be designed according to the applicable standards of Article 8, Streets,
Sidewalks, Trails, and Utilities, and as provided therein, may have different right-of-way width and
utilization than other streets in the City. Streets shall be laid out to provide connectivity within the
development, and connections to adjacent neighborhoods.
G. Alleys. Alleys shall be installed to provide service and parking access within the Center and General
subdistricts, and shall conform to the requirements of Article 8, Streets, Sidewalks, Trails, and
Utilities. In areas where alleys will be used to provide services (e.g., trash collection or utilities) in
addition to access), the City may require greater dimensions, and the Public Works Director or
designee shall approve all connections and curb radii after consultation with the Fire Department
and solid waste service provider.
H. Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all streets, except along a side which is a
park or designated open space, and shall be designed with the dimensions set out in Table 8.202B,
TND Street Configurations, and the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines.
I. Trails. Off-street trails and multi-use paths shall be installed to enhance access to and through open
space and recreational areas that are used as amenities for the TND development, and to connect
to existing or planned trail systems in the City. Trails, where used, shall be eight feet wide and
paved with concrete, compacted crushed limestone, or compacted cinder.
J. Off-Street Parking. Off-street parking shall be located behind the building it serves, or in parking
garages that are designed according to the same standards that apply in the UC zoning district,
which are set out in Section 11.604, Parking Lots and Parking Garages.
K. Open Space and Recreation Areas.
1. Open Space.
a. Generally, open spaces should be integrated into the development design to bring
significant open space to the maximum number of properties, as well as visibility from
public rights-of-way within the proposed development. Small, odd, left-over open space
areas should be avoided. Extra landscaping may be required to enhance the value of such
spaces where they cannot be avoided.
b. Open space shall be designed to provide greenways along drainage corridors and streams.
The landscaping along corridors or streams shall be designed to enhance the filtering of
surface and subsurface water flows. Trails shall provide access along the greenway for the
residents of the proposed development.
c. Formal open spaces shall be designed to provide areas of focus within the development.
Landscaping and furniture for pedestrians should be installed to enhance this effect.
d. Open spaces shall be protected by appropriate easements and plat notations.
2. Accessibility of Recreation Areas. Outdoor recreation areas shall be provided throughout the
development, such that 90 percent of the residential units in the development (and 100
percent of the units in the C sub-district) are located within a one-quarter mile walk of an
outdoor recreation area. For the purpose of this section, a plaza with features that provide
recreational opportunities (e.g., interactive fountain or sculpture, tot lot, etc.) shall be
considered an outdoor recreation area.
PAGE 240 ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS
v. 7.13.2010
L. Relation to Abutting Parcels. Development that is approved pursuant to this Division shall be
designed to be compatible with abutting parcels, in at least one of the following ways:
1. Lot Width and Design. The lot width and design of development at the perimeter of a TND shall
be comparable with the lot width and design of abutting subdivisions. This requirement does
not apply if the abutting parcel is not subdivided.
2. Bufferyard. In the alternative to subsection A., bufferyards may be installed according to the
classifications set out in Section 10.301, Bufferyard Classifications and Bufferyard Model, as
follows:
a. Between the center subdistrict and abutting:
i. Residential development: Class D bufferyard; or
ii. Industrial development: Class E bufferyard;
b. Between the general sub-district and abutting:
i. Residential or commercial development: Class B bufferyard; or
ii. Industrial development: Class E bufferyard;
c. Between the edge sub-district and abutting:
i. Residential development: Class A bufferyard;
ii. Commercial development: Class C bufferyard; or
iii. Industrial development: Class E bufferyard.
Sec. 11.304 Modification of Lot and Yard Standards
A. Generally. The general standards for each housing type are out in Article 2, District Intensity and
Development Standards, which contains lot standards, minimum lot areas and dimensions,
setbacks, building heights, and maximum building coverage for each type of building. These
standards ensure that each building type will have adequate light and air, living area, and yard areas
to provide a quality experience. However, to achieve the design objectives of a TND, it may be
desirable to modify the requirements of Article 2. Accordingly, the lot, yard, and building coverage
standards of Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards, may be modified upon
approval of a Pattern Book that meets the requirements of Section 14.504, Pattern Book
Requirements, and demonstrates compliance with the standards of this Section.
B. Minimum Number of Housing Types. Housing types shall be mixed as required by Section 2.202,
Mix of Housing Types in TNDs and Mixed Housing Neighborhoods.
C. Subdistricts. The applicant shall designate the boundaries of the subdistricts on a map that is
included in the Pattern Book. Patterns shall be provided for each subdistrict.
D. Modification of Setbacks.
1. Range of Modification. Setbacks may be modified, or replaced with "build-to" lines, as provided
in Table 11.304, Reduced Setbacks for TNDs. Setbacks or build-to lines may be established for
subdistricts or for individual street segments, and shall be described in the Pattern Book.
ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS PAGE 241
v. 7.13.2010
Table 11.304
Reduced Setbacks for TNDs
Subdistrict
Setback or Build-To Range
Front Interior Side Street Side Rear
Center 0 to 8 feet As allowed by building code 3 feet or more Any
General 0 to 15 feet As allowed by building code 5 feet or more Any
Edge 10 feet or more 5 feet or more 5 feet or more 20 feet or more
2. Criteria for Modification.
a. Where front setbacks will be less than eight feet, the applicant shall provide drawings in
the Pattern Book that show:
i. How steps giving entry to the homes will be designed;
ii. How a combination of street trees, yard landscaping, and open space configuration
and landscaping provide for a streetscape that compensates for the loss of front yard
landscape area;
iii. That the reduction in the front yard will be offset by an equivalent increase in the rear
yard of the principal building, or the creation of a courtyard or patio on the side of the
building that makes up for the loss of the front and rear yard;
iv. That the lot takes access from an alley; and
v. That the modified front setback will not impact neighboring properties. If the
development has lots that front on an existing street with residential development on
the other side, then the standards of Article 2, District Intensity and Development
Standards shall apply to those lots.
b. Where side setbacks (interior or street) will be modified, the applicant shall demonstrate
that:
i. The buildings will comply with applicable building codes;
ii. There is sufficient spacing to provide for building maintenance and access;
iii. The configuration will not interfere with sight distance requirements; and
iv. With respect to street side yards only, a combination of street trees, yard landscaping,
and open space configuration and landscaping will provide for a streetscape that
compensates for the loss of front yard landscape area.
c. Where rear setbacks will be modified, the applicant shall demonstrate that:
i. The design provides for comparable useable outdoor living space on the lot (e.g.,
through a larger front yard or a courtyard or patio on the side of the house);
ii. The design will not create an unsafe condition for the passage of vehicles and
pedestrians in an abutting alley (if present); and
iii. The design will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of rear or side yards on
abutting lots.
PAGE 242 ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS
v. 7.13.2010
E. Modification of Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions may be modified if it is demonstrated that:
1. The proposed lot sizes will ensure a diversity of development that is consistent with the intent
of the standards of Article 2, District Intensity and Development Standards;
2. The proposed lot sizes are sufficient to provide light and air to all of the dwelling units in the
development;
3. The proposed lot sizes are appropriate to the types of housing that are proposed on the lots;
4. The proposed lot sizes, combined with the permitted building coverage, provide enough room
for useable outdoor living space for all single family detached housing types; and
5. The proposed lot sizes provide enough room for utilities and drainage.
F. Modification of Building Coverage. Building coverage may be modified if lot sizes are reduced, as
follows:
1. For all housing types except townhomes (of any type):
a. The permitted building coverage shall not allow for the complete development of the area
bounded by the setback lines on the lot in order to ensure that buildings are not
monolithic in appearance (compliance with this standard requires a meaningful
articulation of the building); or
b. The permitted building coverage allows for the complete development of the area
bounded by the setback lines on the lot, but another bulk control is used to ensure that the
second floor is articulated to avoid the appearance of a monolithic building.
2. For townhomes, the building coverage may be increased to allow for the complete
development of the area bounded by the setback lines.
Sec. 11.305 Mews Arrangement
A. Generally. The mews arrangement is a site layout in which homes front on a common green, and
vehicular access is by way of alleys so that lots have no street frontage. The mews arrangement is
allowed in TNDs subject to the standards of this Section.
B. Standards. Lots may take alley access and front on mews (common greens) if the alleys are not
longer than 300 feet and do not serve more than 16 dwelling units. See Figure 11.305, Mews
Arrangement.
Figure 11.305

ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS PAGE 243
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 11.306 Accessory Buildings and Detached Garages
A. Generally. Not more than two buildings (in addition to the principal building) shall be permitted on
a lot pursuant to this Section. In some cases, only an accessory building may be allowed.
B. Accessory Buildings.
1. Accessory buildings that are not detached garages are permitted on all residential lots except
through lots, and shall be subject to the standards of Section 2.503, Accessory Buildings and
Structures.
2. Accessory buildings shall have the same architecture and building materials as principal
buildings.
C. Detached Garages. Detached garages are permitted as provided in this subsection. These standards
supersede any standards of Section 2.503, Accessory Buildings and Structures that are in direct
conflict. Where there is no conflict, the standards of Section 2.503, Accessory Buildings and
Structures also apply.
1. Maximum Ground Floor Area.
a. Center (C) subdistrict and General (G) subdistrict: 600 square feet.
b. Edge (E) subdistrict: 800 square feet.
2. Maximum Height.
a. 15 feet if used only as a garage;
b. 35 feet if ancillary dwelling unit is constructed above the garage.
3. Location. Detached garages shall be located behind the principal building or to the side of the
principal building. Such garages shall be set back of at least 25 feet more from the front lot line
than the facade of the principal building.
4. Architecture. Detached garages shall be designed to be architecturally comparable to the
principal building.
Sec. 11.307 Accessory Dwelling Units
A. Generally. Accessory dwelling units ("ADUs") provide a type of housing that can accommodate
small households, which increases the choice of housing opportunities for young adults and the
elderly. They also provide a way for homeowners to invest in their properties in a way that can
produce continuing economic returns by way of rent payments; and a way for elderly or infirm
homeowners to provide housing for on-site caregivers with a higher degree of independence than
other live-in arrangements.
B. Relationship to Density. ADUs are not counted in the calculation of density.
C. New Subdivisions. ADUs may be built in new traditional neighborhood developments that are
approved after the Effective Date of this UDC, provided that compliance with the following
standards is demonstrated:
PAGE 244 ARTICLE 11 DESIGN STANDARDS
v. 7.13.2010
1. Any or all single-family lots that are larger than 6,000 square feet may developed with ADUs,
provided that the site plan or plat specifically designate the lots upon which such development
may occur, or provides a general statement that ADUs are allowed on all single-family lots in
the subdivision.
2. In the required pattern book (see Section 14.504, Pattern Book Requirements), the applicant
shall submit plans showing how the homes will be designed to provide for accessory units. The
units may be within the structure, a separate structure, or above a detached garage. Specific
design standards shall be provided for each one of the arrangements that are to be permitted.
3. The City may place conditions on the designation of lots that abut existing development in
order to ensure compatibility. These conditions may include:
a. A limitation on the lots that abut existing development that may be developed with ADUs
to those which will have the least impact due to the configuration of lots and natural
resources;
b. The designation and installation of a Type B Bufferyard (see Division 10.300, Bufferyards)
along the property lines that divide the parcel proposed for development from existing
development; or
c. A limitation on the types and designs of ADUs that may be constructed on lots that abut
existing development.
D. Limitations.
1. Not more than one ADU shall be constructed on a single-family lot.

than 80 feet.
C. Parking Garages.
1. The perception of the bulk (or mass) of a parking garage as seen from the street shall be
minimized by orienting the garage so that its short dimension along the street edge of the
street with the highest functional classification upon which the lot fronts.
2. Generally, the parking garage shall include active uses such as retail or other appropriate uses
at the ground level and/or along the street frontage, or shall be located behind the principal
building (see Figure 11.604A, Illustrative Parking Garage with Liner Buildings).

Illustrative Parking Garage with Liner Buildings
3. Where the dimensions of the parcel proposed for development do not accommodate the active
use of the street frontage, parking structures and vehicle entrances shall be designed to
minimize views into the garage interior from surrounding streets and sidewalks. Methods to
help minimize such views may include, but are not limited to landscaping, planters masonry
walls up to 3.5 feet in height, and decorative grilles and screens. The frontage along the garage
shall include street furniture at intervals of not more than 80 feet (see Figure 11.604B,

ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
Division 12.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 12.101 Purpose of Article
A. Generally. Applying new regulations to existing development is likely to create situations where
existing lot dimensions, development density or intensity, land uses, buildings, structures,
landscaping, parking areas, or signs do not strictly comply with the new requirements. The NC
district is intended to minimize these "nonconformities" in established neighborhoods by making
existing buildings and lots that were lawfully constructed or created "conforming." For existing lots
or development (including uses, buildings, structures, and signs) that are "legally nonconforming,"
this Article sets out fair rules for whether, when, and how the regulations of this UDC apply.
B. Expansion of Nonconformities. Generally, nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and signs are
not allowed to be enlarged, expanded, increased, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses that are now prohibited in the same zoning district. This Article provides
standards by which minor nonconforming uses can be made "conforming" through a public hearing
process.
C. Reduction of Nonconformities. It is the policy of the City to encourage reinvestments in property
that increase its value and utility and improve its quality and character. Since bringing a developed
parcel into full compliance with this UDC may involve substantial cost (which could discourage
reinvestment), this Article provides a set of thresholds for determining when new construction or
modifications to development trigger a requirement for meeting the various standards of this UDC.
D. Unlawful Uses, Buildings, Structures, or Signs. This Article does not authorize or legitimize uses,
buildings, structures, or signs that were not legally established or constructed. Such uses, buildings,
structures, or signs are not "legally nonconforming," but instead remain "unlawful," and are subject
to all of the provisions of this UDC (including enforcement provisions) and any other applicable law.
Likewise, this Article does not legitimize unlawful subdivisions of property that may have occurred
before the effective date of this UDC.
Sec. 12.102 Application of Article
A. Generally. This Article applies to uses, buildings, structures, landscaping, signs, parking, and lots
that were lawfully constructed or established, but do not conform to the requirements of this UDC.
It does not apply to lots of record in the NC zoning district, regardless of their size (such lots are
"conforming").
B. Types of Nonconformities. There are seven general types of nonconformities: uses, buildings,
structures, landscaping, signs, parking, and lots. As to uses, nonconformities may be "major" or
"minor." These types are set out in Section 12.102, Types and Classes of Nonconformities. The
application of the standards of this Article is based on the type of nonconformity that is being
addressed.
C. General Regulations. Division 12.300, General Regulations, sets out the standards for when
nonconforming situations must be made conforming (or more conforming) or, alternatively,
PAGE 262 ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
v. 7.13.2010
terminated or removed. It also sets out the circumstances in which a nonconforming situation may
be restored or resumed after damage, destruction, or temporary cessation.
D. Compliance Thresholds. Division 12.400, Compliance Thresholds, sets out the standards for
determining when new construction or modifications to development trigger a requirement for
conformity with the various requirements of this UDC.
E. Conversion of Nonconformities. Division 12.500, Conversion of Nonconformities, sets out how to
convert a nonconforming use to a conforming use using a conditional use process. Nonconforming
buildings and structures may be made conforming with a variance. See Section 14.507, Variance
Requirements.
F. Effect of Article.
1. Effect on Existing Development Entitlements. Nothing in this UDC shall be interpreted to require
a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building in which a building permit
was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this UDC, provided
construction was commenced within 60 days after obtaining said building permit and diligently
completed.
2. Effect on Existing Unlawful Uses, Buildings, Signs, and Structures. Any use, building, structure
and/or parcel of land which was used, erected or maintained in violation of any previous
Zoning Regulations shall not be considered as a legal, nonconforming use, building structure
and/or parcel, and shall be required to comply with all provisions of this UDC.
Division 12.200 Types and Classes of Nonconformities
Sec. 12.201 Nonconforming Uses
A. Generally. A nonconforming use is a use of land that was lawfully established (i.e., it was allowed
and issued a permit, if a permit was required at the time the use was established) on a parcel or lot
before the effective date of this UDC, that is no longer allowed after the effective date of this UDC.
Amendments to this UDC may also make uses nonconforming. The following uses are legally
nonconforming uses:
1. Uses that were lawfully established but are not currently listed as Permitted, Limited, or
Conditional Uses in the district in Division 1.300, Permitted, Limited, Conditional, and Prohibited
Uses.
2. Uses that are listed as Limited Uses in the district in Division 1.300, Permitted, Limited,
Conditional, and Prohibited Uses, but were lawfully established without a limited use permit
and do not comply with the applicable standards of Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use
Standards.
3. Uses that are listed as Conditional Uses in the district in Division 1.300, Permitted, Limited,
Conditional, and Prohibited Uses, but were lawfully established without a conditional use
permit. For these uses, the nonconforming use status may be removed by obtaining a
conditional use permit.
ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES PAGE 263
v. 7.13.2010
4. Uses that were lawfully established within a floodplain or floodway, but are no longer
permitted in the floodplain or floodway.
B. Classifications of Nonconforming Uses. There are two types of nonconforming uses: major
nonconforming uses and minor nonconforming uses. The classification of the nonconforming use
affects whether it can be converted to a conforming use.
1. Major Nonconforming Uses. Major nonconforming uses are those uses for which the
nonconformity generates a nuisance per se or represents such incompatibility with adjacent
uses and/or the Comprehensive Plan that public policy favors their elimination from the district
if they are discontinued, abandoned, or destroyed. Major nonconforming uses are:
a. Mobile homes
2. Minor Nonconforming Uses. All nonconforming uses that are not classified as major
nonconforming uses are minor nonconforming uses. Such uses may be converted to
conforming uses as provided in Division 12.500, Conversion of Nonconformities.
Sec. 12.202 Nonconforming Buildings
A nonconforming building is a building that was lawfully constructed prior to the effective date of this
UDC (or amendment hereto) that does not conform to the height, yard, building coverage, density,
intensity, building scale, or design standards that are applicable to the same type of building in the
district in which the building is located.
Sec. 12.203 Nonconforming Structures
A nonconforming structure is a structure other than a building that was lawfully constructed prior to the
effective date of this UDC (or amendment hereto) that does not conform to the standards that are
applicable to the same type of structure in the district in which the structure is located. The following
are illustrative examples of nonconforming structures:
1. Fences or garden walls that do not comply with the height, setback, or materials standards of
this UDC; and
2. Structures that are located in floodplains, floodways, or open space areas that do not comply
with the applicable regulations of this UDC.
Sec. 12.204 Nonconforming Landscaping
A. Generally. Nonconforming landscaping is landscaping (or lack thereof) that does not conform to the
landscape area or planting requirements of Article 10, Landscaping or other provisions of this UDC
that require the designation of open space or landscape surface areas or the buffering of uses (see,
e.g., Division 1.400, Limited and Conditional Use Standards, and Article 2, District Intensity and
Development Standards). Nonresidential, mixed-use, and multifamily residential parcels that were
lawfully developed but do not include the required landscape surface ratio or open space ratio that
is required after the effective date of this UDC or amendment hereto are also nonconforming with
respect to landscaping.
PAGE 264 ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
v. 7.13.2010
B. Exception. Residential development of housing types other than multifamily is conforming with
respect to landscaping if it was platted prior to the effective date of this UDC.
Sec. 12.205 Nonconforming Signs
A. Permanent Signs. Any permanent sign located within the City limits on the effective date of this
UDC that does not conform to the provisions of Article 5, Signs, or, if applicable, Division 1.400,
Limited and Conditional Use Standards, is a "legal nonconforming" sign, provided it also meets the
following requirements:
1. The sign was approved by a sign permit on the effective date of this UDC, or amendment
hereto, if a permit was required under applicable law; or
2. If no sign permit was required under applicable law for the sign in question, the sign:
a. Was in all respects in conformity with the applicable law (or there was no applicable law)
immediately prior to the effective date; or
b. Had legal nonconforming status at such time.
B. Temporary Signs. Temporary signs that are not in compliance with this UDC shall be removed as
required by Article 5, Signs.
Sec. 12.206 Nonconforming Parking
Nonconforming parking refers to parking spaces, drive aisles, and loading areas that do not conform to
the requirements of this code that are set out in Article 9, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting, in
terms of their number or dimensions.
Sec. 12.207 Nonconforming Lots
A. Generally. Nonconforming lots are lots that were lawfully created before the effective date of this
UDC or amendments hereto, but which no longer comply with the lot width, frontage, area, or
access requirements of this UDC.
B. Exception. All lots within NC districts that were lawfully created before the effective date of this
UDC are conforming, regardless of their dimensions.
Division 12.300 General Regulations
Sec. 12.301 Termination, Restoration, and Removal
A. Generally. This Section sets out the standards for when a nonconformity must be terminated or
removed, and when it is allowed to be restored after temporary cessation, damage or destruction.
B. Nonconforming Uses.
1. If a major nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months, for any reason, it shall
not be resumed.
2. If a minor nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months, for any reason, it shall
not be resumed. However, if an application for conversion of the use is filed pursuant to
ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES PAGE 265
v. 7.13.2010
Division 12.500, Conversion of Nonconformities, before the end of the six month period, the use
may be resumed as a conforming use after the period expires if the application is granted.
C. Nonconforming Buildings, Structures, and Elements of Buildings or Structures.
1. If a nonconforming building or structure or nonconforming element thereof is damaged or
destroyed by any means, or be declared unsafe by the Building Inspector to an extent that
repairs would exceed more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the building or
damaged nonconforming element, the building shall be reconstructed in conformity with the
provisions of this UDC.
2. If the reconstruction cost and/or area of reconstruction (whichever is less) is less than or equal
to 50 percent of the cost of replacement or area of the building, respectively, then the
structure may be strengthened or restored to a safe condition provided that:
a. The original nonconformity is not enlarged, increased, or extended;
b. Building permits are obtained for repairs within 12 months of the date the building was
damaged or, if no date can be reasonably established for the damage, the date that the
building inspector determines that the building is unsafe; and
c. The construction is commenced within 12 months after obtaining the required building
permits.
D. Nonconforming Landscaping. Nonconforming landscaping shall be made conforming as provided in
Division 12.400, Compliance Thresholds.
E. Nonconforming Signs or Sign Elements.
1. A nonconforming sign which has been damaged by fire, wind or other cause in excess of 50
percent of its replacement cost shall not be restored except in conformance with this UDC.
2. If a nonconforming sign structure is does not display any message for a period of three months,
it shall be removed or brought into conformance with this UDC.
3. If a nonconforming sign structure is removed for any reason other than routine repair and
maintenance, it shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this UDC.
4. Nonconforming signs that are a danger to the public safety due to damage or wear shall be
removed and shall not be replaced unless the replacement sign conforms to this UDC.
Sec. 12.302 Changes of Use
A. Generally. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
B. Effect of Change of Use.
1. If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall not be
resumed.
2. If the use of only a portion of a building or property is changed from a nonconforming use to a
conforming use, then the use of that portion of the building or property shall not be changed
back to the nonconforming use.
PAGE 266 ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 12.303 Repairs and Modifications
A. Generally. Repairs and modifications to nonconforming buildings, structures and signs is permitted
as provided in this Section, except that nonconforming buildings and structures that are located in
floodplains are subject to the restrictions of Section 12.305, Nonconforming Buildings and
Structures in Floodplains, and not this Section.
B. Repairs and Alterations.
1. Buildings and Structures. Routine maintenance of nonconforming buildings and structures is
permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs, paint, and incidental alterations which do
not extend or intensify the nonconforming buildings or structures or materially extend their
life. This standard also applies to buildings or structures that are used by nonconforming uses if
they are designed in a way that is not suitable for re-use as a conforming use (if the building is
conforming and could be re-used for a conforming use, there is no limitation on its
maintenance).
2. Buildings Containing Major Nonconforming Uses. No building or structure that contains a major
nonconforming use shall be enlarged unless the major nonconforming use is permanently
discontinued.
3. Signs. Routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is permitted, including non-structural
repairs and paint (even if such repairs would materially extend the life of the sign), changes to
the sign face or messages, and incidental alterations that do not increase the nonconformity or
sign area. Structural repairs or changes are not allowed. If the sign requires structural repairs
because it has been damaged, destroyed, or worn, it shall be removed or altered in accordance
with subsection B.4., below.
4. Structural Alterations. Structural alterations to nonconforming buildings, structures, and signs
are permitted only if it is demonstrated that the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity or
reduce it in accordance with the standards of Division 12.400, Compliance Thresholds.
C. Expansion of Nonconforming Uses.
1. Major Nonconforming Uses. Major nonconforming uses shall not be expanded, enlarged,
extended, increased, or moved to occupy an area of land or building that was not occupied on
the effective date of this UDC or any amendment that made the use a major nonconforming
use.
2. Minor Nonconforming Uses. No minor nonconforming use shall be expanded or extended in
such a way as to:
a. Occupy any open space or landscaped area that is required by this UDC;
b. Exceed building coverage, intensity, or height limitations of the zoning district in which the
use is located;
c. Occupy any land beyond the boundaries of the property or lot as it existed on the effective
date of this UDC; or
d. Displace any conforming use in the same building or on the same parcel.
ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES PAGE 267
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 12.304 Nonconforming Lots; Combination and Construction
A. Combination of Lots to Increase Conformity.
1. Where a landowner owns several abutting lots that do not conform to the dimensional
requirements of the district in which they are located, they shall combined to create fully
conforming lots or, if full conformity is not possible, they shall be combined if the combination
will increase the degree of conformity. See Figure 12.304, Combination of Nonconforming Lots.
2. The City will not require the combination of lots pursuant to paragraph A.1., above, if:
a. The combination of lots would not address the nonconformity (see Figure 12.304,
Combination of Nonconforming Lots);
b. The combination of lots would materially disrupt the lotting pattern of the street, for
example, by creating a through lot mid-block on a street segment that does not include
any other through lots (see Figure 12.304, Combination of Nonconforming Lots);
c. Two or more of the lots are developed with principal buildings, and the combination of lots
would require that one or more of the buildings be torn down in order to comply with this
UDC (see Figure 12.304, Combination of Nonconforming Lots);
d. The combination of lots would result in regularly shaped lots being combined into a single
lot with an irregular shape (see Figure 12.304, Combination of Nonconforming Lots); or
e. The lots are located in the NC district (in which case they are not nonconforming).
Figure 12.304
Combination of Nonconforming Lots
B. Construction on Legal Lots That Do Not Conform to Dimensional Requirements. A legal lot that
does not meet district requirements with respect to lot area or lot width may be built upon if:
1. The lot is a lot of record; and
2. The use is permitted in the district in which the lot is located;
PAGE 268 ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES
v. 7.13.2010
3. The lot has sufficient frontage on a public street to provide access that is appropriate for the
proposed use; and
4. All yards or height standards are complied with, except that the responsible official may
authorize a reduction of required yards of up to 10 percent, provided that the the responsible
official finds that the reduction does not allow a building that would be larger than a building
that would be permitted on the minimum conforming lot in the district.
Sec. 12.305 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures in Floodplains
It is the intent of the City of Zachary that no permanent structures be located or substantially improved
in the floodplain, except according to the standards in Chapter 46, Flood Damage Prevention, of the City
of Zachary Code of Ordinances, and that existing legal nonconforming buildings, structures, and signs
shall be removed upon abandonment, destruction, or substantial damage.
Sec. 12.306 Nonconforming Parking
A. Generally. Nonconforming parking and loading areas are subject to the regulations of this Section.
B. Number of Parking Spaces.
1. Building Expansions. If an existing building or use is expanded, additional parking shall be
required only in proportion to the new area of the building or use.
2. Change of Use. If the use of a building changes, resulting in additional demand for parking,
additional parking shall be provided in an amount equal to the difference between the
requirements of the former use (not the actual parking provided on-site) and the requirements
for the new use, as set out in Division 9.200, Parking and Loading Calculations. However, a
permit for the new use may be denied if the available parking is less than 75 percent of the
required parking.
3. Redevelopment. If an existing building is redeveloped, parking shall be provided as required by
Article 9, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting.
C. Size of Parking Spaces and Drive Aisles. Parking spaces and drive aisles shall be sized according to
the requirements of Article 9, Parking, Loading, Access, and Lighting, when so required by Division
12.400, Compliance Thresholds.
Sec. 12.307 Nonconformity Created by Public Action
Any nonconforming structure or land expressly created or caused by a conveyance of privately owned
land to a federal, state or local government to serve a public purpose is conforming for the purposes of
this UDC, and is not subject to the limitations of this Article. This exemption applies only in cases where
private land is obtained by a governmental entity for a public purpose, through condemnation, threat of
condemnation or otherwise, which creates a nonconformity in the remainder parcel in terms of setback,
lot size, or other standards of this UDC. This exemption does not apply to right-of-way dedication or
other public conveyances of land required by the City in the course of subdivision or other routine
development plan approvals.

Division 12.400 Compliance Thresholds
Sec. 12.401 Purpose and Intent
The purpose and intent of this Division is to encourage reinvestment in existing buildings and properties
by mitigating the costs of retrofitting existing buildings and sites to achieve full compliance with this
UDC. This Division does not relate to building code compliance or compliance with applicable
engineering standards.
Sec. 12.402 Sliding Scale Compliance Requirements

1. Building improvements shall comply with code
requirements that directly relate to the
improvements.
2. Landscaping improvements must further the
objectives of Article 10, Landscaping (e.g., if the only
improvement is planting trees, full compliance with
the landscaping requirements is not required, but
trees that are planted must comply with code
requirements).
3. Safety improvements must be made in a manner
that is proportionate to the level of investment.
Parking lot improvements Drainage, expansion, or reconstruction improvements,
but not restriping alone unless the restriping according
to the standards of Article 9, Parking, Loading, Access,

existing parking spaces by more than 10 percent.
1. Parking spaces and drive aisles shall be
dimensioned, and loading shall be provided, as
required by Article 9, Parking, Loading, Access, and
Lighting.
2. Parking lot landscaping shall be provided as
required by Section 10.203, Parking Lot Landscaping,
even if it results in a reduction in the number of
parking spaces, but only to the extent that the
reduction does not result in a parking lot that contains
less than 95 percent of the required parking spaces.
Division 12.500 Conversion of Nonconformities
Sec. 12.501 Purpose
Many minor nonconforming uses have existed for a period of time, and some may have only recently
become nonconforming. In many instances, minor nonconforming uses are integral parts of the City's
fabric, that is, its character and function, so their continuing existence promotes the City's policy
objective of protecting its neighborhoods. In these instances, the classification "nonconformity" and
resulting restriction on investment may not be what the community desires. As such, the use may be
made conforming pursuant to this Division in order to remove the potential stigma that may be
associated with the "nonconforming" designation.
Sec. 12.502 Procedure
A. Generally. An owner of a minor nonconforming use may apply for a conditional use permit which
has the effect of making the nonconforming use conforming. The criteria for conditional use
approval are set out in
B. Exclusions. This procedure does not apply to nonconforming lots, which may be buildable in
accordance with the standards of Section 12.304, Nonconforming Lots; Combination and
Construction.
Sec. 12.503 Criteria for Approval
A. Generally. A conditional use approval may be granted to make a nonconforming building, structure,
use, or sign conforming, if, in addition to the criteria for approval of a conditional use set forth in
Section 14.501, Conditional Use Requirements, all of the criteria of this Section are satisfied.
ARTICLE 12 NONCONFORMITIES PAGE 271
v. 7.13.2010
B. Approval Criteria. The use, as conducted and managed, has minimal nonconformities and has been
integrated into the neighborhood's (or district's if it is not in or adjacent to a residential
neighborhood) function, as evidenced by the following demonstrations:
1. The neighborhood residents regularly patronize or are employed at said use (for nonresidential
uses in or abutting residential neighborhoods).
2. Management practices eliminate nuisances such as noise, light, waste materials, unreasonably
congested on-street parking, or similar conflicts.
3. There is no material history of complaints about the use (a history of complaints is justification
for denying the conditional use permit, unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the
sources of the complaints).
4. The use has been maintained in good condition and its classification as a nonconformity would
be a disincentive for such maintenance.
C. Conditions. Conditions may be imposed relative to the expansion of bufferyards, landscaping, or
other site design provisions, or other limitations necessary to ensure that, as a conforming use, the
use will not become a nuisance. Such conditions may relate to the lot, buildings, structures, or
operation of the use.
Sec. 12.504 Effect and Annotation
A. Generally. Uses that comply with the terms of a conditional use permit issued in accordance with
this Division are converted from "legally nonconforming uses" to "conforming uses" by virtue of the
issuance of the permit.
B. Written Approval. Conditional use approvals shall be provided to the applicant in writing and may
be recorded by the applicant at the applicant's expense.
C. Annotation of Official Zoning Map. Upon granting a conditional use permit and the applicant's
demonstration of compliance with any conditions placed upon it, the Director shall place an
annotation on the Zoning Map that states that the property has a conditional use permit, as well as
the permit number and date of approval.

Sec. 14.302 Combinations
A. Generally. Combinations (except single-owner combinations, described in subsection D., below) are

Combinations are a way for neighboring landowners to sell property to each other without
extensive review.
B. Required Approval. Approval of the City Council is required.
C. Application Materials. Applications shall require, at a minimum, the following information:
1. A copy of the proposed deed.
2. A sketch of the property that is the subject of the transaction.
3. A sketch of the parent tract with the property that is the subject of the transaction removed.
4. An executed covenant, to be recorded with the deed, that requires the property that is the
subject of the deed to be combined with the purchaser's property under unity of title. The
original lots or parcels of land that are combined pursuant to this Section are not considered to
be "lots of record," and may not be separately conveyed to third parties except pursuant to this
UDC.
D. Approval Standards. The Public Works Director shall approve combinations if it is demonstrated
that:
1. The combination does not increase the lot area of a lot in a Neighborhood Conservation district
to more than two times the minimum lot area of the subdistrict, as set out in Table 1.201B,
Neighborhood Conservation Subdistricts.
2. The property that will be retained by the seller will meet the applicable requirements of this

E. Single-Owner Combinations. Where "lots of record" (i.e., lots created by formal subdivision prior to
the effective date of these regulations) are held in common as of the effective date, said lots shall
be combined to create a lot that conforms to these regulations, or if the holdings are insufficient to
create a conforming lot, a combined lot that is more compliant with these regulations than the two
separate lots.

of lots for family members or to provide income for farmers or foresters without a requirement for
investment in significant infrastructure. This Section permits a portion of a farm, wood lot, or tract
of rural land to be developed as a minor subdivision, and does not preclude later subdivision of the
balance of the property. This process is not intended to supplant simpler procedures, in that minor
subdivisions that also qualify as combinations pursuant to Section 14.302, Combinations, shall be
processed pursuant to Section 14.302.
B. Required Approval. Approval of the City Council is required.
C. Application Materials. Applications shall require, at a minimum, the following information:
1. A survey of that part of the parcel proposed for subdivision that is subject to the application for
minor subdivision, including enough detail to show the proposed new lots, existing wells and
individual sewerage treatment systems, and the context of lots with respect to the original
parcel and abutting property within 300 feet of any lot line, and compliance with this UDC.
2. A proposed plat containing the proposed parcel or lot lines, which demonstrates compliance
with this UDC.
D. Number of Lots Permitted. The number of lots permitted in a minor subdivision is the lesser of:
1. Eight new lots (i.e., the "residual parcel," which is remainder of the parent tract, plus eight
lots); or
2. 20 percent of the maximum number of lots that could be platted on the parent tract pursuant
to these subdivision regulations.
E. Access. No new lot shall take direct access to an existing street. Lots created by minor subdivision
shall take access from an easement that is not less than 60 feet wide, platted as part of the residual
parcel, which shall be paved to a width of at least 18 feet. However, no access shall be subsequently
accepted by the City as a public street unless the right-of-way and paving meets City standards for
width and pavement.
F. Residual Parcel. The remainder of the property after new lots are created pursuant to this Section is
called the residual parcel. Further minor subdivision of residual parcels is not allowed. However, the
residual parcel may be further subdivided by standard subdivision at a later date.
PAGE 286 ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
v. 7.13.2010
G. Restrictions on Residual Parcel. Covenants, conditions, and restrictions shall be recorded in the
chain of title of the residual parcel pursuant to this subsection. Such covenants, conditions, and
restrictions shall run with the land, and shall include all of the following:
1. The total number of lots that are permitted on the residual parcel pursuant to these
regulations. This number is equal to the permitted density of the parcel proposed for
subdivision times the area of the parcel proposed for subdivision, minus the number of new
lots created pursuant to this Section.
2. The development type upon which the permitted density in subsection G.1. is based.
3. The total amount of open space that must be protected on the residual parcel based on its
eventual anticipated development type. Alternatively, some or all of such open space may be
protected on the minor subdivision plat.
4. An easement of access to the subdivided lots and the residual parcel. The easement shall
require, at the developer's expense, the installation of roads, drainage, and utilities that meet
City standards when the residual parcel is developed.
5. A covenant that any subsequent development will include all street improvements in the
access easement at no expense to the owners of lots served by the initial access easement.
Street improvements in the initial access easement shall be the first work to be completed in
any subsequent development of the residual parcel.
H. Existing Buildings. An existing home may be located on a subdivided lot or the residual parcel. It
counts as one of the total dwelling units that are permitted on the site, but if located on the
residual parcel, it shall not be counted against the lot total for the rural subdivision.

negatively affect the anticipated development or redevelopment trajectory;
2. There is no practicable alternative location where the use is permitted as-of-right within onequarter
mile of the parcel proposed for development, or, if such a location exists, the proposed
location is more favorable in terms of providing a needed community service to a population
that has limited mobility;
3. The approval of the conditional use will not create a critical mass of similar conditional uses
that is likely to tend to discourage permitted uses by making the vicinity less desirable for
them; and
ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES PAGE 291
v. 7.13.2010
4. The conditional use is conducted in a manner that is not materially more disruptive to adjacent
properties than other permitted uses in the district unless the conditional use is temporary and
the duration of the use is limited to minimize the impact. Conditions of approval may be
attached to the conditional use to ensure that this requirement is satisfied.
D. Annotation of Zoning Map. If the application is approved, the Official Zoning Map shall be
annotated to reference the approval by resolution number.

v. 7.13.2010
Planning and Zoning Commission shall not continue a hearing on a sign design program without the
consent of the applicant.
Sec. 14.504 Pattern Book Requirements
A. Generally. The pattern book is a design guide for a specific development. It is submitted by the
applicant to address the design of individual buildings or dwellings. The pattern book ensures that
the development will be attractive and harmonious. The pattern book:
1. Provides a palette of development styles and materials (as such, it addresses the design
elements not the use or intensity of development);
2. Provides details of streetscape design and landscaping; and
3. May provide for specific modifications of the requirements of this UDC in order to ensure that
the development is a cohesive whole.
B. Application.
1. An application for Pattern Book approval shall accompany all applications for approval of a
Traditional Neighborhood Development, and any application for approval of a mixed-housing
neighborhood which also seeks to deviate from minimum lot size, lot averaging, lot width, or
setback requirements.
2. The Pattern Book shall include the following elements:
a. A description of each type of housing that is proposed.
b. Standards for lot dimensions for each type of housing, expressed either as lot width and lot
depth or lot width and lot area. Such standards may be expressed as averages.
c. Standards for setbacks or build-to lines for front, street side, interior side, and rear lot
lines, which may be different for principal buildings and accessory buildings. Such
standards may be presented in tabular or illustrated format.
d. Standards for yards or courtyards, if different from areas between required setback lines
and lot lines.
e. Standards for the design of each type of building (residential, nonresidential, and mixeduse)
that is proposed in the development, which shall include:
i. Architectural style / typology;
ii. Typical architectural elements for each style / typology; and
iii. Typical building materials for each style / typology.
f. A collection of illustrative elevations for each architectural style / typology, with standards
that will ensure diversity of architectural presentation; or a collection of proposed
elevations for each architectural style / typology, which demonstrates diversity of
architectural presentation.
g. Standards for fences and garden walls, if different from those set out in Section 4.05,
Fences and Garden Walls.
ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES PAGE 293
v. 7.13.2010
h. Standards for accessory buildings, if different from those set out in Article 2, District
Intensity and Development Standards.
C. Decision Criteria. Upon recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council
shall review the pattern book to ensure that it will accomplish the following objectives:
1. Limitations on Modulation. Pattern books may modulate residential development standards if
the modulations occur in the following ranges:
a. Front setbacks (or build-to lines) are in the following ranges:
i. Center Subdistrict: 0 ft. to 8 ft.
ii. General Subdistrict: 0 ft. to 15 ft.
iii. Edge Subdistrict: 10 ft. or more
b. Side setbacks shall comply with applicable fire codes.
2. Harmony. The municipality, neighborhood, and development should be harmonious. Harmony
is defined as the middle, or balance, of two continuums, both of which have ends that, at their
extremes, are unattractive. The balance shall be struck between:
a. Monotony and chaos; and
b. Unity and interest.
3. Quality. Quality not only refers to the materials and care with which a building or environment
is built, but also to its visual richness (e.g., details that are attractive to the resident or visitor).
In order to ensure visual interest, the pattern book shall demonstrate the following:
a. Single-Family homes (attached or detached) are designed to provide a unit that has a
unified appearance from the street with any street façade (front façade and street side
façade), having comparable treatment in materials, color, and trim.
b. If masonry is used on a front façade, it is also applied to side facades in one or more of the
following ways:
i. Masonry returns to a break in the side façade, such as a chimney, room projection, or
projecting window area;
ii. An architectural return is applied to all corners so that the greater of ten percent of
the length of the side building wall or three feet is finished with masonry to the same
height as the front facade;
iii. Quoins are used, if consistent with the architectural typology of the building;
iv. An architectural detail with a minimum width of 16 inches is applied, such as a pilaster
that caps the masonry and the other material that completes the corner; or
v. A wing wall screens the view of the side of the building from the street.
c. Detached single-family homes will be articulated and detailed, and shall avoid undue
imposition of building mass on the street.
PAGE 294 ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
v. 7.13.2010
d. There should be some detailing or doors, windows and their trim that carries around the
buildings sides so that even if the trim is plainer, they show a relationship to the general
style and character of the front.
e. Front porches will be provided on all detached housing types within 1,320 feet along street
centerlines from the Center subdistrict, and may be provided elsewhere and on other
housing types.
f. Balconies will be provided on all multistory townhomes and multistory multifamily
buildings.
g. Utility meters shall not be on front or side elevations unless screened by vegetation or
other approved screening.
4. Diversity. The pattern book shall demonstrate that one or more of the techniques below will be
used to achieve harmony (the pattern book is not required to include all of these elements):
a. Varied Housing Types at a Fine-Grained Scale. Multiple housing types are required, yet this
requirement could result in areas or pods of each type, which has the potential to lead to
monotony. Mixing types on a smaller scale, even having differing dwelling unit types in a
block face, is a technique to reduce monotony and add interest.
b. Varied Architectural Styles. Different architectural styles (e.g., Colonial Revival and
Neoclassical) can be used to vary the appearance of buildings with comparable floor plans.
The variations in architectural styles must be meaningful, but must not create a chaotic
appearance. For this technique to be reviewed, a number of elements, including roof type
and orientation, roof pitch, eve overhangs, windows, doors, decorative elements shall be
specified for each architectural style that will be used in the TND. The reference for
architectural style shall be A Field Guide to American Houses by Virginia and Lee McAlester,
et al. (Knopf 1984).
c. Varied Floor Plans. If floor plans are meaningfully different, homes will look different. If
floor plans are not meaningfully different, homes will often look monotonous. The
differences in floor plans must significantly alter the width and shape in order to present a
building volume or mass that is different. Such differences include, but are not limited to:
i. Minimum of 10 percent difference in front façade width; or
ii. Different forms (rectangle, L, or X shapes), if the differences affect the front façade; or
iii. Different numbers of stories; or
iv. Different symmetry (symmetrical or asymmetrical).
d. Varied Gable Orientation. In many cases, a front or side gable roof can be constructed over
the same floor plan. This change significantly alters the roof profile of the house, its front
elevation massing, and may also alter the height of the roof peak.
e. Varied Elements. The pattern book may demonstrate that architectural elements will be
varied in a way that creates meaningful differences in building appearance. Such details
may include trims, materials, color, window arrangement (grouping), window fenestration,
doors, door lights, window and garage doors, porches, chimneys, bay windows, towers,
ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES PAGE 295
v. 7.13.2010
and balconies, as necessary to create the required variation. This technique is particularly
useful when a single architectural style, or two very closely related styles (e.g., Prairie and
Craftsman) are used in the development. The pattern book must include detailed
elevations, lists of specific elements to be used, and an explanation of how the elements
will be mixed to differentiate nearby buildings.
f. Averaged Lot Width. Meaningful variation of lot width generally causes meaningful
variations in building width and floor plan. A pattern book may show that block faces will
include lots of varying widths, as follows:
i. Three lots size categories for each type of housing are created, using a required
average (e.g., 50 percent of the lots would be average, 25 percent small, and the
remainder large).
ii. The difference in frontage among the lot sizes should be in the range of 10 to 20
percent. For example, an average 10,000 square foot lot that is 80 feet wide is 125
feet deep. The small lot could be 70 feet wide, and the large lot 90 feet wide. The
resulting lots, all 125 feet deep, would have areas of 8,750, 10,000, and 11,250 square
feet.
5. Light and Air. The pattern of development, and the open space available on each lot and for the
community are such that adequate light and air are provided for residents. Residents of the
General Subdistrict and Edge Subdistrict shall have a private outdoor space that is at least 100
square feet in dimension, and which may be a rear lawn, courtyard, patio, deck, or useable
rooftop area.
6. Pedestrian-Orientation. The pattern book shall demonstrate that the residential areas of the
development are designed for the comfort and convenience of the pedestrian, with continuous
sidewalks; tree-lined, traffic-calmed streets; and architecture that provides street-level interest
and accessibility.
D. Conditions of Approval. The City Council may place conditions of approval on the Pattern Book as
necessary to ensure compliance with the decision criteria of subsection C., above.
E. Prohibited Issues. The City Council will not impose conditions on the Pattern Book that:
1. Limit density, intensity, amount of open space, or land use in a manner that is different from
the requirements of this UDC.
2. Address the design of the development, in ways that are covered in the preliminary plat or site
plan review. The pattern book approval shall defer any overall plan layout issues to be
addressed in the plat approval.
Sec. 14.505 Preliminary Plat Requirements
A. Generally.
1. All plans for the subdivision of land shall conform with preliminary plan, the requirements of
the laws of the state (specifically R.S. 35:5051 et seq.), governing surveying, platting and
subdivision of land and to the subdivision regulation as contained here and all other applicable
ordinances of the City and all amendments thereto.
PAGE 296 ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES
v. 7.13.2010
2. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to show graphically all facts needed to enable the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Engineer and other City agencies to determine
whether the proposed layout of the land in question is satisfactory from the standpoint of
public interest and will meet the requirements of this UDC. Changes may be necessary in the
preliminary plan before it can be tentatively approved. Application.
B. Application. Applications for preliminary plat approval shall be on a form approved by the Public
Works Director, and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
1. Scale. The preliminary plat shall be drawn to a scale of one-inch equals 100 feet or less. If the
subdivision contains more than 160 acres, the preliminary plat may be drawn to a scale of one
inch equals 200 feet.
2. Title. The title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded; the location of the
property to be subdivided; the name of the owner or owners and/or the subdivider; and the
name of the engineer, surveyor or landscape architect, if any, who is platting the tract.
3. Boundary Lines and Existing Improvements. Boundaries of the subdivision location; width and
names of streets adjoining the subdivision; section and township lines; indication of
incorporated areas, sewer districts, zoning districts, school districts and other legally

and approximate dimensions of lots; any other necessary descriptions of lots, servitudes and
easements; and location and dimensions of existing buildings, if any; and subdivider's front
building lines with setbacks. The lots shall not encroach on major drainage servitude or rightsof-
way and all such servitude or rights-of-way shall be excluded from lot area.
6. Sewers, Waterlines, and Drainage Ditches. Existing drainage ditches, sanitary and storm sewers,
water mains, culverts, and other underground structures within the tract or immediately
adjacent; statement of proposed plans for drainage and sewage disposal, including location of
proposed culverts and bridges and a contour map where terrain might affect location of sewers
and ditches.
7. Open Space. The areas of protected open space, as required by the applicable open space ratio
or landscape surface ratio.
8. Public Utilities. The location of all existing and proposed public utilities including storm and
sanitary sewers, water, gas and power lines.
9. Resource Protection Areas. Areas set aside for resource protection, as required by Article 3,
Open Space and Environmental Quality.

other special uses of land to be considered for dedication to public use.
ARTICLE 14 PERMITS AND PROCEDURES PAGE 297
v. 7.13.2010
12. North Point, Scale and Date. North point, scale, and date.
13. Vicinity Map. A key or vicinity map, showing the area to be subdivided in relation to the nearest
major street or road.
C. Decision Criteria. Approval of a preliminary plan is a tentative approval only and does not constitute
the approval of a record plat. The application shall be evaluated based upon:
1. Its compliance with the applicable requirements of this UDC.
2. A finding that the proposed development does not place an undue burden upon public facilities
or infrastructure, including but not limited to:
a. Inefficient street networks causing undue congestion of streets and traffic access;
b. Building and parking arrangements that would overcrowd land or overburden public
facilities and services such as transportation, sewage, drainage, schools, parks, fire or
police protection and other public facilities and services; or
c. Inadequate pedestrian ways.
D. Conditions of Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may place conditions upon approval
of the preliminary plat, in order to ensure that the final plat complies with the requirements of this
UDC and that it reflects principles of good design. Approval of preliminary plats that are
accompanied by pattern books are contingent upon approval of the Pattern Book by the City
Council.

approvals shall continue in force until superseded by an amendment to this UDC, a subsequent,
inconsistent application, or other similar specific action that would alter the approval.
E. Extensions.
1. Upon written request and good cause shown, one extension may be granted by the decisionmaking
body for a period not to exceed the original approval period. No request for an
extension shall be considered unless a written application requesting the extension is

2. Ensuring that highway systems are carefully planned to:

PAGE 320 ARTICLE 15 TITLE; AUTHORITY; JURISDICTION; REFERENCES; AND PURPOSES
v. 7.13.2010
4. Ensuring that the needs of business and industry are recognized by:
a. Providing for sufficient commercial and industrial property to allow for economic
development within the City;
b. Providing for a fair, orderly, and efficient development review process; and
c. Protecting the value of property and buildings;
5. Ensuring that residential areas provide healthful surroundings for family life;
6. Protecting the fiscal and functional integrity of the City by:
a. Ensuring that the growth of the City is commensurate with and promotive of the efficient
and economical use of public funds; and
b. Encouraging development in areas where transportation, water, sewers, schools, parks,
and other public requirements exist; and limit development where such facilities do not
exist; and
7. Preserving, enhancing, and protecting the unique and special character of the City, by:
a. Implementing the City's Comprehensive Plan;
b. Securing adequate light, air, convenience of access, and safety from fire, flood, and other
danger;
c. Fostering a balanced community;

h. Preserving and protecting places and areas of historical, cultural, scenic, or architectural
importance and significance.
B. Specific Purposes. Specific purposes of this UDC may also be set out in individual Articles, Divisions,
or Sections.
Sec. 15.302 Incentives and Flexibility
A. Incentives. The City Council recognizes that setting aside open space on a parcel proposed for
development reduces the buildable area of the parcel. Therefore, this UDC provides incentives for
providing open space. Development options including single-family detached cluster, conservation
subdivision, preservation subdivision, mixed housing neighborhoods, and traditional neighborhood
development are permitted as a matter of right. Within any given district where these development
types are allowed, the general rule is that the more open space that is provided, the greater the
permitted residential density. See Section 2.201, Residential Density, Open Space, and Parcel
Standards.
ARTICLE 15 TITLE; AUTHORITY; JURISDICTION; REFERENCES; AND PURPOSES PAGE 321
v. 7.13.2010
B. Flexibility. The ability to cluster means that the developer can work with the site and plan around
its natural resources. Being freed from a rigid minimum lot size and width standard for single-family
development facilitates open space and resource protection, as smaller lots or different housing
types can be used to provide the open space.

may establish a schedule of fines for violations of this UDC by resolution. Such fines shall not exceed
$1,000 per violation.
C. Community Service Alternative. In lieu of imprisonment as set forth above, the City Judge may
order that the defendant perform community service hours for the city, not to exceed 60 hours.
D. Extraordinary Remedies. In addition to the general penalties available under the City of Zachary
Code of Ordinances, the City may pursue declaratory or injunctive relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent or abate a violation.
E. Restitution and Restoration.
1. Restitution may be sought if violations are not corrected within the time period stated in the
notice of violation, or if the violation results in irreparable harm to the City.
2. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In the event that
restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the City may take
necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid.
F. Holds on Further Permits. No further permits (including certificates of occupancy) will be issued for
development on property that is the subject of an enforcement proceeding, except as necessary to
correct the violation, until the case is resolved, including payment of any assessed fines, restoration
of land, or restitution to the City for funds expended to abate the violation.
G. Permit Suspension and Rescission.
1. Suspension.
a. If the Public Works Director finds that a use or condition presents an immediate threat to
the public health of safety, he or she may suspend a permit (e.g., a limited or conditional
use approval, or a zoning clearance) for a period of up to 30 days, if the suspension of the
use will abate the threat.
b. Upon suspension of a permit, the case shall be referred to the City Council for a hearing on
permanent revocation of the permit. The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the
referral, and the City Council may establish a time frame for compliance and conditions
which must be satisfied for restoration of the permit. The hearing shall be cancelled if the
Public Works Director or designee finds that the violation is cured before the hearing.
ARTICLE 16 ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, AND LEGAL STATUS PAGE 327
v. 7.13.2010
c. The Public Works Director or designee shall enforce the decision of the City Council by
lifting the suspension if the violation is cured according to the Council's order, or revoking
the permit if it is not.
2. Revocation. The City may permanently revoke a permit if:
a. The operator of a use does not remedy a threat to the public health or safety that was the
basis for a permit suspension.
b. The applicant made a material misrepresentation on the application for development
approval or on the record of the decision on the application.
c. The applicant violates conditions of approval and does not cure the violations within the
time periods established by the City pursuant to this Article.
H. Revocation of Surety. In the event that other enforcement remedies listed herein do not cause the
correction of the violation(s), the City Council, acting on the recommendation of the City Building
Inspector or Public Works Director, may initiate a claim upon any bond or surety posted with the
application. The City may seek recovery of any costs associated with the correction of the
violation(s), along with any fines levied and not paid.
Division 16.300 Interpretation
Sec. 16.301 Interpretation, Generally
A. Generally. Interpretations of land uses shall be in accordance with the definitions set out in Article
18, Definitions, and the standards for interpretation set out in Section 1.307, Unlisted or
Functionally Similar Uses. Other interpretations of this UDC shall follow the analytical steps set out
in this section.
B. Provision's Purpose. The purpose of the rule to be interpreted must be determined so that the
protection that it is intended to provide to the public is enforced. The official making the
interpretation should look to the first division of each Article to determine the purpose of the
Article and how the Article is to be applied.
C. Quantifiable or Numeric Standards. If the section to be interpreted has a quantifiable standard, no
interpretation can result in a reduction of the standard. If the number is a maximum, then a higher
numeric value cannot be made. If it is a minimum, then higher numbers may be used. For example
if the maximum density is 3.20 units per acre, then it cannot be interpreted to allow 3.25 units per
acre as-of-right.
D. Qualitative Standards. Non-numeric standards shall be construed in favor of the element being
protected unless there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the alternative language will protect
the public as well as provide the landowner other options.
E. Illustrations. Illustrations are generally provided for explanatory purposes, and do not necessarily
set out all options or alternatives for each standard in this UDC. Where an illustration appears to set
out different substantive requirements than the text of this UDC, the text of this UDC shall control.

Sec. 16.302 Easements, Covenants, and Deed Restrictions
This UDC is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any lawful existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions.
Division 16.400 Legal Status
Sec. 16.401 Severability
A. Generally. If any division, section, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of this UDC is held
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this UDC shall not
be affected. If any application of this UDC to a particular structure, land, or water is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction "as-applied," such judgment shall
not be applicable to any other structure, land, or water not specifically included in said judgment.
B. Signs. With respect to Article 5, Signs, the following severability provisions shall apply:
1. Interpretation; Substitution of Noncommercial Speech for Commercial Speech. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this UDC to the contrary, any sign erected pursuant to the provisions of
this UDC or otherwise lawfully existing with a commercial message may, at the option of the
owner, contain a noncommercial message in lieu of a commercial message. The noncommercial
message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed
from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from one noncommercial message to
another, as frequently as desired by the owner of the sign, provided that:
a. The sign is not a prohibited sign or sign-type,
b. Messages displayed on electronic message center signs comply with the timing and
operational requirements of Section 5.204, Message Centers; and
c. The size, height, setback and other dimensional criteria contained in this UDC have been
satisfied.
2. Severability Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence,
phrase, clause, term, or word of Article 5, Signs, or any other provision of this UDC related to
signage, is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section,
subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of Article 5,
Signs, or this UDC.
3. Severability of Electronic Message Center Provisions. It is the intent of the City Council to limit
the use of electronic message centers as provided in Section 5.204, Message Centers.
Therefore, if any part of Section 5.204, Message Centers, is declared unconstitutional or invalid
by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall operate to sever all provisions related to electronic
message centers, and such signs shall thereafter be prohibited throughout the City.
4. Severability Where Less Speech Results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the
declaration of severability set forth above in subsection B.2., above, or elsewhere in this
Section, this UDC, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph,
ARTICLE 16 ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, AND LEGAL STATUS PAGE 329
v. 7.13.2010
subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of Article 5, Signs, or any other
provision of this UDC related to signage, is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall
not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase,
clause, term, or word of said Article or provision, even if such severability would result in a
situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to
permitting or otherwise.
5. Severability of Provisions Pertaining to Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements. Without diminishing
or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above, if any part, section,
subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of Article 5,
Signs, or any other provision of this UDC related to signage, is declared unconstitutional by the
valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such
unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of Article 5, Signs, that pertains to
prohibited signs or sign elements. It is the intent of the City Council to ensure that as many
prohibited sign types and sign elements as may be constitutionally prohibited continue to be
prohibited.
6. Severability of Provisions if Adjudicated Stricken Due to a Content-Basis. It is the intent of the
City Council to regulate signage in a manner that implements the purposes of this Article 5,
Signs, as expressed therein. The City finds that the purposes stated in Article 5, Signs, are
legitimate, substantial, and compelling public interests, that the regulation of signage provided
by Article 5, Signs, is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and that the incidental
restrictions on expression that may occur as a result of these regulations is no more than is
essential to the furtherance of the public interests. However, if a court of competent
jurisdiction finds any regulation therein to be based upon content and, further, declares such
regulation unconstitutional, then it is the intent of the City Council that only that portion of the
provision that is found to relate to content be severed from this UDC, and if it is not possible for
the court to strike only the portion of the provision that is found to relate to content, then it is
the intent of the City Council that all signs that would be subject to the stricken provision will
instead be subject to the next surviving provision for a sign of like geometry and character that
is more restrictive than the stricken provision in terms of sign area.
Sec. 16.402 Repealer
The following Chapters and Sections of the City of Zachary Code of Ordinances that existed on the
Effective Date prior to the adoption of this UDC are repealed:

A. Generally. In the event that the provisions of this UDC conflict with each other or with other
Sections of the City of Zachary Code of Ordinances:
1. The more restrictive provision shall control, if the provisions were adopted at the same time; or
2. The more recent provision shall control if the provisions were adopted at different times.
B. State and Federal Law. No part of this UDC relieves any applicant from compliance with applicable
provisions of State or Federal law. If a use, structure, operational characteristic, construction
technique, environmental impact, or other matter is prohibited by State or Federal law, it is also
prohibited in the City. Likewise, if a matter is regulated by State or Federal law, then compliance
with State or Federal law does not relieve the applicant from compliance with this UDC, unless the
application of this UDC is legally preempted.

Division 17.100 Purpose and Application of Article
Sec. 17.101 Purpose of Article
The purpose of this Article is to establish the methodologies for the calculations and measurements that
are required by this UDC.
Sec. 17.102 Application of Article
The calculations and measurements of this Article shall be used wherever they are called for in this UDC.
Division 17.200 Calculations
Sec. 17.201 Base Site Area
A. Generally. Base Site Area is used to calculate gross density. See Sec. 17.205, Density.
B. Calculation. Base Site Area equals the total area of the parcel proposed for development (gross site
area), minus the sum of the areas of the following:
1. Land within the planned right-of-way of existing streets or streets that are on the adopted
thoroughfare plan of the City of Zachary.
2. Land that is within major utility rights-of-way that are wider than 50 feet.
3. Land that is cut off from development by railroads, limited access highways, waterbodies, or
wetlands.
4. Land that has previously been set aside as protected open space (e.g., subject to a conservation
easement, plat restriction, or condition of development approval.). See Figure 17.201,
Illustrative Calculation of Base Site Area.

PAGE 332 ARTICLE 17 CALCULATIONS
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 17.202 Net Buildable Area
A. Generally. Net Buildable Area is used to calculate net density. See Sec. 17.205, Density.
B. Calculation. Net buildable area is equal to the lesser of:
1. Base site area (calculated as provided in Section 17.201, Base Site Area) minus areas of open
water (streams are measured to the ordinary mean high water mark) and delineated wetlands
that were not already subtracted from the area of the parcel proposed for development to
calculate the base site area (e.g., wetlands or open water areas that are within previously
dedicated conservation easements, or cut off from development by a limited access highway,
are not subtracted more than once); or
2. The total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of open space required
for the development type in Section 2.201, Residential Density, Open Space, and Parcel
Standards.
Figure 17.202
Illustrative Calculation of Net Buildable Area
Using a 30 percent open space ratio for illustrative purposes, the net buildable area for the left-hand illustration is
calculated as base site area minus areas of open water and delineated wetlands; and the net buildable area for the righthand
illustration is calculated as the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of required open
space.
Sec. 17.203 Open Space Ratio
A. Generally. Open space ratio ("OSR") and Landscape Surface Ratio ("LSR") (see Section 17.204,
Landscape Surface Ratio) are related concepts. OSR applies to residential development, and refers
to commonly owned open space (open space that is not located on private lots). The open space
ratio is not necessarily a measure of "green" open space on a parcel proposed for development, as
it may also refer to areas of open water.
B. Calculation of Requirement. This subsection sets out how to calculate how much commonly-owned
open space is required in a residential development.
1. The amount of commonly-owned open space that is required in a residential development is
calculated as the required OSR (see Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards) times the total
area of the parcel proposed for development.
ARTICLE 17 CALCULATIONS PAGE 333
v. 7.13.2010
2. The required OSR is a minimum requirement. An increased OSR may result if the sum of the
areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements, natural resource protection
requirements, stormwater management requirements, parking lot landscaping requirements,
recreation requirements, and State or Federal environmental laws is greater than the open
space that would be required by application of the minimum OSR.
C. Calculation of Compliance. This subsection sets out how to calculate the OSR of a proposed
development, in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this UDC.
1. The OSR of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of
commonly-owned open space on the parcel by the total area of the parcel. See Figure 17.203,
Illustrative Measurement of Open Space Ratio.
2. Open spaces that qualify for the calculation of OSR include all areas of commonly-owned open
space that are larger than 320 contiguous square feet in area, including but not limited to:
a. Bufferyards (whether required by this Code or not);
b. Areas of protected natural resources;
c. Stormwater management systems (except enclosed systems);
d. Passive recreation areas; and
e. Parking lot landscaping.
3. Open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of OSR include any areas on private,
buildable lots and any commonly-owned open space that is less than 320 contiguous square
feet.

Sec. 17.204 Landscape Surface Ratio
A. Generally. Landscape Surface Ratio ("LSR") and Open Space Ratio ("OSR") (see Section 17.203, Open
Space Ratio) are related concepts. LSR applies to nonresidential development. It refers to
landscaped areas and open spaces that are not to be used for development.
B. Calculation of Requirement. This subsection sets out how to calculate how much landscaped open
space is required in a nonresidential development.
1. The amount of landscaped open space that is required in a nonresidential development is
calculated as the required LSR (see Table 2.204, Nonresidential and Mixed Use Parcel
Standards) times the total area of the parcel proposed for development.
2. The required LSR is a minimum requirement. An increased LSR may result if the sum of the
areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements, natural resource protection
requirements, stormwater management requirements, parking lot landscaping requirements,
and State or Federal environmental laws is greater than the open space that would be required
by application of the minimum LSR.
C. Calculation of Compliance. This subsection sets out how to calculate the LSR of a proposed
development, in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this UDC.
1. The LSR of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of
designated landscaped and open space area on the parcel by the total area of the parcel. See
Figure 17.204, Illustrative Measurement of Landscape Surface Ratio.
2. Open spaces that qualify for the calculation of LSR include all areas of designated landscaped
areas and open space that are larger than 320 contiguous square feet in area, including but not
limited to:
a. Bufferyards (whether required by this Code or not);
b. Areas of protected natural resources;
c. Stormwater management sytems (except enclosed systems);
d. Passive recreation areas; and
e. Parking lot landscaping.
3. Landscaped areas that are less than 320 contiguous square feet in area do not count and
landscaped opn space for the purposes of calculating LSR.

Sec. 17.205 Density
A. Generally.
1. Density is measured in two ways: gross density and net density. The maximum number of units
that are allowed in a residential development shall not exceed the lesser of the results of the
gross density and net density calculations for the parcel proposed for development. Where
density is measured in rooms per acre (e.g., residential eldercare facilities), only sleeping rooms
are counted.
2. The Site Capacity Calculator provided in Appendix A of the electronic version of this UDC allows
a user to input data about a parcel proposed for development and automatically calculate the
number of dwelling units that may be built on the parcel.
B. Gross Density. Gross density is the number of dwelling units (or rooms, where so specified) per acre
of base site area (see Section 17.201, Base Site Area). An example calculation is provided in Figure
17.205, Illustrative Density Calculations.
C. Net Density. Net density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units (or rooms, where so
specified) by the net buildable area of the parcel proposed for development. An example
calculation is provided in Figure 17.205, Illustrative Density Calculations.
PAGE 336 ARTICLE 17 CALCULATIONS
v. 7.13.2010
Figure 17.205A
Illustrative Density Calculations
EXAMPLE: 28 Homes are planned for an 11 acre parcel.
GROSS DENSITY
The parcel proposed for development is 11 acres. 2.5 acres (including forest and open water) were previously dedicated as a conservation
easement, and 0.2 acres within planned right-of-way of abutting street. There are no areas within major utility corridors or cut off from
development. Therefore, the Base Site Area is 11 - 2.5 - 0.2, or 8.3 acres. 28 homes divided by 8.3 acres equals a gross density of
approximately 3.38 units per acre.
NET DENSITY
The required Open Space Ratio in this example is 50 percent. Therefore, the Net Buildable Area is the lesser of 50 percent times 11 acres (5.5
acres) or the Base Site Area minus open water and wetlands. Since the open water area was counted in the Base Site Area calculation
(because it is subject to a conservation easement), it is not subtracted again. Accordingly, the Net Buildable Area is 5.5 acres (because 5.5
acres is less than 8.3 acres). The net density is 28 homes divided by 5.5 acres, or 5.10 units per acre.
Sec. 17.206 Floor Area Ratio
A. Generally. The unit of measurement for intensity is called Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
B. Calculation.
1. For individual lots, FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area on the lot by the lot area.
2. For parcels proposed for development, gross FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area
on the parcel proposed for development by the base site area. See Figure 17.206, Illustrative
Floor Area Ratio Calculation.
C. Structured Parking Exception. The floor area of structured parking facilities is not included in the
calculation of FAR.

A. Building Coverage. Building coverage is the total of areas taken on a horizontal plane at the main
grade level of the principal building and all accessory buildings, exclusive of uncovered porches,
terraces, and steps. All dimensions are measured between the exterior faces of walls.
B. Building Coverage Ratio. Building coverage ratio is building coverage divided by lot area. See Figure

Division 17.300 Measurements
Sec. 17.301 Open Space
The following qualify as open space for the purposes of this UDC:
1. Outdoor Recreation Areas. All forms of outdoor recreation areas will count toward the required
open space, from passive areas and nature reserves to ball fields, tennis courts, swimming
pools, and golf courses. There are limitations on the development of some of these.
2. Stormwater Facilities. Open air stormwater facilities count as open space. It is desirable that
stormwater be treated and routed into natural drainage areas rather than piped in storm
sewers for significant distances. These facilities may be permitted in floodplains even though
they are protected from being part of the developed portion of the site.
3. Bufferyards. The required bufferyards are counted as open space.
4. Required Landscape Areas. Required landscape areas, such as parking lot landscaping areas, are
counted as open space. However, landscaping of private lots in residential subdivisions is not
counted as open space.
5. Agriculture. Agriculture counts as an open space in cluster, planned, or conservation cluster
development options when it is part of the development plan.
6. Resource Protection Areas. All areas that are protected for natural resource value are counted
as open space.
Sec. 17.302 Lot Width
A. Generally. Lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front
setback line. See Figure 17.302A, Calculation of Lot Width; Standard Lots.
ARTICLE 17 CALCULATIONS PAGE 339
v. 7.13.2010
Figure 17.302A
Measurement of Lot Width; Standard Lots
B. Corner Lots. Lot width (for regulatory purposes) is the distance from the interior side lot line to the
side street lot line, measured at the front building line, minus the difference between the street
yard setback and the side yard setback. See Figure 17.302B, Calculation of Lot Width; Corner Lots.
Figure 17.302B
Measurement of Lot Width; Corner Lots
B. Irregular Lots. Lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the
front building line. See Figure 17.302C, Calculation of Lot Width; Irregular Lots. Generally, the front
building line is the front setback line. However, an alternative front building line may be established
on the plat of a subdivision that is more distant than the front setback line from the front lot line.
Lot width must be maintained to a depth that is sufficient to accommodate a reasonable building in
the context of adjacent and nearby lots.

Measurement of Lot Width; Irregular Lots
Sec. 17.303 Setbacks
A. Generally. Setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot, as follows:
1. Front setbacks are measured from the front lot line. The front lot line is the lot line that abuts
the right-of-way from which the lot takes its address.
2. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear lot line. The rear lot line is the lot line that is
opposite from the front lot line.
3. Side setbacks are measured from side lot lines. Side lot lines are lot lines that intersect with
front lot lines.
B. Flag Lots. On flag lots, setbacks are measured as provided in subsection A., above, except that the
front setback line is measured from the "shared lot line." See Figure 17.303, Setback Measurement.

Setback Measurement
ARTICLE 17 CALCULATIONS PAGE 341
v. 7.13.2010
Sec. 17.304 Height
A. Buildings. Building height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished
grade along the front building line to:
1. The highest peak or ridge line of the roof for pitched roof styles; or
2. The top of the parapet for flat roof styles
B. Other Structures. Structure height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average
finished grade around the base of the structure to the highest point on the structure. This
measurement applies to:
1. Structures without roofs (e.g., fences); and
2. Amateur radio antennae, whether mounted on a roof, the ground, or another structure.
C. Specialized Structures and Building Appurtenances.
1. Specialized structures and building appurtenances are not counted in the calculation of building
height, provided that:
a. They project not more than:
i. 15 feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are two stories in
height or higher; or
ii. Seven feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are less than two
stories in height.
b. They occupy not more than ten percent of the total roof area of the building; and
c. They are not used for human habitation, commercial, or industrial purposes, except as
incidental to the operation of the building.
2. For the purposes of this subsection, "specialized structures and building appurtenances"
means:
a. Roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, or similar equipment
required to operate and maintain the building;
b. Architectural towers, steeples, flagpoles, ventilating fans, chimneys, smokestacks (except
as provided in subsection D., below);
c. Skylights, photovoltaic (solar-electric) panels, and solar water heaters; and
d. Satellite dishes and antennae that are regulated by Section 2.506, Antennae and Satellite
Dishes.
D. Smokestacks. Smokestacks shall be permitted to a height of 90 feet in the I district. In other
districts, they are subject to subsection C., above.

D
Day-Night Level (DNL) means a sound measurement scale that measures noise exposure over a 24-hour
period. The scale accounts for nighttime noise levels by imposing a 10 a-weighted decibel (dBA) penalty

nighttime event is considered equal to 10 daytime events at the same level). The scale also accounts for
various weather patterns that may affect noise levels. Generally speaking, this measurement scale

CALCULATOR
Example Residential Site Capacity Analysis
A. Sample Parcel Characteristics. The example in the table below makes the following assumptions:
1. Area of parcel proposed for development: 100 acres
2. Land within ultimate rights-of-way: 2.0 acres
3. No areas of open water, delineated wetlands, major utility easements, existing conservation
easements, or cut off from development
4. Zoning: Suburban Residential (RS)
5. Proposed Use: Conservation Subdivision
6. Open Space Ratio: 30 percent (from Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards)
7. Gross Density: 2.46 u/a (from Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards)
8. Net Density: 3.51 u/a (from Table 2.201, Residential Parcel Standards)
B. Calculation. The table below shows the site capacity calculation based on the data set out above:
Example of a Residential Site Capacity Calculation
Step 1 Enter Gross Site Area of the parcel proposed for development
(as determined by actual survey). 100.00 ac.
Subtract land within existing streets' ultimate rights-of-way. -2.0 ac.
Subtract land cut off from use by railroad, highway, or water body. - ac.
Subtract land within major utilities' rights-of-way (minimum 50-foot width for entire R.O.W.). - ac.
Subtract land previously dedicated as open space (conservation easements). - ac.
Equals Base Site Area. = 98.0 ac.
Step 2 Enter Base Site Area (Step 1). 98.0 ac.
Multiply by Gross Density for use and district from Table 3.201A. 2.46 u/a
Equals District Yield (round down to whole number). 241 units
Step 3 Enter Gross Site Area (Step 1). 100 ac.
Multiply by Open Space Ratio for use and district, Table 3.201A. 30%
Equals District Open Space. 30 ac.
Step 4 Enter Base Site Area (Step 1). 98.0 ac.
Subtract the greater of:
District Open Space (Step 3); or
Areas that were not subtracted from gross site area in Step 1 that are covered by open water and areas
covered by delineated wetlands.
30 ac.
(District
Open Space)
Equals Net Buildable Area. 70 ac.
Times Net Density for use and district (Table 3.201A). 3.51 u/a
Equals Site Specific Yield (round down to whole number). 245 units
Step 5 Select District Yield (Step 5) or Site Specific Yield (Step 7), whichever is less. 241 units
