PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of the City of Maryland Heights, Missouri of a general and permanent nature. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 1 is 1-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-1 and 2-2 is de sired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-1.1, 2-1.2 and 2-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 15 and 16, it will be designated as Chapter 15.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

BONDED FIBER MATRIX 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
A bonded fiber matrix (BFM) is a hydraulically applied continuous layer of elongated fiber strands held together by a water resistant bonding agent designed to protect exposed soil by eliminating direct impact of precipitation. BFMs adhere directly to the surface of the soil, eliminating gaps between the product and the soil; therefore no special treatment is required at the upstream end of the BFM. BFMs have a high water-holding capacity, but do not form a water-insensitive crust that would inhibit plant growth. BFMs biodegrade completely into material known beneficial to plant growth. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Typically installed on slopes where erosion control blankets are impractical and other mulching methods are inadequate. 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
Type of Flow: Sheet flow only 
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Immediately after completion of a phase of grading 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: 
Follow manufacturer's recommendations to maximize usefulness 
O&M PROCEDURES: 
? Inspect at least every two weeks and after every storm until vegetation is fully established 
? Repair eroded areas and reapply product and vegetation 
SITE CONDITIONS FOR REMOVAL: 
Typically left in place to degrade naturally 
TYPICAL DETAILS: 
Not Applicable 
DUST CONTROL 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
Control measures designed to reduce the transport of dust, thereby preventing pollutants from infiltrating into stormwater. Examples for construction activities include vegetative cover, wind barriers, minimization of soil disturbance, spray on adhesives, tilling, chemical treatment and water sprays. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Critical in areas of exposed soil. 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
A combination of the following actions should be used to help reduce the dust and air pollution at a construction site. 
Minimize Concurrent Areas of Soil Disturbance - Phase work to the extent practical 
Vegetative Cover - For areas not subjected to traffic, vegetation provides the most practical method of dust control and should be established as early as possible. Temporary vegetation should also be used. See Seeding and Sodding BMPs for additional information. 
Sprinkling - The site can be sprinkled with water until the surface is moist. This practice is effective for dust control on large areas, haul routes or other traffic routes, but constant repetition is required for effective control. 
Tilling - Roughen the surface and bring clods to the surface. This is an emergency measure that should be used before soil blowing starts. Begin tillage on windward side of the site. Chisel plows with shanks spaced about 12 inches to 18 inches apart and spring toothed harrows are examples of equipment that may produce the desired effect. See Surface Roughening BMP for additional information. 
Wind Barriers - Solid board fences, snow fences, burlap fences, crate walls and similar materials can be used to control air currents and blowing soil. Barriers placed at right angles to prevailing wing currents at intervals of about 10 times their height are effective in controlling soil blowing. 
Street Cleaning - Paved areas that have soil on them from construction sites should be cleaned continuously, at least daily, utilizing a street sweeper or bucket type endloader or scraper. 
Mulching - This practice offers a fast and effective means of controlling dust when properly applied. Binders and tackifiers should be used on organic mulches. Mulching is not recommended for areas with heavy traffic. See Mulching BMP for additional information. 
NOTE: If calcium chloride or spray-on adhesives are used for dust control, a permit may be required from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. 
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Routinely, especially in advance of and during periods of dry weather 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: See Conditions for Effective Use above 
O&M PROCEDURES: 
Inspect daily and renew as needed 
SITE CONDITIONS FOR REMOVAL: 
Maintain practices until all disturbed areas are vegetated or paved and blowing soil is no longer a concern. 
TYPICAL DETAILS:

STREAMBANK PROTECTION 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
A vegetative, structural or combination treatment of streams designed to stabilize the stream and reduce erosion. It is important to note that a systemic analysis of the entire reach of stream must be conducted in order to avoid unintended negative impacts on a stream as a result of a corrective action at an isolated location. A wide array of products and methodologies can be used to stabilize streams: live stakes; cellular confinement matrices; articulated block pavers; rip rap; gabion baskets; turf reinforcement mats; fabric formed revetments; cedar tree revetments; straw wattles; grade control structures; stilling basins; etc. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Open channels downstream from developed areas. 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
Acceptable methods vary widely due to the unique nature of each reach of channel. Design considerations include: current and future watershed conditions; discharge; velocity; sediment load; channel slope; control of bottom scour (incising); soil conditions; compatibility with other improvements; changes in channel alignment; and protection and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitats and existing tree canopy. 
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Well in advance of disturbing any upstream areas in order to give plant material a relatively long period to become established and allow ample time for inspection and necessary repairs during construction of the remainder of the development. 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: 
Procedures are specific to materials used. General construction principles include: 
? Stabilize the channel bottom first to prevent incising and knick points from undermining the bank protection 
? Start and stop bank protection at stable points along the channel 
? Minimize the size of all disturbed areas and stabilize as soon as each phase of construction is complete 
? Use other BMPs to prevent runoff from disturbing the streambank protection area until it has been completed 
? Store all construction materials well away from the stream 
? At the end of each workday, move all construction equipment out of and away from the stream to prevent flooding 
? Avoid steep slopes on the streambank 
? Fence the construction area and post warning signs if trespassing or vandalism is likely 
O&M PROCEDURES: 
? Inspect at least every two weeks and after every storm during construction; and once each season thereafter 
? Repair, relocate, or add BMPs protecting channel until the streambank protection is operational 
? Remove sediment as needed for proper establishment of protection measures 
? Repair gaps in vegetative cover by replacing plants or designing alternative methods/materials 
? Repair structural systems as needed

TEMPORARY STREAM CROSSING 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
A stabilized stream crossing designed to protect the stream banks while facilitating access for construction vehicles and equipment. Use of temporary stream crossings is discouraged - crossings are a direct source of pollution and should be avoided if alternatives are feasible. If the work involves construction below the normal water of a defined channel, a permit will need to be obtained from the US Army Corps of Engineers prior to the City approving the SWPPP. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
At locations where work and disruption in creek can be minimized 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
When no other feasible alternative exists, crossing streams may be permitted. Design considerations include: current and proposed watershed conditions; average and peak discharge (2 year, 24 hour storm); effect on water surface elevation offsite; velocity; sediment removal; and protection of fish and wildlife habits and existing trees. Criteria for certain types of crossings follow. 
Low Water Crossing - Any constant flow less than 3" deep; light traffic; bank height less than 5 feet; perpendicular to flow or with slight upstream arc 
Culvert - Sized for 2 year, 24 hour storm with 1 foot freeboard and no flooding of offsite areas; pipe parallel to flow; embankment perpendicular to channel or with slight upstream arc; rip rap on exposed faces sized for overtopping during a peak storm period 
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
During dry periods in advance of need to cross stream. 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: 
Procedures are specific to type of crossing used. Procedures for low water crossings and culverts include: 
? Ensure that all necessary materials are on site before beginning work 
? Provide a stable means to bypass normal channel flow prior to disturbing channel 
? Scarify and stabilize channel bottom to provide even foundation for crossing 
? Install culvert, if needed - place clayey soil to required dimensions around pipe

NONSEDIMENT POLLUTION CONTROL 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
Control measures designed to prohibit chemicals, hazardous materials, solid waste and construction debris from polluting stormwater. Pollutants carried in solution or as surface films on runoff will be carried through most erosion control and sediment capture BMPs. Keeping substances like fuel, oil, asphalt, paint, solvents, fertilizer, soil additives, concrete wash water, solid waste and construction debris from polluting runoff can be accomplished to a large extent through good housekeeping on the site and following the manufacturer's recommendations for disposal. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Collection, storage and fueling areas should be located onsite in an area that does not receive a substantial amount of runoff from upland areas and does not drain directly to lakes, creeks, streams, rivers, sewers, groundwater, wetlands, or road ditches. 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
? Reduction in pollutants depends heavily on how construction personnel perform their duties. An effective management system requires training and signage to promote proper storage, handling and disposal of materials. Follow up observations of actions and inspection of storage areas by management personnel is also required. 
? Plans should contain notes clearly stating requirements for addressing potential pollutants 
? Fueling areas and storage areas for hazardous materials should be protected by berms or other means of catching leaks or spills 
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Immediately following installation of construction entrance and wash station 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: 
? Place waste receptacles near area of work 
? Construct protective berm or other devices around fueling and hazardous materials storage areas

GRASS LINED CHANNEL 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
Trapezoidal or parabolic stormwater conveyance channel lined with vegetation, designed to direct runoff and reduce the flow velocity of concentrated runoff. Channels should outlet into sediment traps, detention/retention basins, or other stable outlets. In areas with seasonally high water tables or seepage problems, subsurface drains are included under the channel. Grassed channels have a limited ability to control runoff from large storms and are often used in combination with other BMPs, such as subsurface drains and riprap stabilization. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Used in areas where erosion-resistant conveyances are needed, including areas with highly erodible soils and moderately steep channel slopes - less than 5%. Channels should only be installed where space is available for a relatively large cross section. Channels should not make sharp, unnatural changes in direction or grade of flow. 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
Type of Flow: Concentrated flow Flow Properties: Maximum velocity of 5 fps  
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Immediately after clearing, prior to upstream grading activities.

SURFACE ROUGHENING 
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 
Continuous horizontal grooves on the surface of slopes designed to reduce runoff velocity, increase infiltration, reduce erosion and trap sediment. Roughening can also be used when other methods of erosion/siltation control are not immediately available. In this case surface roughening should be supplemented with other BMPs as soon as possible. 
WHERE BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
At the top of, and at intermediate points along, disturbed slopes to disrupt low-volume, concentrated flows, and/or at the base of disturbed slopes to slow water runoff and capture sediment laden runoff 
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF BMP: 
Type of Flow: Sheet flow Contributing Area: Unlimited on slopes ;lt; 10% Slopes ;gt; 10% require additional BMPs (such as diversion channel)  
WHEN BMP IS TO BE INSTALLED: 
Immediately after rough grading; prior to seeding or mulching. 
INSTALLATION/CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES: 
? Using light weight machinery, such as tractors with a harrow, disk or box grader attachment, drag surface to create series of grooves and ridges perpendicular to water flow.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SWPPP INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS 
Without inspection and maintenance of siltation/erosion control measures, erosion and siltation control measures will not remain effective for long periods of time. Without proper training of inspection staff and effective records of results of inspections, it is difficult to determine what maintenance is required. 
The inspector needs to fully understand the SWPPP. The SWPPP is more than just words and symbols on a piece of paper; it is a blueprint for contractors to follow. The inspector must know the implementation schedules, know where and when BMPs are to be installed, know what BMPs are to be maintained or eliminated, and fully understand the limitations of BMPs. 
The contractor needs to be informed by the inspector of any noncompliance or violation issues. It is recommended that the inspector meet at least weekly with the contractor(s) to avoid problems that might lead to noncompliance issues. Also, the inspector must be cognizant of his/her responsibilities relative identifying where identifying where modifications to the SWPPP are needed and recognize when it is necessary to involve owners, designers and regulatory personnel in modifications to the SWPPP or concerns about the operation of the SWPPP. Open and regular communication with all companies and agencies is essential. 
The inspector also needs to be aware of appropriate contacts regarding maintenance of BMPs or other concerns. At some points of the project, the developer's land development personnel may be the sole contact; at other stages of construction, it may necessary to communicate with personnel responsible for building construction. 
General inspection guidelines follow to provide some additional guidance to the inspector. These guidelines are provided as a tool for the inspector's use and do not attempt to address all items that can be included on a specific SWPPP. The importance of reporting the results of the inspections and follow up with appropriate personnel cannot be stressed enough. 
GENERAL SWPPP INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS 
The inspector is responsible for: 
Inspecting the site to ensure proper installation, operation and maintenance of BMPs; 
Performing inspections weekly and within 24 hours of rainfall in excess of 0.25 inches; 
Determining the overall effectiveness of the SWPPP; 
Determining the need for additional control measures; 
Promptly notifying the permittee and the site contractors responsible for operation and maintenance of BMPs or the deficiencies found during an inspection.; 
Notifying the permittee, site contractors and the City immediately of any situation requiring immediate action; 
Noting corrective actions taken; 
Forwarding report of inspections to the Department within 5 days of inspection. 
The inspector should have detailed knowledge about the site specific SWPPP, particularly: 
The location and type of control measures; 
The construction requirements for the control measures; 
Spill prevention and cleanup measures; 
Inspection and maintenance record keeping requirements. 
The inspector should determine the following from the inspection: 
The effectiveness of each BMP; 
The maintenance that needs to be performed on the BMP; 
The need for revisions to the SWPPP. 
GENERAL ITEMS TO INSPECT 
BMPs installed in timely fashion 
BMPs installed/performing correctly 
Any damage to BMP as noted 
Has maintenance been performed 
Is the BMP still effective

(Ord. No. 99-1664,  1-6, 11-18-99) 
Sec. 6-332. - Sewer lateral repair program. 
(a)  Established. There is hereby established a sewer lateral repair program. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Defective sewer lateral: That portion of the sanitary sewage system that is unable to carry household wastes to the MSD sewer main because of a collapse or displacement of the pipe structure. 
    Rodding: The mechanism used by a plumber to place inside a sewer pipe to remove or open the blockage of a sewer lateral. 
    Sewer lateral: That portion of the sanitary sewage system that carries household wastes to a Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District (MSD) sewer main and that lies between the structure foundation wall, or exterior wall, and the main in the street or sewer easement. It does not include that part of the system located under any part of a building. A sewer lateral may be located in a front, side or rear yard. 
    Trench depth: The distance from the top elevation of the existing ground along the centerline of the trench to the flowline of the sewer lateral. 
(c)  Procedure. 
(1)  If the owner of an eligible dwelling unit experiences a blockage of his sewer lateral, he must first have the line rodded at his own expense. Since clogging is common and cleaning is a home maintenance expense, this cost is not reimbursable by the city. If the problem is not resolved by rodding of the sewer lateral, the property owner will contact the city during normal working hours to file a claim. The claim form must include a copy of a verification letter from the firm hired to do the rodding stating the sewer lateral is defective and cannot be cleaned by rodding. The claim form must include a copy of the paid real estate tax bill for this property. 
(2)  The public works director will review the claim to determine if a television inspection will be required of the sewer lateral. 
(3)  The property owner must sign a hold harmless release form from the city prior to a city contractor doing any videotaping or repairing of the sewer lateral. 
(4)  The television inspection contractor will provide a videotape and written report of the sewer lateral. The contractor will mark the problem location along the sewer lateral. 
(5)  If it is determined from the television inspection that the sewer lateral is defective, the city's contractor will perform the necessary corrective work. The contractor must obtain all necessary permits from the city and St. Louis County to perform the work in compliance with applicable codes. 
(6)  The city will stipulate the amount of work the contractor is authorized to perform under the repair program. The work will be based on a unit price contract that includes the excavation, repair and/or replacement of the defective portion of the sewer lateral, backfill, removal of all debris and sodding of the disturbed portion of the yard. 
(d)  Selection of city contractor. 
(1)  The city contractor will be approved by the city council. The city will solicit bids on a two-year basis for the necessary corrective work from a licensed drain layer or plumbing contractor with a current drain layer's license issued by St. Louis County. The contract will be renewed at the end of the first year with the understanding that funds will not be guaranteed for the second year until approval by city council. The contractor will provide the city with a certificate of insurance in the minimum amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) and a performance bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) annually for the corrective work. The contractor shall pay the prevailing wage rates for each craft or type of workman needed for the sewer lateral repair. 
(2)  The corrective work that is subject to payment from the sewer lateral fund will include the excavation, repair and/or replacement of the defective portion of the sewer lateral, backfill, removal and all debris and sodding of the disturbed portion of the yard. Additional landscaping or landscape restoration work will be done at the property owner's expense. 
(3)  It will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or replace sidewalks, driveways, and streets damaged or removed in order to accomplish the repair. These costs will be covered by the program. In the event that accessory structure[s] such as fences, sheds, garages, etc. are in the path of the sewer lateral and lie over the damaged portion of the sewer lateral, the city reserves the right to reroute the sewer lateral, or to require the property owner to move any accessory structures, at the property owner's expense. The contractor shall protect the underground sprinkler systems, trees, and any other underground facilities of the resident or property owner from damage during the sewer lateral repair. 
(4)  The department of public works for both St. Louis County and the city will be responsible for the inspection of work. The city will verify the trench depth and the length of the sewer lateral. 
(5)  Upon completion of the corrective work, the contractor will file with the department of public works a written statement with a lien waiver that the work has been completed along with the final quantities. The city will pay for the invoiced work within thirty (30) days. 
(e)  Authorization to contract work. The city administrator is hereby authorized to approve the repairs of a damaged sewer lateral by the city's contractor for an amount not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per damaged sewer lateral. 
(f)  Exclusions. 
(1)  If the repair of a defective sewer lateral exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), the property owner will be responsible for fifty (50) percent of all costs for the amount exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). 
(2)  Any services contracted by a resident or property owner for work inside the walls of a dwelling unit are a separate matter not covered by this program. Any services contracted by a resident or property owner outside of the scope of this policy are not the responsibility of the city and will not be subject to payment by the city. 
(Ord. No. 99-1675,  1-6, 12-16-99) 
Sec. 6-333. - Fees for sewer lateral program. 
(a)  The city does hereby impose a fee of twenty-eight dollars ($28.00) per year on all residential property having six (6) or fewer dwelling units for the purpose of providing funds for the sewer lateral program. 
(b)  The mayor is authorized to enter into an agreement with St. Louis County Collector of Revenue for the collection of the city's sewer lateral fees. 
(Ord. No. 99-1676,  1, 2, 12-16-99)

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following facts will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 10-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 77.260 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council of the City of Maryland Heights, Missouri ordains as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2014-3959,  1, 12-18-14) 
Secs. 10-2-10-9. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 10-10. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Maryland Heights, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one (1) percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for St. Louis County dated February 4, 2015 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 2014-3959,  1, 12-18-14) 
Sec. 10-11. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection 10-10(a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

Sec. 10-44. - Floodway. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-20 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(2)  The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  If subsection 10-40(b) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(4)  In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in subsection 10-40(b). 
(Ord. No. 2014-3959,  1, 12-18-14) 
Sec. 10-45. - Recreational vehicles. 
(a)  Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AO, AE, and AH zones on the community's FIRM either: 
(1)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
(2)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use [2]; or 
(3)  Meet the permitting, elevation, and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this article.

Sec. 10-53. - Floodplain management variance criteria. 
    In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges.

(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (0.5) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (b) through (f) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (0.5) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.

(Ord. No. 94-812,  1(1.05), 2-3-94) 
Sec. 12-56. - Review. 
(a)  If the grievance has not been resolved by the designated coordinator to the satisfaction of the complainant, the complainant may submit a copy of the grievance form and the designated coordinator's response to the city administrator for final review. The complainant shall submit these documents to the administrator together with a short written statement explaining the reason(s) for dissatisfaction with the designated coordinator's written response, within five (5) business days after the complainant's receipt of the designated coordinator's response. The city administrator will extend the period for submitting the review request and supporting documents for up to ten (10) additional business days upon complainant's request.

The city administrator's decision shall be final. If the administrator disapproves or modifies the commission's recommendations, the administrator shall include written reasons for such disapproval or modification. 
(f)  A complainant's failure to appeal the designated coordinator's response for review by the city administrator within the specified time limits shall mean that the complainant has withdrawn the grievance or has accepted the last response given by the designated coordinator. 
(Ord. No. 94-812,  1(1.06), 2-3-94) 
Sec. 12-57. - Accessibility. 
    The city shall insure that all stages of the grievance procedure are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 
(Ord. No. 94-812,  1(1.07), 2-3-94) 
Sec. 12-58. - Case-by-case resolution. 
    Each grievance involves a unique set of factors which include but are not limited to: the specific nature of the disability; the essential eligibility requirements for, the benefits to be derived from, and the nature of the program, service, or activity at issue; the health and safety of others; and whether or not an accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration to the program, service, or activity or undue hardship to the city. Accordingly, termination of a grievance at any level, whether through the granting of relief or otherwise, shall not constitute a precedent on which any other complainants should rely.

(c)  Anything herein or hereafter notwithstanding, the city clerk may recommend to the city council the suspension of, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, without prior warning, notice or hearing, any license issued under this article during the term of such license, for the failure of any licensee to comply with any provisions of this article, a statute of the state or the license relating to the business, occupation or activity for which such license was issued if, in the judgment of the city clerk, such failure constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health or safety.

The register shall include the full name of the person, their home or business address, driver's license number, a complete description of their vehicle, including the license plate number of the vehicle and the state issuing the license plate.

(b)  Any police officer or authorized representative may request to inspect the registry by asking the licensee's consent to inspect the register for the purposes of public safety. If the inspection is refused, the police officer or an authorized representative may seek entry by obtaining an administrative subpoena issued by the city clerk. If inspection is refused, the licensee must secure the register in the presence of the officer or authorized representative in a manner directed by the officer or authorized representative to ensure that no one can tamper with the register and maintain the security of the register in the presence of the officer or authorized representative until such as an administrative subpoena has been issued by the city clerk. Any subsequent inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the administrative subpoena. 
(c)  Refusal of the licensee to produce the registry for inspection upon receipt of an administrative subpoena shall be considered grounds for revocation or suspension the operator's business license under section 13-32.

Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs, which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a streetlight or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or sign. 
(4)  Dead or diseased tree removal on private property.

(9)  Tree removal/trimming permit requirement. A citizen may express a "concern complaint" about a public owned tree located near their property. The city will make a written determination concerning the status of the tree. If the citizen does not agree with the determination they may request a permit to remove the tree at their own expense. Whenever a tree is removed, the tree shall be replaced with a tree approved by the city. The expense of the replacement tree shall be the responsibility of the person removing the tree. The permit fee for the removal of the tree will be the cost of the new tree. The city will then be responsible for the planting of the new tree. 
(10)  Penalty. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be, upon conviction or a plea of guilty, subject to a fine in accordance with the Maryland Heights Municipal Code-General Provisions section 1-13-general penalty, continuing violations.

Sec. 25-11.14. - "OD-C" Overlay District-Corridor. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the Overlay District is primarily to address the stated goal of the comprehensive plan to promote improvements to all aspects of property development and redevelopment within the city's commercial corridors. More particularly, the district establishes additional development regulations that are applied in conjunction with those established by the underlying zoning districts. In so doing, it is intended that future development will advance a retail, office and service commercial use pattern characterized by pedestrian or customer oriented design and the use of more sophisticated architectural finishes than was typified by the warehouses and storage yards of the heavy commercial and light industrial uses built during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. 
B.  District definition. The Overlay District includes all parcels that lie, in whole or in part, within three hundred (300) feet of the centerline of Dorsett Road between the Lindbergh Boulevard right-of-way on the east and the Interstate 270 right-of-way on the west. The requirements of this district shall not be applied to any single family detached houses being utilized as dwelling units. 
C.  Applicability. The standards and requirements of the Overlay District shall have preeminence over all underlying zoning districts, except where explicitly described within a conditional use permit or planned district ordinance. In the case of legally pre-existing non-conforming uses or structures, the applicability of this section shall be governed by article 7 of this chapter. 
Where the standards of the Overlay District and the underlying zoning district appear to be in conflict, the more restrictive standard shall be applied. Where such determination is not clear, the city planner shall apply the standard that best meets the goals and strategies of the comprehensive plan. 
D.  Administration. The listing of affected projects and the timing of review of the applicable standards is as follows: 
1.  Projects subject to overlay district standards. The standards of the Dorsett Road Overlay District shall be met by any of the following multi-family residential, office, commercial, and industrial projects:

b.  Any expansion of an existing building by more than one thousand (1,000) square feet. 
c.  Any remodeling of an existing use that alters at least seventy-five (75) percent of the floor area or site area. 
d.  Any remodeling or improvement with a value greater than fifty (50) of the existing county department of revenue total appraised valuation. This shall not include approved conditional use permits or planned districts already subject to design or architectural review in their approval ordinance. 
e.  Any remodeling or improvement of any commercial or industrial building or site which has been vacant for one (1) year or more and that requires a building permit. 
2.  Application and approval process. 
a.  Required materials. For any project subject to the requirements of the Overlay District, conformance with the standards and requirements of this section shall be demonstrated by submitting the following information, exhibits and/or materials: 
i.  An appropriate site plan review, building permit, or special zoning application form, as described elsewhere in this chapter.

H.  When the occupancy load of a building used for public assembly (i.e., nightclubs, restaurants, etc.) exceeds the available number of parking spaces, there shall be a corresponding reduction in the maximum occupancy of the building. A ratio of two and one-half (2.5) persons per parking stall shall be used to calculate the reduction in occupancy. 
I.  Except as otherwise provided, the number of employees shall be compiled on the basis of maximum number of persons employed on the premises at one time on an average day or night, whichever is greater. Seasonal variations in employment may be recognized and used by the city planner.

Sec. 25-15.1. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this section to regulate and control the location, number, design, installation and maintenance of signs and matters relating thereto within the city in order to promote the public safety, health, and general welfare of the community. 
(Ord. No. 2013-3792,  3, 9-5-13) 
Sec. 25-15.2. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this section to: 
A.  Provide for uniform regulation and orderly development of signs. 
B.  Provide a desirable and attractive living environment through harmonious and uniform signage. 
C.  Accommodate the identification and communication needs of businesses and other organizations. 
D.  Enable the public to easily locate goods, services, and facilities in the city. 
E.  Acknowledge the diverse needs businesses and organizations have for signage with rules adaptable to varying circumstances. 
F.  Permit artistic freedom while controlling the adverse impacts of excessively obtrusive signage. 
G.  Neither directly nor indirectly regulate the message content of signs but only the time, place, and manner of their display. 
H.  Establish standards that are designed to ensure that signs conform to the character of development established in the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 2013-3792,  3, 9-5-13) 
Sec. 25-15.3. - Overall design goals. 
    Signs shall meet the following design goals: 
A.  Signs shall legibly convey their messages without being distracting or unsafe to motorists reading them. 
B.  Signs shall be designed not to compete with one another, but to contribute to the convenience of the public and the attractiveness of the streetscape. 
C.  Signs shall be an integral architectural element of the buildings and sites that they identify. 
D.  Signs shall be consistent with, and not detract from, the overall character of the buildings and sites that they identify. 
E.  Signs shall be carefully crafted, durable, and consistent with the quality and permanence of the buildings and sites that they identify.

APPENDIX B. - LAND USE AND REQUIRED PARKING MATRIX 
The terminology used in this appendix is based on the coding and classification of land use contained in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), prepared by the Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service in 2012. The coding and classification system has been modified in certain instances to clarify terminology. 
North American Industry Classification System contains additional descriptive information that could be helpful in the interpretation of a particular use and should be used as a reference document to support these regulations. A copy of this manual is available for review in the Department of Community Development and on the NAICS website.
