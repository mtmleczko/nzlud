PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Muskegon Heights, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented through March 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Brenda Blair, Editor, and MaLinda Allen, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Sharon Gibbs, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Code 1965, § 1.13)

(Code 1965, § 1.11) 
Sec. 1-11. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
Sec. 1-12. - Appearance tickets. 
(a)  Persons authorized to issue and serve. Police officers, health officers, inspectors and all other enforcement officials of the city are hereby authorized to issue to and serve appearance tickets upon persons for the violation of any ordinance of the city. An appearance ticket is a written notice issued and subscribed by such officer directing a designated person to appear in the district court at a designated future time in connection with his alleged commission of a designated offense. 
(b)  Complaint. The officer who has issued and served an appearance ticket, at or before the time the appearance ticket is returnable, shall file or cause to be filed in the district court a complaint charging the person named in the appearance ticket with the offense specified therein. If the complaint is not sufficient on its face, and if the court is satisfied that a complaint sufficient on its face cannot be drawn and filed on the basis of the available facts or evidence, it shall dismiss the complaint. 
(c)  Failure to appear. If after the service of an appearance ticket and the filing of a complaint for the offense designated therein the defendant does not appear in the district court at the time the appearance ticket is returnable, the court may issue a summons or a warrant of arrest based upon the complaint filed. 
(Code 1965, §§ 9.201-9.203) 
Sec. 1-13. - General penalties and sanctions. 
(a)  Unless a violation of this Code or any ordinance of the city is specifically designated in the Code or ordinance as a municipal civil infraction, the violation shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor. 
(b)  The penalty for a misdemeanor violation shall be a fine not exceeding $500.00, plus costs of prosecution, or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or both, unless a specific penalty is otherwise provided for the violation by this Code or any ordinance. Each act or violation and every day upon any such violation shall occur, shall constitute a new and separate offense.

(h)  Public disclosure, contents. Whenever a public disclosure is required by this article, it may be made orally on the record at a meeting of the public body involved, or in a writing filed with the clerk, in both of which cases it shall be made a part of the record of a regular city council meeting, and in either event shall include:

    The city manager, together with the committee, shall for each fiscal year designate and set aside for exclusive selective solicitation from small and minority businesses approximately 35 percent of the value of anticipated total city contracts for procurement and/or construction in the following manner: Twenty percent for small businesses and 15 percent for minority businesses, and if the small and minority businesses do not utilize the 35 percent of such contracts, then procurement and/or construction contracts would be let under normal bidding procedures.

In the case of construction contracts, if all the bids exceed the budget figures, the city manager has the option of negotiating project changes with the lowest competitive bidder or putting the contract out to be rebid, with the rebidding remaining under the small and minority businesses selective solicitation program.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 497, adopted Feb. 12, 1996, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of §§ 1000-1009 of said ordinance as §§ 2-521-2-530 herein was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 2-521. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "City of Muskegon Heights Smoking Pollution Control Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 497, § 1000, 2-12-96) 
Sec. 2-522. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; and, 
(2)  Reliable studies have shown that breathing secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for several population groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and 
(3)  Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchi-constriction and bronchi-spasm; and, 
(4)  Non-smokers who suffer allergies, respiratory diseases and other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of such adverse reactions; and, 
(5)  Courts are increasingly awarding compensation for disability, workers' compensation, unemployment and entitlement to damages under traditional common law tort liabilities; and, 
(6)  Smoke is a potential cause of fires, and cigarette burns and ash stains on fixtures and furniture cause unnecessary losses; and, 
(7)  The state has passed the Clean Indoor Air Act with amendments (1986 PA 198, as amended by 1988 PA 294, 296 and 315), which states that an individual shall not smoke in a public place or at a public meeting, except in a designated smoking area. 
(b)  Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this article are: 
(1)  To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in enclosed areas of city facilities; and 
(2)  To strike a reasonable balance between the needs of persons who smoke and the need of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air; to recognized that where these needs conflict, that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority.

DIVISION II. - PROCEDURE 

Sec. 2-581. - Petitions and city council initiative. 
(a)  Improvements authorized by this chapter may be initiated by petition of the owners of record of lands constituting 51 percent of the frontage in case of highway or water main improvements, and 51 percent of the land area for sewer or underdrain improvements. The city council may initiate special assessment districts by resolution of the city council without petition of the owners of records, but if objection to the improvement is made at or before the first public hearing by the owners whose property is to be assessed an aggregate of 35 percent of the total amount to be assessed, then the city council shall not proceed with the improvement unless there shall be five members of the city council voting in favor of the proposed improvement. 
(b)  Record owners of land shall be determined as of the records of the tax assessment rolls of the city on the day of filing the petition or on the day the city council shall first initiate an improvement authorized by this division. In determining the sufficiency of the petition, lands not subject to special assessment and lands within the public streets and alleys shall not be included in computing frontage for assessment district areas. 
(c)  Any filed petitions may be supplemented by the filing of additional signatures and, in such case, the validity thereof shall be determined by the records of the tax assessment roll of the city on the date of filing the supplemental petition. 
(d)  The provisions of subsection (a) for objection shall not apply to improvements for which special assessments are authorized by subsection (g) of section 2-3. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-582. - First resolution; plans and estimates. 
    Upon the receipt of a petition for an improvement authorized by this division, or upon the initiative of the city council if it desires to proceed without a petition, there shall be a first resolution passed by the city council which shall cause plans and estimates to be prepared showing the improvement, the location and, in the case of projects for water, sewers or highways, the plans and estimates shall be prepared by a registered engineer. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-583. - Second resolution; establishment of special assessment district; notice. 
    As soon as the plans and estimates are prepared, or at the same time the first resolution is passed, if the city council desires to proceed further with the proposed improvement, it shall make a second resolution tentatively designating the special assessment district against which the cost of said improvement is to be assessed. Such resolution shall further set forth the time and place when and where the council will meet and hear objections to the improvement and to the special assessment district. Notice of the public hearing shall be given each owner of or party in interest to be assessed, whose name appears upon the last city tax assessment records, by mailing by first class mail addressed to such owner or party at the address shown on the tax records, at least ten days before the date of such hearing. The last city tax assessment records means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes which has been reviewed by the city board of review, as supplemented by any subsequent changes in the names or addresses of such owners or parties listed thereon. Where any person claims an interest in real property whose name and correct address do not appear upon the last city tax assessment record, he shall be obligated to file immediately his name and address with the city tax assessing officer. This requirement shall be deemed effective only for the purpose of establishing a record of the names and addresses of those persons entitled to notice of hearing in special assessment proceedings. It shall be the duty of the city tax assessing officer to immediately enter on the city tax assessment records any changes in the names and addresses of owners or parties in interest filed with him and at all times to keep such tax assessment records current, complete and available for public inspection. The notice to owners or persons interested in the property shall state that the plans and estimates will be on file at the city hall with the city clerk for examination; shall contain a brief description of the proposed special assessment district; and shall include the estimated cost of such improvement on a front foot, area or benefit basis. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-584. - Hearing on objections; modifications of second resolution. 
    The city council shall hold a hearing, which hearing may be adjourned, and shall hear any objections to the petition, the city council initiative, the improvement and to the special assessment district, and may revise, correct, amend or change the plans, estimated cost or special assessment district; however, no property shall be added to the special assessment district nor any increase in the estimate of cost in excess of ten percent above the original estimated costs unless notice is given as originally given for the hearing, or by personal service on the owners of the property in the entire proposed special assessment district and a hearing afforded to such owners. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-585. - Third resolution; contents; preparation of special assessment rolls. 
    After the hearing on objections provided for in this division, if the city council then desires to proceed with the improvement, it shall proceed with the third resolution, indicating its determination to make the improvement, approve the plans, approve the estimates of costs, approve any revisions, corrections, amendments or changes and shall also determine the prior sufficiency of the petition or the original initiative of the improvement. After such determination, the sufficiency of the petition or the initiative shall not thereafter be subject to attack except in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 day[s] after the adoption of the third resolution determining such sufficiency. The third resolution shall, in addition, provide for the final determination of the special assessment district and shall direct the city assessor to make the special assessment roll in which shall be entered and described all the parcels of land to be assessed, with the names of the respective owners thereof, if known, and the total amount to be assessed against each parcel of land, which amount shall be such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all parcels of land in the special assessment district as the benefit to the parcel of land bears to the total benefit of all parcels of land in the special assessment district. When the city assessor shall have completed his assessment roll, he shall affix thereto his certificate stating that it was made pursuant to the resolution of the city council adopted on a specified date and that in making the special assessment roll, he has, according to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions contained in the third resolution, this division and the statutes of the state. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-586. - Advertisement for bids; bids exceeding estimates. 
    The city council shall proceed to advertise and take bids in accordance with the purchasing provisions of this code and other ordinances of the city; however, if bids exceed the special assessment estimates by ten percent, then a further hearing and notice as required above shall be held before proceeding. At the further hearing, objections may be had with the same procedures as set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-587. - Confirmation of special assessment roll; adoption of the fourth resolution. 
    When the special assessment roll prepared pursuant to this article shall be reported by the assessor to the city council, the same shall be filed in the office of the city clerk. Before confirming the assessment roll, the city council shall appoint a time and place where it will meet and review the same and hear objections thereto and shall cause notice of such hearing and filing of such assessment roll to be mailed to each affected owner or person in interest as set forth in section 2-29. The city council shall revise the amount to be spread on the assessment roll in accordance with the actual contract bids and such additional costs as shall be computed in the total project. Such resolution will be known as the fourth resolution in the special assessment procedure. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-588. - Fifth resolution; establishment of assessment and installments; interest. 
    After the hearing provided for in this article for the confirmation of the special assessment roll and the special assessment roll has been spread on the actual costs, the final spread of the roll shall be reviewed by the city council, which shall then confirm the special assessment roll as reported to it by the city assessor or as amended or corrected by it, or may refer it back to the city assessor for further revision, or may annul it and direct a new roll to be made, which action shall be taken by the fifth resolution. When the special assessment roll has been confirmed, the city clerk shall endorse thereon the date of confirmation. After confirmation, the special assessment role and all assessments thereon shall be final and conclusive unless attached in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after confirmation and the entry of the resolution. The fifth resolution may provide that the assessments shall be payable in one or more approximately equal annual installments, not exceeding 15 in the case of highway improvements and not exceeding 30 in case of water, sewer or underdrain improvements. The first installment of a special assessment shall be due on or before such time after confirmation as the city council shall fix, and the several subsequent installments shall be due at intervals of 12 months from the due date of the first installment or from such other date as the city council shall fix. All unpaid installments prior to their transfer to the city tax roll as provided in this article shall draw interest at the rate of six percent per annum, commencing 90 days after the special assessment roll shall be confirmed as set forth in this section. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-589. - Apportionment upon the division of specially assessed property. 
    Should any parcel of land be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed pursuant to this division and before collection thereof, the city council may require the city assessor to apportion the uncollected amounts between the several divisions thereof, and a report of the apportionment, when confirmed by the city council, shall be conclusive upon all parties. 
(Ord. No. 05-551, 4-25-05) 
Sec. 2-590. - Reassessment upon invalidity of prior special assessment. 
    Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the city council, be invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings, of if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge a special assessment to be illegal, the city council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, proceed from the last step at which the proceedings were legal and cause a new assessment to be made for the same purposes for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in this article for an original assessment, or as near thereto as possible; and whenever an assessment or any part thereof levied upon any premises has been so set aside, if the special assessment has been paid and not refunded, the payments so made shall be applied against the reassessment. Any failure to give notice as required in this article shall not invalidate an entire special assessment role but only the assessment on the property affected by the lack of notice; however, in no case shall any special assessment be declared invalid as to any property thereof which has actually received notice, has waived notice or has paid any part of the assessment.

For purposes of this subsection, "building or structure" includes, but is not limited to, a commercial building or structure. This subsection does not apply to either of the following: 
(a)  A building or structure as to which the owner or agent does both of the following:

An owner who has given the notice prescribed by this subparagraph shall notify the police department not more than 30 days after the dwelling no longer qualifies for this exception. As used in this subparagraph, "secondary dwelling" means a dwelling such as a vacation home or summer home, that is occupied by the owner or a member of the owner's family during part of a year. 
    Any person entitled to a notice pursuant to Sec. 401.3 may appeal any notice in accordance with Section 501 of the Uniform Code. Failure to appeal the notice will constitute a waiver of the right to an administrative hearing.

The procedure for such action shall be the same as for an injunction or abatement of a nuisance. 
1.  The judgment of the court in such cause may direct the correction, repair or rehabilitation of the dwelling or building, or the abatement of the nuisance, may authorize a reasonable time within which the defendant may make such correction or abatement and may authorize the city to execute and carry out the provisions of the judgment in case of default of the defendant.

Whenever the city has incurred any expense, including attorney fees, in the enforcement of this Code or in obtaining a judgment of the court or if inspection fees are due, the same may be recovered. 
b.  The city shall have a lien upon the premises for all fees due and amounts expended to correct, repair, rehabilitate or abate a condition or nuisance thereon and for expenses necessarily incurred in the obtaining and executing of a judgment, which lien shall have priority over all other liens or encumbrances except taxes, assessments or mortgages recorded previous to the existence of such lien. Such lien may be enforced by levy as in the case of real property taxes, by person action or judicial foreclosure. The lien shall be effective on the date billed by the city. 
c.  In any action instituted by the city under this section, the city attorney may file in the office of the register of deeds of the county a notice of the pendency of the actions or proceedings. A notice may be filed at the time of the commencement of the action or proceeding, or at any time thereafter before final judgment or order, or at any time after the service of any notice or order issued by the city. Then notice shall have the same force and effect as a lis pendens. Such notice may be vacated upon the order of the judge of the court in which the action or proceeding was instituted or is pending, or by consent in writing of the city or the city attorney. 
(17)  Prosecution not delayed. Nothing in this article shall delay or be a cause of terminating the prosecution of a defendant for failure to correct violations of this Code noted in a final notice to repair or an emergency.

The applicant shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the city manager may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on such commerce.

(c)  Section 626 of the Cable Act provides as follows: 
Renewal 
Sec. 626. 
(a)  During the six-month period which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration, the franchising authority may on its own initiative, and shall at the request of the cable operator, commence proceedings which afford the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of: 
(1)  Identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests; and 
(2)  Reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then current franchise term. 
    (b) 
(1)  Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a), a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority, submit a proposal for renewal. 
(2)  Subject to section 624, any such proposal shall contain such material as the franchising authority may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system. 
(3)  The franchising authority may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.

(1)  Upon submittal by a cable operator of a proposal to the franchising authority for the renewal of a franchise, the franchising authority shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the four-month period which begins on the completion of any proceedings under subsection (a) renew the franchise, or issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the operator or on its own initiative, commence an administration proceeding after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding in accordance with paragraph (2) to consider whether: 
(A)  The cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; 
(B)  The quality of the operator's service including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs; 
(C)  The operator has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the operator's proposal; and 
(D)  The operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests. 
(2)  In any proceeding under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the franchising authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence [including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (a)], to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding. 
(3)  At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection, the franchising authority shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor. 
(d)  Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1), pursuant to the record of proceedings under subsection (c). A franchising authority may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) occur after the effective date of this title unless the franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or has effectively acquiesced. 
    (e) 
(1)  Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the franchising authority to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of section 635. 
(2)  The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that: 
(A)  Any action of the franchising authority is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or 
(B)  In the event of a final decision of the franchising authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the franchising authority with respect to each of the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (c). 
(f)  Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by the state has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed. 
(g)  For purposes of this section, the term "franchise expiration" means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on the date of the enactment of this title. 
(h)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced). The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (a) through (g).

Sec. 38-30. - Legislative findings with respect to drug use and prostitution or soliciting for prostitution. 
    The city council determines that whenever the repeated use, sale, furnishing, giving or possession of controlled substances or drug paraphernalia occurs on any property or whenever property is repeatedly used for violation of the controlled substances or drug paraphernalia laws or for purposes of prostitution or soliciting for prostitution, a public nuisance may result. Such a public nuisance results from the increased criminal activity that occurs in the neighborhood surrounding the property, increased pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the property, the fear engendered in the minds of neighbors and the peace and quiet of residents living in the neighborhood surrounding the property being disturbed. 
(Ord. No. 97-509, 10-13-97) 
Sec. 38-31. - Authority for declaration of a public nuisance. 
    Whenever the illegal use, sale, furnishing, giving or possession of controlled substances or drug paraphernalia repeatedly occurs on any property or when any violation of the controlled substances act or the drug paraphernalia laws or any act of prostitution or soliciting for prostitution occurs repeatedly on any property, the city council may declare by resolution that the property is a public nuisance and order that the nuisance be abated as provided in this division. 
(Ord. No. 97-509, 10-13-97) 
Sec. 38-32. - Procedure for declaration of a public nuisance. 
    A declaration of a public nuisance under the authority of this division shall occur only in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  Such a declaration may occur only after there has been notice given to the owner of the property and the owner has had an opportunity to be heard at a public evidentiary hearing before the city council. 
(2)  Notice of the public evidentiary hearing shall be given to the owner and shall consist of personal service or the mailing of a certified letter to the owner at the address indicated by the city assessor's records, the records of the register of deeds of Muskegon County and the records of the city's housing inspection office. The notice shall state the nature of the alleged nuisance and the time, date and location of the hearing. If the notice is served by certified mail, it shall be delivered with a return receipt requested according to the practices of the post office. Receipt of the return receipt card by the city indicating the owner's having received such notice shall be deemed notice to the owner. Such notice to an owner shall occur at least seven calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing. As used in this division, "the owner," "an owner," or "owner" shall mean any and all persons that the city is aware of who have or who may have an ownership interest as defined in this division. Whenever this division provides for notice to the owner, it shall be construed to mean that notice shall be given to all persons having a known ownership interest as so defined. 
(3)  The city council, pursuant to city Charter sections 5a, 5h, 5i and 5m, shall make a determination as to whether a public nuisance exists under the standards established by this division. The city council shall make this determination based solely upon the evidence presented at the public evidentiary hearing. In conducting the public evidentiary hearing, the city council shall afford the owner and the police department an opportunity to present relevant and material evidence and to make arguments as to factual or legal issues. Cross-examination of opposing witnesses shall be permitted. The owner may appear in person or be represented by an attorney. Lay representation is not permitted.

    If the city council determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a property is a public nuisance, it may, by resolution, in addition to any other remedies available to the city at law or in equity, order abatement of the nuisance. 
(1)  The abatement process shall be conducted as follows: 
a.  If it is determined that all or a portion of the property is to be ordered vacated, the city council shall order the property vacated and declare that occupancy of all or a portion of the property is prohibited and authorize the police department to prohibit the occupancy of the property by either padlocking all or a portion of the property or boarding or otherwise securing all or a portion of the property, as is appropriate, for a period of up to one year as the city council shall determine based upon the evidence; and/or 
b.  Determine that the owner shall be liable for the full cost of any materials and personnel (including police and any other city employees or contractors) involved in the padlocking, boarding or securing of the property in the first instance and the full cost of any personnel and materials involved in any subsequent or remedial padlocking, boarding or securing of the property; and/or 
c.  Determine that the costs set out herein shall be a personal debt of the owner and/or assess those costs against the property as a lien as provided for in the city Charter. 
(2)  Where only a discreet area under the control of a person or persons other than the owner is involved in the illegal activity, the city council shall not order that any part of the property other than the part used for the illegal activity be vacated. It is the intent of this provision to protect those truly and completely innocent of any participation in the act and those not having any notice of, or direct or imputed knowledge of, the illegal acts from being deprived of the use of their property. By way of example and not limitation, if only a single apartment in a multiple dwelling is used for illegal purposes as provided for in this division, the city council may vacate only the apartment used for the illegal purposes and shall not vacate the entire building.

(3)  A letter, informing the owner that an illegal controlled substance and/or illegal drug paraphernalia has been found by the police at the property or that a drug-related or drug paraphernalia-related crime has been committed on the property, and of the potential consequences if a similar activity occurs at the property, has been:

The circuit court's review shall be made upon the record made before the city council. It is the responsibility of the appealing party to demonstrate error.

DIVISION 3. - NUISANCE ABATEMENT CONTRACTOR PROGRAM 

Sec. 38-66. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council finds that: 
(1)  Scattered throughout the city are a large number of unoccupied dwellings which are constantly broken into, vandalized, used for unsanitary or illegal purposes and are potential fire hazards. 
(2)  There are many unoccupied dwellings in the city which, because of their vacant status, constitute hazards to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
(3)  Certain vacant dwellings have reached a stage of disrepair and deterioration which create a public nuisance or exert a downgrading or blighting influence on the surrounding neighborhood, resulting in discouraging neighbors from making improvements to the properties and thus adversely affecting the tax revenue of the city. 
(4)  Currently, tax delinquent abandoned dwellings revert to the state and are then deeded to the city through the state tax reversion process. However, this process takes several years, during which many dwellings are lost through vandalism and deterioration. 
(5)  Acquisition of abandoned dwellings by purchase or gift, or through exercise of the power of eminent domain, and permitting individuals to repair and reside therein under contract with the city will preserve the residential housing stock of the city, increase neighborhood stability, and provide needed homes for city families.

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 46-26. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Code 1965, § 8.311) 
Sec. 46-27. - Statement of purpose of article. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Code 1965, § 8.312) 
Sec. 46-28. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purpose, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosions or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Code 1965, § 8.313)

Sec. 82-269. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards (FCPS). 
(a)  Inclusion in standard. If an FCPS is promulgated for a subcategory under which a user believes itself to be included, the user or the county director may request, within 30 days after the promulgation date, of the appropriate state or federal official a written certification to the effect that the user does or does not fall within that particular subcategory. Such request shall be made and reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a), as amended. 
(b)  Compliance date. A user to which a promulgated FCPS applies shall achieve compliance with such standard within the time period provided for in 40 CFR 403.6(b), as amended and 40 CFR 403.7, whichever is later. 
(c)  Revision of FCPS for consistent removal. Revision of FCPS for consistent removal shall be accomplished as follows: 
(1)  Revision. The DPW board may, on its own, and will, if requested by a user, revise discharge limits for specific pollutants covered in a FCPS consistent with 40 CFR 403.7, as amended, and consistent with this article. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the requirements of 40 CFR 403.7 for such revision cannot be met or the discharge pursuant to such revision would cause interference. 
(2)  Conditional revision. Whether or not the DPW board has a pretreatment program approved in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8, 403.9 and 403.11, as amended, the DPW board may, on its own, and will, if requested by a user, conditionally revise the discharge limits for specific pollutants consistent with 40 CFR 403.7, as amended, and consistent with this article. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the requirements of 40 CFR 403.7 for such revision cannot be met or the discharge pursuant to such revision would cause interference. 
(3)  Provisional revisions. With respect to pollutants which are not currently being discharged and whether or not the DPW board has a pretreatment program approved in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8, 403.9 and 403.11, as amended, the DPW board may, on its own, and will, if requested by a user, provisionally revise the applicable FCPS prior to initial discharge of the pollutant consistent with 40 CFR 403.7, as amended, and consistent with this article. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the requirements of 40 CFR 403.7 for such revision cannot be met or the discharge pursuant to such revision would cause interference. 
(4)  Information and costs. In connection with any revision described in subsection (c) of this section, the DPW board, in accordance with section 82-268, shall prepare and submit such data, reports, certifications, pretreatment programs and other information and shall establish such compliance schedules with users as are required by 40 CFR 403, as amended, to support the abovedescribed revisions. Any user with respect to whom such revisions are made shall accept compliance schedules established in accordance with section 82-268 by the DPW board and shall submit to the DPW board such data, reports and other information required to be submitted by the user to the DPW board or accepted by the user by 40 CFR 403, as amended, to support such revisions. If the request for such revision was initiated by the user or a category of users, then such user or users shall reimburse the DPW board for the reasonable costs incurred and expenditures made by the DPW board in connection with the first sentence of subsection (c)(4) of this section, exclusive of the pretreatment program. Such costs and expenditures shall not include amounts expended by the DPW board in connection with such data, reports, certifications and other information which are required by division 5 of this article, the county's NPDES permits, or under any applicable law or regulation whether or not such revision is made. The county director may request a deposit from such user to cover the estimated costs. Nothing shall prevent a user from voluntarily providing additional information, reimbursements and support to the DPW board in connection with any revision. 
(d)  Variance. Any user, interested person or the USEPA (requestor) may request a variance, based upon fundamentally different factors, from the limits specified in a FCPS by submitting a written request to the state director. Such requests are to be submitted within the time and shall include the information required by 40 CFR 403.13, as amended. If a variance is granted then the terms of same shall apply to the affected user. 
(e)  Notice to municipality. If a revision is made or applied for or a variance request is made, the DPW board, in the case of a revision, and the requestor, in the case of a variance shall notify the municipality (in which users are located who are, or whose discharge is, the subject of the revision or variance) that the revision has been made or applied for or that a variance request has been made and the proposed effective date thereof, where applicable. 
(f)  Public participation. In compliance with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR 25, in the enforcement of national pretreatment standards as specified in section 403.8, the director shall provide public notification, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality in which the POTW is located, of industrial users which during the previous 12 months were significantly violating applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements. For the purpose of this section, a significant violation is a violation which remains uncorrected 45 days after notification of noncompliance, which is part of a pattern of noncompliance over a 12-month period, which involves a failure to accurately report noncompliance, or which resulted in the POTW exercising its emergency authority under section 403.8(F)(1)(IV)(B).

Sec. 82-416. - Collection. 
    The department is hereby authorized to enforce the payment of charges for water service to any premises by discontinuing the water service to such premises and the payment of charges for sewage disposal service to any premises may be enforced by discontinuing either the water service or the sewage disposal service to such premises, or both, and an action of assumpsit may be instituted by the city against the customer. The charges for water service and sewage disposal service, which, under the provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), as amended, are made a lien on the premises to which furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien. The director shall annually, on April 1, certify all unpaid charges for such services furnished to any premises which, on March 31 preceding, have remained unpaid for a period of six months to the city assessor who shall place the same on the next tax roll of the city. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as general city taxes. In cases where the city is properly notified in writing in accordance with Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), as amended, that a tenant is responsible for water or sewage disposal service charges, no such service shall be commenced or continued to such premises until there has been deposited with the department, a sum sufficient to cover three times the average quarterly bill for such premises as estimated by the director. Such deposit shall be in no case less than $25.00. Where the water service to any premises is turned off to enforce the payment of water service charges or sewage disposal service charges, the water service shall not be recommenced until all delinquent charges have been paid and a deposit as in the case of tenants is made. There shall be a water turn-on charge of $25.00 during normal working hours and a charge that reflects the actual cost to the department after normal working hours. In any other case where, in the discretion of the director, the collection of charges for water or sewage disposal service may be difficult or uncertain, the director may require a similar deposit. Such deposits may be applied against any delinquent water or sewage disposal service charges, and the application shall not affect the right of the department to turn off the water service and/or sewer service, to any premises for any delinquency thereby satisfied. No such deposit shall bear interest, and such deposit, or any remaining balance, shall be returned to the customer making the same when he shall discontinue receiving water and sewage disposal service or, except as to tenants as to whom notice of responsibility for such charges has been filed with the city, when any eight successive quarterly bills shall have been paid by the customer with no delinquency.

SECTION 402: [RESERVED] [amended 8/01]
SECTION 403: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OPTION [amended 12/97]
Planned unit developments (PUDs) may be allowed by the Planning Commission under the
procedural guidelines of Section 2101. The intent of Planned Unit Developments in the single
family residential district is to allow for flexibility in the design of housing developments,
including but not limited to condominium developments and cluster subdivisions, to allow for
the preservation of open space; allow for economies in the provision of utilities and public
services; provide recreational opportunities; and protect important natural features from the
adverse impacts of development.
1. Determination: The Planning Commission, in reviewing and approving a proposed PUD
may allow lots within the PUD to be reduced in area and width and setbacks below the
minimum normally required by this ordinance in return for common open space where it
is determined that the benefits of the cluster approach will decrease development costs,
increase recreational opportunities, or prevent the loss of natural features. The Planning
Commission, in its determination, shall consider the densities permitted in the Zoning
Ordinance and, if applicable, the lands capability to bear the higher density.
2. Basic Requirements:
49
a. The net residential acreage including improvements and occupied land shall be
calculated by taking the total area of the tract and subtracting, in order, the
following:
1) Portions of the parcel(s) shown to be in a floodplain.
2) Portions of the parcel(s) which are unsuitable for development in their
natural state due to topographical, drainage or subsoil conditions such as,
but not limited to; slopes greater than 15%; organic, poorly drained soils,
and wetlands.
3) Portions of the parcel(s) covered by surface waters.
4) Portions of the tract utilized for storm water management facilities.
b. Undevelopable areas may be used for common open and recreational areas.
c. No building shall be sited on slopes steeper than 15%, within 100 feet of any
ordinary high water mark, wetland, or on soil classified as being very poorly
drained.
3. Density determination: To determine the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on
the parcel(s) of land, the net residential acreage shall be divided by the minimum lot size
required by the zoning ordinance.
4. Open space requirement: At least 15% of the site shall be set aside as dedicated common
open space. At least one third (1/3) of the common open space shall be usable open space.
The open space and access to it shall be permanently marked and designed so individuals in
the development are not forced to trespass to reach such recreational or common open spaces.
5. Spacing: The distance between buildings shall not be less than 10 feet and front setbacks
shall not be less than 10 feet.
6. Waterfront: Where a cluster development abuts a body of water, at least 50% of the
shoreline, as well as reasonable access to it, shall be a part of the common open space land.
7. Utility of common open space: Common open space in any one residential cluster shall be
laid out, to the maximum extent feasible, to connect with other open space existing or
proposed.
8. Size: Minimum parent parcel size is 21,780 square feet (one-half acre).
9. Bonus units: Where the developer provides additional open space or amenities within the
development, additional density may be granted. A maximum of a 10% unit bonus may be
granted to the development for additional amenities such as: public trail easements,
additional open space, additional common waterfront area, and additional landscaping.

ARTICLE V - MHP MOBILE HOME PARK DISTRICTS
PREAMBLE
The MHP Mobile Home Park Districts are established primarily to provide for higher density
single family detached, residential dwelling units, and assist in meeting adopted Master Land Use
Plan Residential Goals and Objectives of providing diversified housing types in the City of
Muskegon. Also, because mobile home parks are much higher in density than an otherwise
typical single family subdivision, and because they are developed with private street systems,
thereby creating an interruption in the continuity of the local public street system, they are
otherwise not totally compatible with lower density single family subdivision. In this Ordinance,
mobile homes are intended to serve as an alternative housing type to other forms of residential
development.
SECTION 500: HEIGHT REGULATIONS
In the Mobile Home Park District, no structure shall exceed a height of twenty-five (25) feet or
two (2) stories.
SECTION 501: AREA REGULATIONS
The mobile home park shall be developed with sites averaging 5,500 square feet per mobile
home unit. This 5,500 square feet for any one site may be reduced by 20 percent provided that
the individual site shall be equal to at least 4,400 square feet. For each square foot of land gained
through the reduction of a site below 5,500 square feet, at least an equal amount of land shall be
dedicated as open space, but in no case shall the open space and distance requirements be less
than that required under R 125.1946, Rule 946 and R 125.1941 and R 125.1944, Rules 941 and
944 of the Michigan Administrative Code.
SECTION 502: SETBACK

feet if any residential district measured from the lot line of the location of the
proposed use.
b. The Planning Commission may waive this location provision if the following
findings are made:
1) That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or
injurious to nearby properties and that the spirit and intent of this
Ordinance will be observed.
2) That the character of the area shall be maintained.
117
3) That all applicable regulations of this Ordinance will be observed.
4) That no other adult bookstore, adult motion picture theater, or cabaret is
located within two thousand (2,000) feet of the proposed location.
c. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Planning Commission shall
not consider the waiver of the locational requirements as hereinabove set forth
until a petition shall have been filed with the City Clerk and verified as to
sufficiency. Such petition shall indicate approval of the proposed regulated use by
fifty-one (51) percent or more of the persons owning property within a radius of
one thousand (1,000) feet of the location of the proposed use as measured from
the lot line. The petitioner, or his agent, shall attempt to contact all eligible
property owners within this radius and must maintain a list of all addresses at
which no contact was made.
d. The petition hereafter required shall contain an affidavit signed by the party
circulating such petition attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated by
him and that the circulator personally witnessed the signatures on the petition and

WI-PUD WATERFRONT INDUSTRIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
DISTRICTS
PREAMBLE
The Waterfront Industrial PUD district is established primarily for water-dependent, commercial
shipping of bulk, general cargo, or container goods by freighter, bulk carrier, tanker, tug barge, or
other similar commercial vessels. The WI-PUD District is intended to promote the consolidation
of commercial port activities at the eastern terminus of Muskegon Lake because of its proximity
to the interstate, established industrial uses, and isolation from residential zones. The intent is to
localize this district to promote symbiotic relationships among industrial port activities and to
discourage the expansion of such activities elsewhere along Muskegon Lake frontage. It is
further the intent of this district to require planned unit developments for all projects to ensure a
mix of port uses that enhances the industrial economic base of the city. The planned unit
development tool shall be applied to promote flexibility in development and to enhance
functional relationships among uses in the district.
The general categories of uses permitted in the WI-PUD district are associated with standard

adequate protection and safeguards for the site or surrounding area.
This option is intended to accommodate developments with mixed or varied uses, to
allow some degree of flexibility in the application of standards and regulations in this
Ordinance to achieve innovation to development on sites with unusual topography or
unique settings within the community, or on land which exhibits difficult or costly
development problems, and shall not be allowed where this option is sought primarily to
avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of zoning classifications rather than
to achieve the stated purposes above.

ARTICLE XXII  NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, AND STRUCTURES
SECTION 2200: INTENT
Upon the adoption of this Ordinance or future amendments, there may exist lots, structures, and
uses of land and structures which were lawful prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, or
amendment to the Ordinance, but which are not in conformance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, or any amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconforming
lots, structures and uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
Because nonconforming lots, structures and uses, so long as they exist, prevent the full
achievement of the goals and objectives of the City of Muskegon Master Plan, the spirit of this
Ordinance is to reduce, rather than increase, any nonconformance.
SECTION 2201: NONCONFORMING LOTS
When an existing nonconforming lot does not adjoin any other lot or lots under common
ownership or if the nonconforming lot fails to meet the requirements for minimum lot area,
minimum width, or both, of the zoning district in which it is located, such lot may be used for the
permitted uses of the zoning district under the following conditions:
1. It must meet the definition of Lot of Record listed in the definitions of this Ordinance.
2. In any zoning district, where two or more adjoining nonconforming lots are under
common ownership, these lots shall be combined and considered as one lot for the
purposes of this ordinance.
3. The nonconforming lot must still meet setback requirements of its zoning district and is
subject to certain limitations provided by other provisions of this Ordinance.
SECTION 2202: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, lawful use of land
exists that is made unlawful under the terms of this Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use
may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. Special land uses and use variances permitted by this ordinance shall not be deemed
nonconforming uses.
2. Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of
land may be made, provided that there is no change in the nature or character of the
nonconforming use.
3. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
-151-
Ordinance, except when authorized by the Planning Commission, after Public Hearing as
required for Special Uses, and upon reaching a determination that the proposed
enlargement, increase, or greater area:
a. Does not have a substantial detrimental effect on the use and enjoyment of
adjacent uses or lots.
b. Complies with all parking, sign, or other applicable regulations applicable to
accessory uses for the area affected by the proposed enlargement, increase, or
greater area.
c. Complies with any reasonable conditions imposed by the Planning Commission
that are necessary to ensure that the proposed enlargement, increase, or greater
area will not prove detrimental to adjacent properties, the neighborhood, or the
community.
d. It is not larger than twenty five percent (25%) of the original nonconforming area.
4. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the
lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance.
5. A nonconforming use of land which has ceased for a period exceeding twenty-four (24)
months or has been changed to a conforming use may not again be devoted to a
nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one (1)
or more of the following conditions exists, and which shall be deemed to constitute an
intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the nonconforming use;
a. Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property, have been
discontinued.
b. The property, buildings and grounds have fallen into disrepair.
c. Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming use have been
removed.
d. Removal of equipment or fixtures which are necessary for the operation of the
nonconforming use.
e. Other actions, which in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, constitute an act
or omission on the part of the property owner or lessee constituting an intent to
abandon the nonconforming use.
6. When such nonconforming use is made more conforming than the use which previously
existed, it may continue even though it does not totally conform to all provisions of this
Ordinance.
SECTION 2203: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance
that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area lot
coverage, height, yards, parking or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot,
-152-
such structure may be continued so along as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity,
except when authorized by the Planning Commission, after Public Hearing as required for
Special Uses. The Planning Commission shall be authorized to determine the amount of
enlargement of any building or structure, consistent with the intent of this article. The
nonconforming structure may be changed to an extent not exceeding thirty percent (30%)
of the total floor area of the existing building at the time of enactment of the Ordinance
from which this chapter is derived, or at the time of its amendment making a structure
nonconforming.
2. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or part to any other
location unless such building or structure and the off-street parking spaces, yard and other
open spaces provided, are made to conform to all the regulations of the district in which
such building or structure is to be located.
3. Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming structures
may be made, provided that there is no change in the nature or character of the
nonconforming structure.
4. Repair and maintenance work may be performed as required to keep a nonconforming
building or structure in a sound condition.
5. In the event any nonconforming building or structure is damaged by fire, wind, civil
disobedience, or an Act Of God or the public enemy, it may be rebuilt or restored,
provided the cost of such structural alteration or structural repairs shall not exceed
seventy-five (75) percent of its replacement cost. The buildings or structures shall be
built in conformance with the requirement of the zoning district in which they are located.
6. Once any nonconforming structure is removed from the property, its nonconforming
status has expired and it may not be replaced on the property.
SECTION 2204: [RESERVED]
SECTION 2205: POWER OF CONDEMNATION
The City may acquire by purchase, by condemnation, or otherwise private property or an interest
in private property for the removal of nonconforming uses and structures, except that the property
shall not be used for pubic housing. The City Commission may provide that the cost and
expense of acquiring private property be paid from general funds, or the cost and expense, or a
portion thereof, be assessed as a Special Assessment District. The elimination of nonconforming
uses and structures in a zoned district is declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use.
-153-
The City Commission may institute and prosecute proceedings for the condemnation of
nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain in accordance with the
provisions of the City Charter relative to condemnation or in accordance with Act No. 87 of the
Pubic Acts of 1980, being Section 213.51 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or any other
applicable statute.
-154-
ARTICLE XXIII - GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 2300: INTENT AND PURPOSE
The following general provisions establish regulations that are applicable in all zoning districts
unless otherwise indicated.
SECTION 2301: EFFECT OF ZONING
1. Zoning applies to every building and use. No building or land shall be used or occupied,
and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved, placed, reconstructed, extended,
enlarged or altered, except in conformity with this Ordinance.
2. Any land use not specifically permitted by right or special use permit is prohibited.
3. In the event any building or part thereof is used, erected, altered or occupied contrary to
law or the provisions of this Ordinance, such building shall be declared a nuisance per se
and may be required to be vacated, torn down or abated by any legal means and shall not
be used or occupied until it has been brought into conformance.
4. If construction of a building is lawfully begun so that there are substantial tangible
changes in the property prior to adoption of this Ordinance, nothing in this Ordinance
shall be deemed to require any change in the planned or designed use of any such
building, provided that actual construction is being diligently carried on, and further
provided that such building shall be entirely completed for its planned or designed use
within two (2) years from the effective date of this Ordinance.
SECTION 2302: LAND DISTURBANCES
1. Clearing of a Site: Unless associated with a bona fide public works project, it shall be
unlawful for any person, individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal
entity to engage in land clearing, including the stripping and removal of topsoil, from
any site, parcel, or lot within the City without first receiving a Development Permit.
2. Grading and Filling of Property: In order to protect adjacent properties, public roads,
public watercourses, and to provide for adequate drainage of surface water, in addition to
adhering to adopted soil erosion and stormwater management requirements of the City,
the following rules shall apply to all construction activities pursuant to this Ordinance.
a. Flow Alterations: The final grade surface of ground areas surrounding a building
or structure shall be designed and landscaped such that surface water flow away
from the building or structure is managed in a manner which prevents:
1) Increased flow onto adjacent properties or public roads
2) Erosion or filling of a roadside ditch
-155-
3) Blockage of a public watercourse or drain
4) Creation of standing water, other than in an approved detention or
retention pond.
5) Direct discharge into surface water.
b. Elevation Restrictions: Filling a parcel of land with earth or other materials to an
elevation above the established grade of adjacent developed land is prohibited
without obtaining approval from the City Engineering Department.

requires a state, or federal permit until satisfactory evidence of such has been submitted.
Examples of such permits include (but are not limited to) critical dunes, air quality,
wetlands, inland lakes dredge and fill, floodplain and activities under the jurisdiction of
state soil erosion and sedimentation regulations.
SECTION 2303: PLOT PLAN REQUIRED
A plot plan depicts a subset of the information required by this Ordinance for a site plan. A plot
plan is required for changes to lots in single family zones. Full site plans are required for special
uses, planned unit developments, multi-family, commercial and industrial development.
The Building Official shall require that all applications for residential building permits be
accompanied by an acceptable plot plan, drawn to scale, showing the following:
1. The actual shape, location, and dimensions of the lot.
2. The shape, size, and location of all buildings or other structures to be erected, altered, or
moved, and of any building or other structure already on the lot including sheds, garages,
pools, satellite dishes over twenty four inches (24) in diameter, mechanical equipment
service buildings, etc.
3. The existing and intended use of the lot and of all such structures upon it.
4. Such other information concerning the lot or adjoining lots as may be essential for
determining whether the requirements of this Ordinance are being met.

7. Gas, sewer and water lines serving the property.
8. Overhead electrical wires.
9. Access drives and parking areas.
-156-
SECTION 2304: ONE BUILDING TO A LOT
No more than one principal building may be permanently established on a lot or parcel, unless
specifically provided for elsewhere in this Ordinance as in the case of a condominium
development, site planned use, planned unit development, or multiple family development.
SECTION 2305: REDUCTION OF PARCELS BELOW MINIMUM REQUIRED SIZE,
WIDTH, OR DEPTH
No parcel, whether or not platted as a lot, shall be split or reduced in size, width, or depth by any
conveyance, survey, leasing, occupancy, or other means which creates a parcel substandard in
size, width, or depth according to the requirements of this zoning ordinance. The splitting of a
lot or parcel to add to another shall not be allowed unless the remaining portion is of legal size,
width, and depth for the zone where the split parcel is located, or it is simultaneously combined
by conveyance with a contiguous parcel which will thereafter be of legal size, width, and depth.
Further, if contiguous nonconforming lots or parcels whether or not of record, are under
common ownership or control, they shall be combined to meet the provisions of this Ordinance
prior to permitting future site development or the issuance of a building permit.
SECTION 2306: ALLOCATION OF LOT AREAS & CONFIGURATION OF LOTS
1. Setback and yard allocations: No portion of a lot can be used more than once in
complying with the provisions for lot area and yard dimensions for construction or

adjacent to a public road or approved private road.
-157-
SECTION 2307: PERMITTED YARD ENCROACHMENTS
Encroachments may be made upon required yards under the following conditions: [amended
10/02]
1. Architectural elements: Existing buildings or structures shall be permitted to encroach

of a handicap wheelchair ramp, the Zoning Administrator may waive setback
requirements at his/her discretion, if no other options are available to provide a ramp,
provided that the applicant agrees to remove the ramp if it is no longer necessary on the
property. A performance letter or performance guarantee may be required. [amended
8/00]
4. Additions: Additions to homes on minor streets (not collectors), built in subdivisions
ninety percent (90%) developed with homes prior to 1940 may encroach upon existing
yards so long as:
a. A minimum 10 foot front setback is maintained
b. A minimum 15 foot rear setback is maintained
c. Lot coverage, with accessory structures does not exceed 50% [amended 8/00]
d. The addition does not further encroach upon existing side yards

SECTION 2310: CRITICAL DUNES
1. Purpose. In keeping with the findings of the Michigan legislature and the authority granted to
local government in Public Act 451 of 1994, as amended, the City of Muskegon hereby
declares that:
a. The critical dune areas within the City of Muskegon are a unique, irreplaceable, and
fragile resource that provide significant recreational, economic, scientific, geological,
scenic, botanical, educational, agricultural, and ecological benefits to the people of
this community, to the state, and to the people from other states and countries who
visit this resource.
b. The purpose of this ordinance is to balance for present and future generations the
benefits of protecting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing the diversity, quality,
functions, and values of the state's critical dunes with the benefits of economic
development and multiple human uses of the critical dunes and the benefits of public
access to and enjoyment of the critical dunes. To accomplish this purpose, this
ordinance is intended to do all of the following:
 Ensure and enhance the diversity, quality, functions, and values of the critical
dunes in a manner that is compatible with private property rights.
 Ensure sound management of all critical dunes by allowing for compatible
economic development and multiple human uses of the critical dunes.
 Coordinate and streamline governmental decision-making affecting critical
dunes through the use of the most comprehensive, accurate, and reliable
information and scientific data available.
c. The benefits derived from alteration, industrial, residential, commercial, agricultural,
sylvicultural, and the recreational use of critical dune areas shall occur only when the
protection of the environment and the ecology of the critical dune areas for the benefit
of the present and future generations is assured.
d. The following regulations embodied in this Dune Overlay Zone are adopted as the
minimum measures necessary to achieve these ends.
2. Definitions  As used in this section,
a. "Contour change" includes any grading, filling, digging, or excavating that
significantly alters the physical characteristic of a critical dune area, except that which
is involved in sand dune mining.
b. "Crest" means the line at which the first lakeward facing slope of a critical dune ridge
breaks to a slope of less than 1-foot vertical rise in a 5-1/2-foot horizontal plane for a
-160-
distance of at least 20 feet, if the areal extent where this break occurs is greater than
1/10 acre in size.
c. "Critical dune area" means a geographic area designated in the "Atlas of Critical
Dune Areas" dated February 1989 that was prepared by the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources and any other locally designated sand dune areas included on the
City of Muskegon Zoning Map.

the sole discretion of the applicant or owner, a shared driveway.
e. "Foredune" means one or more low linear dune ridges that are parallel and adjacent to
the shoreline of a Great Lake and are rarely greater than 20 feet in height. The
lakeward face of a foredune is often gently sloping and may be vegetated with dune
grasses and low shrub vegetation or may have an exposed sand face.
f. "Permit" means a permit for a use within a critical dune area.
g. "Restabilization" means restoration of the natural contours of a critical dune to the
extent practicable, the restoration of the protective vegetative cover of a critical dune
through the establishment of indigenous vegetation, and the placement of snow
fencing or other temporary sand trapping measures for the purpose of preventing
erosion, drifting, and slumping of sand.
h. Sand dune mining means the removal of sand from sand dine areas for commercial
or industrial purposes.
i. "Special use project" means any of the following:
 A proposed use in a critical dune area for an industrial or commercial purpose

occur if a variance is not granted, primary consideration shall be given to assuring
that human health and safety are protected by the determination and that the
determination complies with applicable local zoning, other state laws, and federal
law. If a practical difficulty will occur to the owner of the property if the variance
is not granted, a variance shall be granted under this Section unless the Zoning
Board of Appeals determines that the use will significantly damage the public
interest on the privately owned land, or, if the land is publicly owned, the public
interest in the publicly owned land, by significant and unreasonable depletion or
degradation of any of the following:
 The diversity of the critical dune areas within the local unit of
government.
 The quality of the critical dune areas within the local unit of
government.
 The functions of the critical dune areas within the local unit of
government.
b. The decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be in writing and shall be
based upon evidence that would meet the standards in Section 75 of the
Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.275. A decision
denying a variance shall document, and any review upholding the decision shall
determine, all of the following:

methods.
 That the decision has applied the principles and methods reliably to
the facts.
 That the facts or data upon which the decision is based are recorded
in the file.
c. The City of Muskegon shall not require an environmental site assessment or
environmental impact statement for a variance except for a special use project.
d. A variance shall not be granted from a setback requirement provided for
under Section 35034 pursuant to Part 353 of the Public Act 451 of 1994 unless
the property for which the variance is requested is one of the following:
-169-
 A nonconforming lot of record that is recorded prior to July 5, 1989,
and that becomes nonconforming due to the operation of Part 353.
 A lot legally created after July 5, 1989 that later becomes
nonconforming due to natural shoreline erosion.
 Property on which the base of the first landward critical dune of at
least 20 feet in height that is not a foredune is located at least 500 feet
inland from the first foredune crest or line of vegetation on the property.
However, the setback shall be a minimum of 200 feet measured from the
foredune crest or line of vegetation.
21. Penalties. In addition to the penalty provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of Public
Act 451 of 1994 shall apply in the event of any violation. Pursuant to the Public Act, a court
may impose on a person who violates any provision of this Dune Overlay Zone, or a
provision of a permit issued hereunder, a civil fine of not more than $5,000 for each day of
violation, or order a violator to pay the full cost of the full cost of restabilization of a critical
dune area or other natural resource that is damaged or destroyed as a result of a violation, or
both. If a person is ordered by the Zoning Administrator to restore a critical dune that has
been degraded by that person, the Zoning Administrator shall establish a procedure by which
the restoration of the critical dune area is monitored to assure that the restoration is completed
in a satisfactory manner.
22. Applicable Law. Incorporated by reference herein is Part 353, Michigan Natural Resources
and Environmental Protection Act, PA 451 of 1994, as amended.
23. Severability. If any section, clause, or provision of this Ordinance be declared
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, said declaration
shall not affect the remainder of the Ordinance. The City Commission hereby declares that it
would have passed this Ordinance and each part, section, subsection, phrase, sentence and
clause irrespective of the fact that any one or more parts, sections, subsections, phrases,
sentences or clauses be declared invalid. However, if any provision of the Ordinance is
declared invalid, the City must seek written confirmation from the DEQ that the Ordinance
still complies with Part 353, Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act,
PA 451 of 1994, as amended.

SECTION 2323: FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
The intent of the regulations in this Section is to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions.
1. Flood hazard areas shall be treated as overlay districts, which shall:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due
to water or erosion, or in flood heights or velocities.
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
d. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage.
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
2. This Section shall apply to all land which is depicted on the Flood Hazard Boundary
Map/Flood Insurance Rate Map 260161B dated June 1, 1977 as determined by the
Federal Insurance Administration. Any map amendments are hereby adopted by
reference, and Flood Hazard Districts are overlay Districts.
3. All new construction and substantial improvement to structures shall be constructed so
that the lowest floor, including basements, for residential structures shall comply with
the flood-resistant construction requirements of the Michigan Residential Code or for
-190-
non-residential buildings shall comply with the flood-resistant construction requirements
of the Michigan Building Code. [amended 7/02] [amended 4/06]
Any new and replacement water systems and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from
the system into flood waters. On-site waste disposal systems are to be located to avoid
impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
4. The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger
floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This Section shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Muskegon or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance of this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
5. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Item 3, above,
then the Zoning Administrator, shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation date available from a Federal, State, or other source.
6. Responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator shall be as follows:
a. Notify adjacent communities and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources
prior to any alteration or relocation of watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
b. Obtain necessary engineering analysis to assure that the flood-carrying capacity
with the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
c. The Zoning Administrator shall review the proposed development to assure that
all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from
which approval is required by Federal or State Law, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334.
d. For the purpose of the determination of applicable flood insurance risk premium
rate, the Zoning Administrator shall:
1) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest habitable
floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures, and determine whether or not such structures contain a
basement.
2) Obtain from a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect, certification
that the flood-proofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood
depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood so that the structure is watertight to the
base flood level.
-191-
3) Maintain a record of all such information.
7. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Zoning Administrator shall make the
necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this Ordinance.
No new construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within the zones A1-30 of the City's Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), unless it is demonstrated to the City Commission and/or Zoning Administrator
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City.

1. Intent: It is the intent of this section that off-street parking spaces shall be provided and
adequately maintained by each property owner in every district for the parking of motor
vehicles for the use of occupants, employees and patrons of each building and premise
constructed, altered, or enlarged under the provisions of this Ordinance.
2. Scope: At the time any building or structure is erected, enlarged or increased in
capacity, or a new land use is established, off-street parking spaces for new or additional
development shall be provided according to the requirements of this section and Table
IB.
3. Parking and Loading Plan Review: Whenever three (3) or more vehicle parking spaces
are required for a given use of land, plans, specifications for the construction or
alteration of an off-street parking area shall be submitted for approval by the Zoning
-197-
Administrator before a development permit is issued. Such plans and specifications
shall indicate the location, precise use of buildings, size, design, surfacing, marking,
lighting, drainage, curbing and curb cuts, entrances, exits, landscaping, and other
detailed features as required by the provisions and standards of this zoning ordinance
and other applicable laws and rules.
4. Parking Areas Existing Before the Effective Date of This Ordinance: No parking area or
parking space or loading area which exists at the time this Ordinance becomes effective
shall be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established by
this Ordinance.
5. Uses of Parking Areas: Parking spaces and loading areas shall be used exclusively for
the parking of vehicles associated with a building, structure or land use in a manner
consistent with the purpose for which it is designed. No commercial activity or selling
of any kind shall be conducted within required parking areas. Permitted temporary uses
may operate in overflow parking areas or setback areas provided no clear vision or other
safety hazard is present. Vehicles shall not be repaired, stored, or displayed for sale or
hire in parking lots unless the principal use is classified for such uses.
6. Design and Access Standards: Multi-family, commercial and industrial land use areas
shall meet the screening, landscaping, and lighting standards of this ordinance.
7. Maintenance Standards: Parking and loading areas in all districts shall be paved, marked
and defined by curbing or curb stops.
8. Maximum Parking: The maximum amount of parking permitted for any use or group of
uses shall not exceed the minimum parking requirements by more than one-third (33%)
9. Loading Space Required: In order to prevent undue interference with public use of
streets, parking lots and alleys, uses such as manufacturing, storage, warehouse,
department store, wholesale store, retail store, hotel, hospital, laundry, dairy, mortuary,
and other uses similarly and customarily receiving or distributing goods by motor vehicle
shall provide space on the premises for that number of vehicles that will be at the
premises at the same time on an average day of full use. Loading spaces shall:
a. Be provided as area additional to off-street parking space and shall not be
considered as supplying off-street parking space.
b. Not interfere with fire access.
c. Provide adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading services and be not
less than twelve (12) feet in width, twenty-five (25) feet in length, and fourteen
(14) feet in height, open or enclosed, for similar uses similarly involving the
receipt or distribution by vehicles of materials or merchandise.
d. Have access provided as directly as possible from a public street or alley and be
arranged so as to provide sufficient off-street maneuvering space.
-198-
10. Joint Use of Parking Areas: The joint use of parking facilities by two or more uses may
be allowed whenever such use is practical and satisfactory to each of the uses intended to
be served, and when all requirements for location, design, and construction are met.
a. Computing Capacities: In computing capacities of any joint use, the total space
requirement is the sum of the individual requirements that will occur at the same
time each day. If space requirements for individual uses occur at distinctly
different times, the total of such off-street parking facilities required for joint or
collective use may be reduced by the Planning Commission below the same total
of the individual space requirements.
b. Record of Agreement: A copy of an agreement between joint users shall be
provided to the City. The agreement shall include provisions which assure
continued long-term use and maintenance of the parking facility by each party,
and their successors in interest, including owners and occupants of the premises
which are served by the parking facility.
11. Dimensional Requirements: Each parking space shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet
wide by eighteen (18) feet long. Maneuvering isles shall be a minimum of twelve (12)
feet wide for one-way traffic and twenty-two (22) feet for two-way traffic. Excessively
wide isles shall not be permitted.
12. In all areas except for the downtown parking overlay district, off-street parking for
nonresidential uses shall be either on the same property or on a property zoned to permit
parking areas. The parking area shall be within three hundred (300) feet of the building
it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the building to the nearest
point of the off-street parking lot. [amended 2/03]

SECTION 2330: SITE PLAN REVIEW [amended 1/00]
It is the purpose of this Section to require site plan review approval for certain buildings,
structures, projects, and uses that can have a significant impact on natural resources,
environmental quality, traffic patterns and the character of future development. Certain land
uses possess characteristics, which can become undesirable because their intrinsic needs,
operations and/or appearance have influence beyond their own perimeter. It is hereby deemed
prudent and necessary to apply limits and guidelines which will encourage environmentally, and
economically sustainable development practices.
Site plan review shall be applied to protect property values; to protect and promote public
health, safety and general welfare by requiring access management, screening, buffering and
landscaping of sites; to preserve groundwater and respect natural water cycles; to conserve
natural features and resources; and to provide shade, conserve energy, provide visual and sound
privacy and otherwise facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious
community. The requirements contained in this Section are further intended to reduce hazards
to life and property due to fire, flooding, soil erosion, inadequate surface water drainage,
inadequate sewage disposal systems, pollution, dust, fumes, noise, vibration, noxious odors, and
other hazards, and to facilitate the provision of a system of roads, streets, parking, municipal
sewage disposal, storm sewers, municipal water supply, and other public needs.

portion of a site plan, the applicant shall have the right to review by the Planning
-207-
Commission, which shall review the site plan or portion thereof in question, applying the
same standards and method of review which is used in all planning commission site plan
reviews.
5. Staff referral: In cases where the Zoning Administrator reasonably determines that a site
plan presents problems or issues which should be reviewed for approval or rejection by
the planning commission because of area wide effects, or technical difficulties or
considerations, the Zoning Administrator may, with proper notice to the owner, refer the
matter to the planning commission for review and action in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth for all planning commission review activities by this
ordinance.

SECTION 2334: SIGNS
1. Purpose and Intent: The purpose of these requirements is to provide a framework
within which the identification and informational needs of all land uses can be
harmonized with the desires and aesthetic standards of the general public. It is a basic
tenet of this Section that unrestricted signing does not benefit either private enterprise or
the community-at-large. It is intended through the provisions contained herein to:
a. Give recognition to the legitimate needs of business, industry and other activities,
in attaining their identification and informational objectives.
b. Reflect the primary purpose of signing as being the identification of a particular
user or use on a property, but not necessarily every activity or service performed
thereon.
c. Promote signs that are visible and can be readily seen from moving vehicles with
the least amount of distraction and to prevent confusion that may cause abrupt,
unsafe vehicular maneuvers.
d. Improve the quality of community life by encouraging signs compatible with the
overall street setting and neighborhood character, appropriate and in harmony
with the principal activities and structures being served and to promote legible
signs in scale with the area in which they are seen.
e. Protect the public welfare and enhance the urban landscape by providing signs
that do not create problems due to excessive size, height, number, or movement
for users of public rights-of-way or contiguous properties.
f. Avoid excessive signing in order to give each business or use optimum visibility
to passer-by traffic and if possible, prevent urban clutter, and to prevent one sign
from blocking the view of another sign.
g. Retain property values by reducing visual blight because of such factors as
clutter, poor maintenance, and light glare.
h. Safeguard the public use and nature of streets and sidewalks for pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
i. Support and complement the land use objectives of the Master Land Use Plan
and this ordinance.
j. Place and size signs in such a way that scenic views are respected and visual
obstructions to the natural landscape are minimized.
k. Place and size signs in such a way to prevent visual obstructions in traveled
rights-of-way that may obscure traffic signs, distract motorists or impair drivers
sight lines.
-228-
l. Protect the character of the City by encouraging the design of signs that reflect
the City's favorable environment as an urban, waterfront community.

residents and visitors, and encourage signing practices that will complement the
City's character and natural environment.

the erection, construction, alteration and/or replacement of any sign; except as

from the finished grade level or curb elevation to the lowest part of such sign or a
front setback of up to ten feet.

notification from the city to the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign

signage for the site. The intent of this ordinance is that each suite, regardless of size,
access or exposure, is reasonably afforded space for both wall signage and free-standing
signage, with the amount of signage to be determined during the site plan review
process. In the case of an existing multi-suite building which would not otherwise
require a site plan review, a minor site plan review will be required in order to determine
signage needs and allotment.

ARTICLE XXV - ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS [amended 11/00]
SECTION 2500: PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this Article is to insure that the objectives of this Ordinance are fully and
equitably achieved, that a means be provided for competent interpretation of this Ordinance, that
flexibility be provided for in the strict application of this Ordinance, that the spirit of the
Ordinance be observed, public safety secured and substantial justice done.
SECTION 2501: CREATION AND MEMBERSHIP [amended 9/05] [amended 12/06]
[amended 1/07]
There is hereby established a Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA), which shall perform its duties
and exercise its powers as provided in Section 5 of Act 207 of the Public Acts of 1921, as
amended, and in such a way that the objectives of this Ordinance shall be observed, public
safety secured, and substantial justice done. The ZBA shall consist of seven (7) members
appointed by the City Commission, and shall include one (1) member of the City Commission
and one (1) member of the Planning Commission. Every member shall be a legal resident of the
City. The term of the representative of the City Planning Commission and the term of the City
Commission representative shall expire with that of his/her Planning Commission or City
Commission office. The terms of all members except the representative of the City Planning
Commission and the City Commission shall be for periods of three (3) years each. A successor
member of the ZBA must be appointed not more than one month after the term of the preceding
member has expired. The ZBA shall annually elect its own Chairman and Vice-Chairman.
The presence of four (4) members shall constitute a quorum. The ZBA shall act by resolution.
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the ZBA shall be necessary to reverse any order
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator or body, or to decide in
favor of the applicant a matter upon which they are required to pass under an ordinance, or to
effect a variation in an ordinance, except that a concurring vote of 2/3 of the members of the
board is necessary to grant a variance from uses of land permitted in this ordinance.
The ZBA may call on any other City department for assistance in the performing of its duties,
and it shall be the duty of any such department to render such assistance to the ZBA as may
reasonably be required.
A member shall disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of
interest. Failure of a member to disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member
has a conflict of interest constitutes malfeasance in office. Malfeasance shall include but not be
limited to failure of members to disqualify themselves from a vote in which that member has a
conflict of interest. The City Commission shall remove a member of the ZBA for nonperformance
of duty or malfeasance in office, upon written charges and after public hearing.
SECTION 2502: POWERS AND DUTIES
1. Interpretation
-249-
The ZBA shall interpret the zoning text or map upon application. Where the street or lot
layout actually existing, or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown on
the zoning map, the ZBA after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of
this chapter for the particular section or district in question. In case of any question as to
the location of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of
the zoning map may be made to the ZBA and a determination shall be made by the ZBA,
solely for the purpose of applying or enforcing the zoning ordinance.
2. Appeals
The ZBA shall have the power to hear and decide appeals, filed as provided in the
following section, where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error or
misinterpretation in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the
Zoning Administrator or other administrative official in the carrying out or enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter.
In exercising its powers, the ZBA, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
of Act 207 of the Public Acts of 1921 (MSA SS 5.2931 et seq.), as amended, may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as in its judgment ought to be made.
3. Nonuse or Dimensional Variances
The ZBA shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases, filed as
required by this article, such nonuse or dimensional variances from the provisions or
requirements of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest; but only in
such cases where, owing to special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property,
the literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of the chapter would cause
practical difficulty.
Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece
of property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or
by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary situation or
condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property
immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this chapter would involve practical difficulties, unnecessary to carry out
the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the ZBA shall have the power to authorize a
variance from such strict application, so as to relieve such difficulty and so that the spirit
and purpose of this chapter be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing a
dimensional variance, the ZBA may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character, and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem
necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this chapter and in the
public interest.
-250-
No such dimensional variance in the provisions of requirements of this chapter shall be
authorized by the ZBA unless the ZBA finds, beyond reasonable doubt, that all the
following facts and conditions exist:
a. That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying
to the property in question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply
generally to other properties or class of uses in the same zoning district.
b. That such dimensional variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the vicinity.
c. That the authorizing of such dimensional variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the purposes of this
chapter or the public interest.
d. That the alleged difficulty is caused by the Ordinance and has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property, or by any previous owner.
e. That the alleged difficulty is not founded solely upon the opportunity to make the
property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner.
f. That the requested variance is the minimum action required to eliminate the
difficulty.
The nature of dimensional variance applications requires detailed information on the
property that is not required or desired in interpretation or appeal applications. The
following data shall accompany all applications for a nonuse or dimensional variance:
a. A plot plan showing the property layout, the alleged difficulty, and the minimum
relief suggested for the difficulty.
4. Use Variances
The ZBA shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases, filed as
required by this article, such use variances from the provisions or requirements of this
chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest; but only in such cases where, owing
to special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the literal enforcement of
the provisions or requirements of the chapter would cause unnecessary hardship.
The purpose and intent of this Ordinance is that every landowner in the City of
Muskegon should enjoy a beneficial use of their property. A use variance is a process by
which the City evaluates the allegation that there is no beneficial use, and can provide
relief from the regulations by granting additional development potential to provide a
beneficial use of the property. It is also the intent of this Section that such relief not
increase the potential for damaging the health, safety, or welfare of future users of the
property or neighbors that might reasonably anticipated if the landowner were permitted
-251-
to engage in or construct the use proposed. Under no conditions shall a use variance be
granted unless there is a finding of no beneficial use.
No such use variance in the provisions of requirements of this chapter shall be
authorized by the ZBA unless the ZBA finds that all the following facts and conditions
exist:
a. That the property could not be used (put to a reasonable use) for the purposes
permitted in that zone district.
b. That the plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to
general neighborhood conditions.
c. That the proposed use would not alter the essential character of the area and will
not materially impair the purposes of this ordinance or the public interest.
d. That the alleged hardship is caused by the Ordinance and has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property, or by any previous owner.
e. That the alleged hardship is not founded solely upon the opportunity to make the
property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner.
f. That the requested variance is the minimum action required to eliminate the
hardship.
g. That the use variance does not permit a use specifically identified by this
Ordinance as a use excluded from the particular zone in which requested.
h. The extent to which the ordinance protect users or neighbors from threats to
health, safety and welfare shall be considered. A use that seriously threatens the
health of future residents or neighbors is not a beneficial or allowable use.
i. In no case shall a use that is a nuisance per se, or a use which in that particular
location constitutes a nuisance, be granted as a use variance. Such uses are not
legal uses of the land.
The following data shall accompany all applications for a use variance:
a. A site plan must be submitted which meets the requirements of this ordinance.
Every use variance approved by the ZBA shall require a time for completion of
improvements.
SECTION 2503: APPEALS, APPLICATIONS, FILING PROCEDURE AND FEES [amended
3/97] [amended 11/06]
An application or appeal to the ZBA in cases in which it has original jurisdiction under the
provisions of this ordinance or state law, may be taken by any aggrieved parties, including a
-252-
property owner or tenant, or by a governmental office, department, board or bureau. Such
application or appeal shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, who shall transmit the same,
together with all the plans, specifications and other papers pertaining to the application, to the
ZBA.
Such application or appeal shall specify the grounds for appeal, or reason for application, and be
accompanied by a filing fee in the amount specified in the City's Master Fee Schedule as

In the absence of a ZBA rule to the contrary, an appeal or application for interpretation to the
ZBA shall be taken by delivery to the Zoning Administrator on or before thirty (30) days after
the Zoning Administrators written decision has been delivered to the applicant. All
applications for appeals or interpretations shall specify the grounds for appeal or reason for
interpretation.
The ZBA shall decide all applications and appeals within thirty (30) days after completion of the
hearing thereon, and such decision shall become effective upon certification of the resolution of
the ZBA.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
Zoning Administrator certifies to the ZBA after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril
to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining
order which may, on due cause shown, be granted by the ZBA or by the circuit court on
application, after notice to the Zoning Administrator. The decision of the ZBA on an appeal
shall be final. However, a person having an interest may appeal to the circuit court.
No application for a variance which has been denied, wholly or partly, by the ZBA shall be
resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the last denial, except on the grounds of
newly discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions found upon inspection by the Zoning

CITY OF MUSKEGON DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE i.1
INTRODUCTION
Form Based Codes (FBC) represent a paradigm shift in the way that we regulate the built environment. This shift was
necessary because the conventional, use-based approach to zoning has been shown to be ineffective for regulating
diverse, urban, mixed-use environments.
The City of Muskegon is using Form Based Coding to achieve the vision, goals, and outcomes for downtown that were
established by previous planning endeavors conducted by the City and her citizens. These plans include the 2003
Imagine Muskegon Plan, the 2008 Downtown and Lakeshore Redevelopment Plan, and the 2015 City of Muskegon
Parking Strategy. These plans and strategies envision a downtown that is a walkable, mixed-use, urban place with a
diversity of housing choices, vibrant retail, restaurants, and services, and a mix of job opportunities.
The formal short definition of a Form-Based Code is as follows:
Form Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than
separation of uses) as the organizing principle for the code. These codes are adopted into city or county law as regulations,
not mere guidelines. Form-Based Codes are an alternative to conventional zoning.
- Form Based Codes Institute
Unlike conventional codes, FBCs use the intended form and character of a place (or context) as the organizing principle or
framework of the code (rather than use) and regulate a series of important elements not just to create a good individual building,
but rather a high-quality urban place.
The naming conventions in FBCs reflect the intended physical form and hierarchy of different places, so instead of a zone being
labeled single-family residential, it might be called Neighborhood Edge, and instead of a zone being called commercial or
mixed use, it might be called Main Street. The terms neighborhood and main street tie back to the intended physical form
or place, both of which may include a mix of uses and different building types that create vibrant walkable urbanism.
It is also important to note that while FBCs primarily regulate an intended physical form, they also regulate use secondarily. FBCs
often allow a range of uses that are carefully chosen to maximize compatibility between uses and the intended physical form
of the downtown. The use tables are simplified and categorized by use type, and clearly defined, to allow a greater degree of
administrative decision-making related to particular uses.

WHAT IS A FORM BASED CODE?
i.2 DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE CITY OF MUSKEGON
INTRODUCTION
CREATING A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE MUSKEGON FORM BASED CODE
Many plans have been completed during the last decade to re-envision downtown Muskegon. These plans provide the
foundation for the Muskegon Form Based Code. While the community-created plans provide a broad series of goals and
help to paint a community-supported vision for the future, the FBC is intended as a tool to implement that vision.
IMAGINE MUSKEGON
In 2003, the City of Muskegon completed the 2003 Imagine Muskegon Plan with the intent of developing a conceptual
design that reflected a broad range of community input and that sparked the imagination of the greater Muskegon
community. This plan established a concept design that envisioned downtown as follows:
Destination: Muskegon as a focal point for the region, offering events, services, shops, and dining, not found
elsewhere. The area should be designed so that people are attracted to the downtown for its unique blend of
entertainment, dining, and specialty stores.
Diverse and Inclusive: Downtown should be designed to accommodate various age groups, socio-economic
backgrounds, and cultural and racial heritages.
Walkable: Infrastructure shall facilitate pedestrian activity along the waterfront and through downtown. The
ambiance of the lakefront views and the context of the Heritage District should be central to this pedestrian
activity. Streetscapes should reinforce walkability with outdoor amenities and landscape.
Connected and Multi-modal: Provide interconnections so bicyclists, joggers, and walkers have attractive paths to
enjoy. Provide for alternative transportation like trolleys so that more people can share the road with cars. While
cars are accommodated downtown, they should not dominate the environment.
Livable: A mix of housing opportunities that provide choices to a wide range of people, including high-quality,
affordable apartments, condominiums, cottages, and single-family homes.
Distinctive: New development should fit in to the historic context of downtown. The pattern of development shall
have identifiable centers and edges that respect historic and contextual block structures and street networks.

2008 DOWNTOWN AND LAKESHORE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
In 2008, the City of Muskegon completed the Downtown and Lakeshore Redevelopment Plan with the intent to advance
the redevelopment and improvement of the downtown and lakeshore areas. This Plan established a clear goal (vision)
and included a series of objectives and programs to implement and achieve that vision. Additionally, the Downtown
and Lakeshore Redevelopment Plan created a Future Land Use Plan that became the foundation for the Context Area
Map (Section 2005) of the FBC.
The Plans Vision:
In 2025, downtown Muskegon and its adjoining lakefront will be an attractive and vibrant community asset with a healthy
and prosperous mix of retail, office, housing, arts and cultural institutions, and other land uses to serve the needs of
permanent residents and visitors alike. The character of Downtown developments will reflect the unique culture and
history of Muskegon and will compliment existing facilities. Downtown will have an urban feel with convenient parking,
public transportation, walkable streets, and strong connections to neighborhoods.
Selected Objectives of the Plan:
The downtown lakeshore will be redeveloped as a mixed use district including office, retail, housing, and
educational/research uses with frequent public access points and public open space.
Downtown will have strong non-motorized transportation facilities to connect destination points and provide
linkages to neighborhoods including bike paths, bike lanes, and designated bike routes on low volume roads.
Downtown will have a balanced transportation system that facilitates ease of movement with two-way streets,
mass transit, and traffic calming features to enhance pedestrian circulation and provide strong visual and physical
connections to adjoining neighborhoods.
Context sensitive architecture will be used in the development of new facilities to reflect the character of existing
buildings and the working waterfront.
Selected Programs (Implementation Steps) of the Plan:
Amend the Zoning Ordinance to provide
standards regulating architecture, site
utilization, landscaping, window coverage,
pedestrian amenities, and building form, so
new buildings integrate well with existing
structures.
Implement a shared use parking system
through incentives and zoning requirements
to increase the use of parking while
potentially reducing the quantity of
downtown surface parking required.
Transform Webster Street and Muskegon
Street into neighborhood streets with strong
pedestrian amenities.
Add a system of bike lanes where space
allows to public streets.

INTRODUCTION
CREATING A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE MUSKEGON FORM BASED CODE
MUSKEGON PARKING STRATEGY
In 2014, in anticipation of completion of this Form Based Code, the City of Muskegon commissioned a downtown parking
study to implement a series of short-, mid-, and long-term policies to address the future of downtowns parking. These
policies provided an opportunity to proactively shape the future of downtown Muskegon by:
1. Supporting commerce and economic development,
2. Creating and providing mobility choice,
3. Building quality of life and business vitality,
4. Reinforcing a wide range of lifestyle choices,
5. Optimizing access and opportunities, and
6. Promoting convenience, turnover, and predictability while being responsive to customers.
These six opportunities were based on the vision and goals of previously completed plans and led to a series of solutions
that created tools that can be implemented in order to foster a more livable and vibrant downtown. These solutions
include:
Management Based Solutions to provide effective means to gather and analyze downtown parking conditions as
they evolve, allowing the system to proactively respond to both short- and long-term trends.
Demand Based Solutions to diminish the demand for parking by reducing the number of total vehicle trips
downtown, which in turn reduces the parking required for those vehicles.
Supply Based Solutions to adjust the amount of new parking supplied by establishing a market-based approach
to setting parking standards that is consistent with desired urban densities and character while also supporting
alternative modes of transportation.
Place Based Solutions to transform the public realm from a single-mode system to a multi-mode system that can
improve the walkability of the downtown and create more mobility options and choice. These tools make it easier
for users to find parking opportunities, which improve access to existing parking and ease perceived congestion
of parking facilities.
Time Based Solutions to encourage turnover in higher demand areas and shift users with longer term parking
needs into off-street facilities or more remote locations. Factors that can influence time based tools include the
surrounding land use, time of day, and availability of supply.
Price Based Solutions to shift demands and use patterns to reduce occupancy in high demand areas and create
a market for off-street parking.

EXISTING DOWNTOWN PARKING AND LAND USE
The graphics below depict the existing land area utilized in Downtown Muskegon for parking and buildings and their relative walking distance from
the downtown center (corner of Western Avenue and Third Street). Currently parking consumes more land than buildings, leading to compromised
livability, significant gaps in the urban fabric, a degraded public realm, and loss of tax base.

INTRODUCTION
DOWNTOWN DESIGN WORKSHOP
On March 26, 2014, the City of Muskegon convened a
Downtown Design Workshop to determine the following:
Gauge level of understanding about Form Based
Codes.
Educate residents about the fundamentals of urban
design and building a great city.
Gather feedback about project boundaries and
proposed context areas.
Inform residents about current parking supply.
Prioritize project goals.
Provide participants an understanding about
walkable urbanism and the qualities of a walkable
place.
Participants were asked to rank their priorities for the City
of Muskegon Form Based Code. Below are the results, in
order of highest priority:
Facilitating higher density development/adding
new residents to the downtown.
Fostering economic development/building the
tax base for the city.
Balancing transportation modes/enhancing
choices (ie. walk, bike, transit, vehicle).
Providing access to businesses, community
attractions, and schools.
Supporting transit ridership through available
parking (park n ride).
Providing ample and affordable parking.
Project Boundaries were examined and discussed
during the Workshop. Participants identified areas to be
removed from the proposed Form Based Code boundary.
Participants also added blocks to the project area. An
example of some of the suggested modifications included:
The area between Spring and Pine Streets, south of
Muskegon Avenue was deemed as an important area to
add to the FBC boundary.
Many of the areas along Muskegon Lake, adjacent to
downtown were suggested to be removed from the
boundary.

THE PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THE MUSKEGON FORM BASED CODE
INTRODUCTION
ROTARY PRESENTATION
On January 15, 2015, the Muskegon Rotary hosted the consultant team for a presentation and overview of the Muskegon
Form Based Code.
This presentation included references to previously completed City Master Plans, the FBC process to date, and how
the code can foster the visions established by the Master Plans. Additionally, the consultants provided an overview of
changing national demographics that are impacting cities and the financial and economic benefits of building authentic
urban places. The informational session was followed by dialogue with the audience and a question and answer session
regarding the FBC. The dialogue focused on the form of the future city and its spaces - addressing the importance of
active street edges, slow traffic speeds, compact development, and building orientation.
PROJECT REVIEW MEETINGS
Monthly meetings were conducted during the development of the Form Based Code with City staff and steering
committee members. Participants varied during these meetings depending on the code content that was discussed
and included the City Planning Department, the City Engineering Department, the Community Foundation Muskegon
County, Downtown Muskegon Now, and the Muskegon Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce.
These meetings allowed staff to review the progress of the code and provide feedback regarding content and intent,
while also facilitating a broad discussion of how existing development and hypothetical development scenarios would fit
into the administration of the Form Based Code. The Project Review Meetings also included discussion of best practices,
FBC integration and administration, urban context review, and urban design and architecture content within the Form

THE DOWNTOWN GUIDING PRINCIPLES
1. Reinforce a pattern of walkable urban
neighborhoods by supporting existing walkable
neighborhoods and providing a tool to retrofit
those that are not walkable or have been
compromised;
2. Provide incentives and remove barriers for
revitalization of neighborhoods;
3. Prevent the development of incompatible
suburban development in urban areas;
4. Build upon and enhance the unique character of
each neighborhood;
5. Encourage appropriately-scaled infill and
development;
6. Provide context-sensitive design of streets and
public realms that will reinforce the walkable
urban neighborhoods; and
7. Support a range of vibrant places within the City.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD GUIDING PRINCIPLES
1. Enable neighborhood main streets to remain or
become vibrant social and commercial centers;
2. Support a diversity of urban housing choices
appropriate to the urban context;
3. Balance pedestrian comfort and placemaking
with traffic efficiency along major corridors;
4. Encourage and incubate small local businesses as
an important part of the local economy;
5. Place services within a safe, comfortable walking
distance of homes; and
6. Create a framework of well-designed streets that
are safe and secure for pedestrians and bicycles.

INTRODUCTION
HOW TO USE THE MUSKEGON FORM BASED CODE
FORM BASED CODES AND THE PUBLIC REALM
The Muskegon Form Based Code is a development regulation
(a type of zoning code) that emphasizes the physical character
of development (its form) and de-emphasizes the regulation of
land use.
The Muskegon FBC emphasize the design of the public realm
by regulating individual building character, streetscapes, and
public spaces.
The public realm is the area defined by the building walls, the
streetscape and the street.
The Muskegon Form Based Code is organized by Context Areas
(similar to conventional zoning districts), Building Types (with
Frontage Types), and Public Realm Standards (the streetscape).
These elements provide standards for the creation of a public
realm that is consistent with that envisioned for downtown
Muskegon, as outlined in the introduction to this FBC.
The Muskegon Form Base Code also regulates land use, parking
requirements, signs, and subdivision standards.
The Context Areas in the Muskegon FBC are within a Form
Based Code Area, which is the area on the City of Muskegon
Zoning Map (located in Article III, Section 300 of the City Zoning
Ordinance) that is zoned as a Form Based Code District.
The Public Realm illustration on this page indicates the
components of the public realm and also references where
each component is regulated within the Muskegon Form
Based Code.
Building Type: Section 2006 contains standards for
Building Types that describe the various forms of
buildings that are permitted as part of this Form Based
Code. Each Building Type has its own specific massing,
composition, and vertical dimension.
Building Types also offer a variety of Frontage options
that can be selected as part of the development.
Frontages define the architecture and design
components for the buildings entrance and streetfacing
facade.
Public Realm (streets): Section 2007 contains standards
for the space between the right-of-way lines, including
the sidewalk, parkway, furnishing zone, parking lanes,
and travel lanes.
Use: Section 2005 contains use requirements for
each Context Area. Context Areas are similar to
conventional land use zoning districts. Each Context
Area includes permitted Building Types, building
height, site placement, and includes permitted and
special uses.

HOW TO USE THE MUSKEGON FORM BASED CODE
START HERE: Choose one of the following three scenarios that best fits your proposed development project
I HAVE A
SPECIFIC USE
THAT I AM
CONSIDERING
FOR MY LAND
DEVELOPMENT
SECTION 2005 CONTEXT AREAS & USE
Each Context Area has uses which
are permitted, not permitted, and
conditionally permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas
that your specific parcel is located in.
Once you have determined the Context
Area, you can determine the uses that
are most appropriate within the Context
Area.
SECTIONS 2002, 2003, and 2004
Review Section 2002, Applicability and Procedures to understand the procedural requirements of the Muskegon Form Based Code.
Review Section 2003, General Provisions for regulations that apply to all projects within the Form Based Code Area.
Review Section 2005, Subdivision and Access Standards for regulations that apply to all projects within the Form Based Code Area.
SECTION 2005 CONTEXT AREAS & USE
Each Context Area has uses which
are permitted, not permitted, and
conditionally permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas
that the use you are considering is
permitted in, this will allow you to
determine the Context Areas and parcels
within the Form Based Code Area that are
most appropriate for your project.
SECTION 2004 CONTEXT AREAS & USE
Each Context Area has uses which
are permitted, not permitted, and
conditionally permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas
that the Building Type you are considering
is permitted in, this will help determine the
parcels within the Form Based Code Area
that are most appropriate for your project,
the types of uses that are permitted for
your project, and the requirements for
building site placement.
SECTION 2006 BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS
Determine which of the Building Types best
fit the building that you want to develop.
Consider required massing, composition,
vertical dimensions, appropriate building
frontages, and the Context Areas where
the Building Type is permitted when
making your decision.
SECTION 2006 BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS
Determine which of the Building Types best fit the parcel or use that you want to develop.
Consider required massing, composition, vertical dimensions, appropriate building frontages,
and the Context Areas where the Building Type is permitted when making your decision.
You will need to consult Section 2005 Context Areas and Use to determine the requirements
of building site placement.
SECTION 2007 PUBLIC REALM STANDARDS
These standards provide design guidance and establish dimensional requirements for street and streetscape attributes, include vehicular
travel lanes, on-street parking, furnishing zones, and pedestrian zones. These standards will help you determine which streets and streetscapes
are best suited to your project. While the Public Realm standard are typically associated with public investment, there may be aspects of
specific requirements (like attributes in pedestrian zones or furnishing zones) that impact your project
SECTION 2010 DEFINITIONS
Some terms for the Muskegon Form Based Code are different or have different meanings than similar terms in conventional zoning ordinances.
If you encounter terms that you are unfamiliar with, refer to this Section for more information.
SECTION 2008 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS
The Off-Street Parking Standards will help you determine the parking requirements for your project.
SECTION 2009 SIGN STANDARDS
Each Building Type has specific sign quantities and sign sizes that are relative to the Context Area where it is located. This Section will assist you
in determining the types, sizes, placement, and quantity of signs permitted for your project.

SECTION 2001 TITLE, PURPOSE, AND SCOPE
2001.00 TITLE
The following document shall be known as the City of
Muskegon Form Based Code.
2001.01 PURPOSE
The City of Muskegon Form Based Code is intended to
support redevelopment within downtown Muskegon,
including key waterfront areas and commercial districts
through the establishment of building types, frontage
types and street guidelines by creating a compact, transitoriented
development pattern that fosters walkable
corridors, mixed uses, and a diversity of residential
development. The City of Muskegon Form Based Code
reflects the desires and outcomes of the 2003 Imagine
Muskegon Plan, the 2008 Downtown and Lakeshore
Redevelopment Plan, and the 2014 City of Muskegon
Parking Strategy.
Redevelopment within the project area shall adhere
to the provisions and standards established in this form
based code in order to realize the vision set forth in the
2008 Downtown and Lakeshore Redevelopment Plan
which was subsequently adopted as part of the citys
Master Plan.
The City of Muskegon Form Based Code is a legal
document regulating building types, frontage types
and thoroughfare types wherever its Context Areas are
applied. It shall do so in conjunction with the municipal
Zoning Ordinance for areas zoned Form Based Code (FBC)
on the zoning map, by regulating land development to
ensure a compact, urban form.
2001.02 SCOPE
The City of Muskegon Form Based Code is a mandatory
code that applies to all new development and
redevelopment within the boundaries of the Zoning
Map or other locations within the municipality where the
applicable Context Areas have been applied as outlined
in 2002.00, Applicability.
The boundaries generally include all lands that abut
Muskegon Lake to the west, Spring Street to the north,
Shoreline Drive to the south, and Muskegon Avenue to the
east, as well as the 3rd Street Business District.
Within the City of Muskegon Zoning Ordinance, properties
zoned and thus regulated by the City of Muskegon Form
Based Code are within the Form Based Code (FBC) district. This
district directs property owners and applicants to this Code for
development standards. Wherever there is a conflict between
the City of Muskegon Form Based Code and other sections
of the Citys Zoning Ordinance (as applied to particular
development within the FBC district), the requirements
specifically set forth in the Form Based Code shall prevail.
For development standards not covered by the City
of Muskegon Form Based Code, the other applicable
sections in the municipal Zoning Ordinance shall apply. All
development shall also comply with all other local, state
or federal regulations and ordinances.
Throughout this Form Based Code, photographs are used
for illustrative purposes only.

The ROWHOUSE BUILDING TYPE is a small- to medium-sized attached structure that consists of 2 to 8 rowhouses placed
side-by-side. This Type is typically located within medium-density neighborhoods or in a location that transitions from
single-family to mixed-use. This Type enables well-designed higher densities. It is an essential Building Type for providing a
broad choice of housing types and promoting walkability.
The following images represent precedent examples of the Rowhouse Building Type. They are intended as examples only

The DUPLEX BUILDING TYPE is a small- to medium-sized detached structure that consists of two side-by-side or stacked
dwelling units, both facing the street and within a single building massing. This Type has the appearance of a mediumsized
single-family house and is appropriately scaled to fit in single family neighborhoods. This Type enables well-designed
higher densities. It is an essential Building Type for providing a broad choice of housing types.
The following images represent precedent examples of the Duplex Building Type. They are intended as examples only
and should be used for inspiration in the creation of this Building Type for projects within the Muskegon Form Based Code
area.

The CIVIC BUILDING TYPE is a small-, medium- or large-sized detached structure that incorporates uses of special public
importance including, but not limited to municipal buildings, churches, libraries and schools. Civic Buildings typically have less
form regulations than other Building Types because their prominence within the community requires more iconic and distinctive
form.

CITY OF MUSKEGON DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE 7.1
2007.00 PURPOSE
Section 2007 identifies Public Realm Type Standards
established for each of the Context Areas within the
City of Muskegon Form Based Code. Each of the Public
Realm Types is defined by a Public Realm Assembly which
includes the attributes which may occur within the public
right-of-way for specific Public Realms.
Attributes for each Public Realm Type include standards
for sidewalks, street tree planting, thoroughfares (vehicular
zones), on-street parking, streetscapes, and bike lanes.
These standards ensure that the Public Realm is consistent
with the desires and outcomes of the 2003 Imagine
Muskegon Plan, the 2008 Downtown and Lakeshore
Redevelopment Plan, and the 2015 City of Muskegon
Parking Strategy.
Public Realm Standards support the urban form that
is required by the Muskegon Form Based Code and
should be considered when streets and sidewalks are
reconstructed within the Form Based Code District.
2007.01 APPLICABILITY
The City of Muskegon will configure and adjust the Public
Realm Types as necessary for specific conditions. In
instances where private development participates with
the City for public realm improvements, these standards
shall be coordinated with the City of Muskegon.
2007.02 PUBLIC REALM MOBILITY CHOICE
The Public Realm and the thoroughfares that they
represent are intended to balance the needs of all types
of trafficauto, bicycle, and pedestrianto maximize
mobility and convenience for all the citizens and users of
the respective Context Areas within the Muskegon Form
Based Code District.
While the thoroughfares of all Public Realms will
appropriately balance pedestrian and automobile
needs, their character will vary by specific location.
Some thoroughfares will carry a large volume of both
automobile and pedestrian traffic and provide a more
intense urban experience while others will provide more
intimately scaled streets and public space.
The Public Realm Type Standards illustrate typical
configurations for the rights-of-way within the Form Based
Code District. The City will configure and adjust these
as necessary for specific conditions with the intent of
balancing access and mobility for all users.
When balancing this mobility choice, street design
shall consider the safety, comfort, and convenience
of pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, and motor
vehicle drivers. Balance in all types of transportation
and development of transportation infrastructure shall
accommodate all users, so that even the most vulnerable
 children, elderly, and persons with disabilities  can use
and travel safely within the public rights-of-way.
To create these balanced streets, a pedestrian-first policy
should establish modal hierarchy. This modal hierarchy
(refer to figure below) inverts the dominant, auto-based
paradigm so that downtown Muskegons transportation
network can grow safely, sustainably, and equitably into
the 21st Century.
When considering public realm improvements within
the Form Based Code District, transportation projects
and programs, from design to implementation to
maintenance, should favor pedestrians first, then transit
riders, cyclists, and finally, vehicular traffic.

7.4 DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE CITY OF MUSKEGON
PUBLIC REALM TYPE STANDARDS SECTION 2007
PROTECTED BIKE LANE
Protected bike lanes have a physical barrier or vertical separation between moving motor vehicle traffic and bicyclists.
Examples of a physical barrier or vertical separation include plastic posts, bollards, curbs, planters, raised bumps or
parked cars.
DEDICATED BIKE LANE
A bicycle lane is a portion of the roadway that has been designated by striping, signing, and pavement markings for
the preferential use of bicyclists.
SHARROW (SHARED LANE)
A shared lane marking within a vehicular travel lane of a streets surface that indicates that bicyclists may use any
portion of the full width of the travel lane.
2007.04 BICYCLE FACILITIES
Many of the Public Realm Assemblies within the Muskegon Form Based Code are intended to accommodate bicycles in
the thoroughfare (vehicular lanes). While not all Public Realm Assemblies will have bike facilities, a connected network
should be considered when redesigning or reconfiguring the downtown streets.
The Public Realm Types described in this section indicate three different levels of bicycle facilities for the thoroughfare.
These facilities are as follows and will be coordinated by the City of Muskegon when practically and technically feasible:
CITY OF MUSKEGON DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE 7.5
2007.05 PUBLIC REALM TYPE OVERVIEW
Public Realm Types for the Muskegon Form Based Code are summarized as follows:
Context Areas represented in black indicate that Public Realm Type is not typically allowed in that Context Area.
BOULEVARD
A local, slow movement thoroughfare suitable for
high intensity urban areas. Boulevards are urban
in character, with angled or parallel parking on
both sides, a center median, and narrow vehicle
travel lanes that support an urban commercial
environment. Bikes may be accommodated with
protected bike lanes, dedicated bike lanes, and/
or sharrows (shared lane with cars). Transit may also
be accommodated along these thoroughfares.
COMMERCIAL STREET
A local, slow movement thoroughfare suitable for
high intensity urban areas. Commercial Streets are
urban in character, supporting parallel parking
on both sides with narrow vehicle travel lanes
that support an urban commercial environment.
Bikes may be accommodated with protected
bike lanes, dedicated bike lanes, and/or sharrows
(shared lane with cars). Transit may also be
accommodated along these thoroughfares.
TRANSITIONAL STREET
A local, slow movement thoroughfare suitable for
medium to high intensity urban areas. Transitional
Streets are urban in character, supporting parallel
parking on both sides with narrow vehicle travel
lanes that support an urban commercial or high
density residential environment.
PARKWAY STREET
A local, slow movement thoroughfare suitable for
general urban areas. Parkway Streets are urban
in character, supporting parallel parking on one
or both sides with narrow vehicle travel lanes that
support a variety of different frontages and uses.
Bikes are accommodated with dedicated bike
lanes and/or sharrows (shared lane with cars).
ARTERIAL
A thoroughfare suitable for general urban areas
that connects to a regional transportation system.
The Arterial is less urban in character than other
thoroughfares in the Muskegon Form Based Code
District. Medium to large width vehicle travel lanes
support a variety of frontages and uses. The Arterial
Public Realm supports vehicular movement as a
first priority and should be used only in instances
where other Public Realm Types can not support a
high level of service for vehicular traffic.
WATERFRONT EDGE
In Section 2007, Muskegons downtown waterfront
is considered a public realm and acts as both
a thoroughfare for bikes and pedestrians and
as a public space for commercial, residential,
and recreational activity. The space is urban
in character with fronts of buildings and active
frontages facing the waterfront. Bikes are
accommodated with a dedicated bike lane that
connects to the citys existing and proposed bike
network.

obstructions;
E. Enable the public to locate goods, services and
facilities without excessive difficulty and confusion
by restricting the number and placement of signs;

communication, while ensuring that signs are
aesthetically designed and proportioned in

to which they are attached;
G. Recognize that the principal intent of commercial
signs is for identification of an establishment on
the premises, and not for advertising off-premises
activities; and

of their significant negative impact on traffic safety
and aesthetics.

SECTION 2010 FORM BASED CODE DEFINITIONS
10.2 DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE CITY OF MUSKEGON
Carriage House Building Type: A Building Type that is an
accessory structure typically located at the rear of a lot.
It typically provides either a small residential unit or home
office space above the first floor garage. This Type is

only be used in conjunction with the Detached House,
Duplex, Rowhouse, or Live/Work Building Types.
Civic Building Type: A Building Type that is a small-, mediumor
large-sized detached structure that incorporates uses
of special public importance including, but not limited to
municipal buildings, churches, and libraries. Civic Buildings
typically have less form regulations than other Building
Types because their prominence within the community
requires more iconic and distinctive form. Civic buildings
are typically sited in locations of prominence, such as
corners of major intersections, terminating a street vista or
overlooking or within a civic space. The design of these
Building Types is encouraged to allow greater flexibility
and distinctive architectural expression so that they
can become landmarks. In the Muskegon Form Based
Code Area, schools are not considered uses that are
appropriate for Civic Buildings.
Civic Space: An outdoor area dedicated to public
use that is strategically placed to facilitate use by the
surrounding community.
Clear Glass: Refer to Glass, Clear.
Context Area: Administratively similar to zoning districts
in conventional codes, except that they integrate formbased
elements, including Building Type, building site
placement, and off-street parking placement into the
regulation.
Cornice Expression Line: An architectural feature on
buildings that acts as an upper termination or capital for
the overall composition of the building.
Cottage Retail Building Type: A Building Type that is a
small- to medium-sized detached structure. It is intended
to provide retail or service uses at the ground floor. This
Type will typically have a residential mass, scale, and
composition that allows it to integrate into adjacent
residential areas.
Building Footprint: The shape and placement of the
ground floor of a structure on the lot or parcel.
Building Footprint, Condominium Site: The area of the
condominium site within which the main building or
structure may be constructed as described in the master
deed for the site condominium project.
Building Height: Refer to Height, Building.
Building Wall: In reference to the walls that face the rightof-
way lines along front and side streets, public paths, or
civic spaces. Specifically related to the requirements of
building site placement.
Build-To-Line: A measurement that defines the edge in
which the building walls that face front and side streets are
required to be built to. When a build-to-line is indicated
in the requirements for a Building Type frontage and / or
Context Area, it is a requirement and not a permissive
minimum as is a set back line.
Build-To-Zone: A measurement that defines the range (or
zone) in which the building walls that face front and side
streets are required to be located within. When a buildto-
zone is indicated on a Building Type frontage and / or
Context Area, it is a requirement that the building walls
are constructed within this range.
Building Type: Building Types describe the various forms
of buildings that are permitted in the City of Muskegon
Form Based Code. Each Building Type has its own specific
massing, composition, vertical dimension, and frontage
options that create its unique attributes. Building Types
are regulated in Section 2006 and are allowable within
various Context Areas.
Building Type and Frontage Zone: An element of the
Public Realm Type Standards that represents the portion
of the public realm that is defined by the building wall
at the sidewalk. It is at this edge that private-sector
development meets public-sector investment. It is also
the location where the street wall can promote activity
and vibrancy, while enhancing walkability.
C
DEFINITIONS C
Canopy: A fixed shelter projecting from and supported by
the exterior wall of a building and constructed of metal or
other rigid materials.
Canopy Sign: A sign that typically includes letters, logos,

FORM BASED CODE DEFINITIONS SECTION 2010
CITY OF MUSKEGON DOWNTOWN FORM BASED CODE 10.3
E
DEFINITIONSE
Eave: The projecting overhang along the sloped edge of
a pitched roof.
Engaged Porch Frontage: A frontage option where the
facade of the building that faces the front and / or side
streets is setback a medium distance from the front and
side streets, typically within a build-to-zone. The resulting
yard is typically small and can be defined by a fence or
hedge to spatially maintain the street edge. The engaged
porch has two adjacent sides of the porch that are
engaged to the building (connected to and enclosed by
building walls) while the other two sides are open. Steps
from the porch may be on the front or side of the porch
and shall lead directly to the sidewalk.
Expanded Tree Pit: This system is designed to provide street
trees a better environment to grow and survive in urban
contexts. The principle behind the expanded tree pit is
to approximate the growing conditions in which a tree
species has evolved. The more closely those conditions
can be achieved, the better a tree will survive and express
its genetic potential. An expanded tree pit, or shared
rooting space, may be achieved by linking individual tree
pits with an under sidewalk corridor.
F
DEFINITIONS F
Façade: Refer to Building Façade.
Fascia: Horizontal board that terminates an eave edge of
a sloped or pitched roof.
Finish Ceiling: The ceiling surface, usually installed over

Finish Floor: The floor, usually laid over a subfloor, which
provides the completed floor surface.
Flex Building Type: A Building Type that is a medium- to
large-sized attached or detached structure, typically
built on a large lot. It can be used to provide a vertical
mix of uses with ground floor industrial, service, retail, or
residential uses; or it may be a single-use building. This
Type is a primary component in a variety of urban context
areas that provide a mix of Building Types.
D
DEFINITIONS D
Dedicated Bike Lane: Refer to Bike Lane, Dedicated.
Detached House Building Type: A Building Type that
is a small- to medium-sized detached structure that
incorporates one dwelling unit. It is typically located within
a primarily single-family neighborhood in a walkable urban
setting. This Type enables well-designed higher densities.
It is an essential Building Type for providing a broad choice
of housing types. Synonymous with single-family house.
Departure: A Minor or Major modification to selected Form
Based Code requirements, refer to Section 2002, Tables
2002.03a and 2002.03b.
Dooryard Frontage: A frontage option where the facade
of the building that faces the front street is setback a small
distance from the street, typically within a build-to-zone.
The front property line is oftentimes defined by a low wall,
fence, or hedge, creating a small dooryard. The dooryard
shall not provide public circulation along the rights-ofway.
The dooryard may be raised or at-grade and is most
often intended for ground floor residential.
Drive-through Frontage: A frontage option that is
identical to the Storefront Frontage, however it includes
an automobile drive-through at the rear or non-street
facing sides. The drive-through may include a covered
structure at the service window location. This structure
is designed to be a secondary element to the building
and is consistent with the massing, scale, and design of
the building. This frontage is typically associated with
retail and mixed-use buildings and includes a storefront
that is designed in a way that promotes an attractive and
convenient shopping experience.
Drive-through Zone: The area (or zone) in which a drivethrough
is permitted to be placed on a site. Drive-through
zones are part of requirements of the Drive-Through
Frontage.
Duplex Building Type: A Building Type that is a small- to
medium-sized detached structure that consists of two sideby-
side or stacked dwelling units, both facing the street
and within a single building massing. This Type has the
appearance of a medium-sized single-family house and is
appropriately scaled to fit in single family neighborhoods.
This Type enables well-designed higher densities. It is an
essential Building Type for providing a broad choice of
housing types. Synonymous with two-family house.

Structural Soil: Part of street tree planting requirements in
Public Realm Standards (Section 2007). Structural Soil is a
designed medium that can be compacted to pavement
design and installation requirements while permitting root
growth. It is a mixture of gap-graded gravels (made of
crushed stone), clay loam, and a hydrogel stabilizing
agent to keep the mixture from separating. It provides
an integrated, root penetrable, high strength pavement
system that shifts design away from individual tree pits.
T
DEFINITIONS T
Terrace: A component of the lightwell frontage that is
elevated above the adjacent grade in order to provide
a landing and access to the first floor from the sidewalk.
Typically used in association with a lightwell. Refer to
Lightwell definition. Note that the term Terrace is also
associated with its own frontage type (refer to definition
for Terrace Frontage). The term terrace is also used in
the City of Muskegon to reference the landscaped area
between the sidewalk and curb along a street. The
Muskegon Form Based Code refers to this area as either
a parkway or as the Sidewalk Furnishing and Tree Zone in
the Public Realm Standards.
Terrace Frontage: A frontage option where the facade of
the building that faces the front street is set back from the
right-of-way line to accommodate an elevated terrace.
The terrace provides circulation along the facade. This
Frontage Type can be used to provide at-grade access
while accommodating a grade change. Frequent steps
up to the terrace are necessary to avoid dead walls
and maximize access. This frontage may also be used
in historic industrial areas to mimic historic loading docks.
This frontage type is conditionally permitted to be used
when buildings are along a sloped grade that limits at
grade access. When the frontage is used on Mixed-Use
Building Types and Retail Building Types, it is required to
have a storefront.
Terrace Leading Edge: The street side (side closest to
street) of the Terrace Frontage wall on Mixed Use and
Retail Building Types. This side of the wall is required to be
placed at the property line (build-to-line).
Thoroughfare: An element of the Public Realm Type
Standards that represents the area of the right-of-way
that is dedicated to vehicular movement.
Transom: A small horizontal window located above the
storefront and entry door to allow light or air into the retail
building.
Transparency: The ability to see through with clarity.
An opening in a building wall allowing light and views
between interior and exterior through the use of clear
glass. Only clear or lightly tinted glass in windows, doors
and display windows is considered clear. Heavily tinted
glass or reflective glass shall not be considered clear.
Interior display shelves and merchandise are not allowed
to obstruct views into or out of any windows, doors or
display areas that are considered part of the transparency
calculation. Windows, doors and display areas provide
clear views into and out of the building. Transparency
is integral to the relationship of buildings and the street
because of the permeable edge and dialogue that it
creates between the interior and exterior of buildings.
Refer to Glass, Clear.
Tree Pit, Traditional: In an urban context, the space in the
ground where a tree is planted. Traditionally, tree pits are
5 foot square or less and covered by tree grate (or more
recently a permeable surface surrounding the tree). Best
practices for the long term growth and sustainability of
the urban street tree is to include an expanded tree pit as
part of the planting strategy.
Tree Pit, Expanded: An expanded pit, or shared rooting
space for urban plantings may be achieved by linking
individual pits with a corridor at least 18 deep and 4 wide
of suitable soil blended into the site soil to avoid boundaries
of soil discontinuity. The principle behind the expanded
tree pit is to approximate the growing conditions in
which a tree species has evolved. The more closely those
conditions can be achieved, the better a tree will survive
and express its genetic potential. Expanded tree pits are
typically sub-surface (with only a traditional tree pit and
tree visible at the sidewalk). Expanded tree pits may be
above surface in the form of raised planters in less urban
intense areas.
