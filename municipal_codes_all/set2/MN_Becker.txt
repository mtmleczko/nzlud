§3.36
SECTION 3.36 TRUNK WATER, SEWER, AND STORM SEWER CHARGES
Subd. 1. Purpose. In furthering the fiscal management strategies of the city and in an
effort to have growth pay its own share, the establishment of trunk facility charges reduces the
burden on taxpayers to support that growth. The establishment of Trunk Facilities
Charges places the burden of the costs of growth on those who wish to use city utilities.
Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 2. Definitions:
A. “Sewer Trunk Facilities”. Those facilities that are considered necessary for the proper
operation of a sewer system but having a significant role in serving the system as
opposed to a sewer main serving individuals properties. For purposes of this section of
the code, sewer trunk facilities include; lift stations, force mains, larger pipes than
needed for the development itself generally considered sewer mains which exceed 8
inches, extra depth of sewer lines generally considered in excess of 20 feet, jacked or
bored highway or railroad crossings, river crossings, laterals without services, and land
and easements costs for utilities. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
B. “Water Trunk Facilities.” Those facilities that are considered necessary for the proper
operation of a water system but having significant role in serving the system as
opposed to a water main serving individual properties. For purposes of this section of
the code water trunk facilities include; wells and pump houses required as a result of
new development, water towers, booster pump stations, larger pipes than needed for the
development itself- generally considered water mains which exceed 8 inches, jacked or
bored highway or railroad crossings, laterals without services, and land and easement
costs for utilities. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
C. “Storm Sewer Trunk Facilities.” Those facilities that are necessary for proper
drainage, which are beyond the need for individual areas. These systems typically link
drainage areas (conveyance) or to provide storage, treatment, or disposal of storm
drainage. For purposes of this section of the code these systems include; detention and
retention ponds, sedimentation basins, pond liners, storm sewer piping in excess of that
needed to serve the development in which they are installed, and land and easement
costs for utilities. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
D. “Leap Frog or Leapfrogging.” A term used to describe the jumping over of one
property to get to the next parcel. Used in the context of this section, a developer may
intend on leapfrogging over a parcel to develop a parcel not immediately abutting a
parcel already served by municipal utilities. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
E. “Wastewater Treatment.” Means the processing of the sanitary sewer waste stream
for disposal and shall include all portions of the system not identified as trunk facilities
defined in this section. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
§3.36
Subd. 3. Basis for Trunk Charges. Trunk charges will be charged on all properties
based on a per acre charge. This charge shall be on a gross acre basis for water and sewer
and on a net acre basis for storm sewer. In calculating the net cost for the storm sewer,
property acreage for parkland, streets, storm sewer basins and wetlands will be deducted to
determine a net acreage amount. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 4 . Areas to be Charged Trunk Charges. Those areas that are within the
corporate city limits and those properties known as the Oak Savanna (County owned) at the
time of adoption of this ordinance shall not be subject to trunk facilities charges. All other
areas brought into the city shall be required to pay charges at the current rate at the time of
development. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 5. Charges. A Trunk Facilities Charge shall be made for each of the following
utilities: water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer. The charges shall be established and
adjusted by resolution. Charges shall be adjusted on an annual basis for inflation and actual
growth conditions experienced by the city. The amount of the charge shall be set from time
to time by resolution of the council. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 6. Trunk Funds. A separate fund shall be established as a revolving Trunk Facilities
Fund in each of the categories described.
A. Sanitary Sewer Revolving Trunk Fund. Funds will be used to pay for trunk
system expansions and improvements, as described in definitions above. Ordinance 70, 2nd
Series, Effective May 11, 2002
B. Water Revolving Trunk Fund. Funds will be used to pay for trunk system
improvements as described above. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
C. Storm Sewer Revolving Trunk Fund. Funds to be used to pay for trunk conveyance
systems, storage, and treatment of storm drainage. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11,
2002
Subd. 7. Payment. Payment of the trunk charges for residential developments shall be
negotiated at the time of a development agreement. Payment for commercial and industrial
development shall be paid at the time of the building permit issuance. Commercial and Industrial
development shall pay the charge based on the amount of property actually to be developed,
including appropriate green space and setbacks. As the property develops with subsequent
improvements, charges will then be incurred for the additional space developed and payment shall
be made at the time of subsequent building permits. When the property develops up to or exceeds
85% of the total parcel acreage the payment for trunk facilities shall be paid in full. Ordinance 70, 2nd
Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 8. Orderly Development. Development shall occur in an orderly fashion.
Properties that abut parcels served by municipal utilities will be considered as the next feasible
property for development. Given the high costs of trunk facilities the city may limit development
activities to selected areas. Petitions to expand in areas not already under development will be
considered but a decision to expand utilities rests with the city. Factors that will be considered
§3.36
include, among other things, capacity in the wastewater treatment facility, well capacity, number of
developments under construction and capacity of staff to deal with the requested development.
Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 9. Leapfrogging. Any developer who wishes to develop a parcel that would require
a leapfrog of a property would be subject to all costs associated with that leapfrog. Costs would
include, but are not limited to, all piping, including trunk and easements to get to the property to be
served for the development. The developer shall be afforded no credit or reimbursements for these
costs. The property that was jumped over will be required to pay for all trunk charges for the
property regardless of the facilities installed when developed. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11,
2002.
Subd. 10. Credits against Trunk Facilities Charges. The developer shall be given a
credit for any Trunk Facility installed within their development. The credit shall be for the cost of
the trunk facility as determined by the city engineer. In the event of over sizing or extra depth, a
cost differential shall be used to determine the credit. Bid pricing shall not be the sole determinate
in defining a developer credit. The city engineer shall be the sole determine any credit for a given
project. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 11. Onsite Storm Sewer Systems. Systems installed to provide for site
coverage of impervious surfaces in excess of 50% in commercial and industrial properties shall
not be used as credit in any way. The use of these additional facilities is for the sole benefit of
the property owner. Ordinance 70, 2nd Series, Effective May 11, 2002
Subd. 12. Feasibility Studies. Any developer who requests extensions of trunk facilities,
that are not part of their development, shall be required to pay for the feasibility study determine
extent, options, and costs of proposed trunk facilities to serve the development. Source: Ordinance 70,

investigation if the investigation is to be conducted within the state, and $10,000, less any
amount paid for the initial investigation, if the investigation is required outside the state.

SEC. 5.29. SOCIAL HOST RESTRICTIONS
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings. The Becker City Council intends to hold persons
criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcohol. The Becker City Council finds that:
A. Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or
consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one are harmful to those persons and
constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.
B. Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general
public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcoholrelated
traffic collisions.
C. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on
those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of the irresponsible user.
D. Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur
outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are
present and condone the activity and in some circumstances provided the alcohol.
E. Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult
to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption.
F. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting
an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products, electronic

started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been
shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial
burden on all levels of government; this ordinance shall be intended to regulate the sale,

SECT. 6.25 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings.
A: Purpose. It he purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in
order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Becker, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the harmful location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City of Becker. The provisions
of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimatize the
disbursement of obscene material.
B. Findings Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses
on the community presented in hearing and in reports made available to the Council, and
on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Northend
Cinema, Inc. v. Seattle, 585 P.2d 1153 (Wash. 1978), and on studies in other
communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin,
Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Beaumont, Texas; and also
on findings found in the Report of Attorney General’s Working Group on The Regulation
Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 16,1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
1. Sexually oriented business in the City of Becker lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators
of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the
owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
2. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance as
adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incident of certain types of sexually
oriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments.
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at sexually
oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths
or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows, as defined under this
ordinance as adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, adult
motion picture theaters, or adult arcades.
§6.25
4. Offering and providing such space, encourages such activities, which create
unhealthy conditions.
5. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually
oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such
sexually oriented businesses.
6. At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in
sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea,
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non
A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
7. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part,
because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the
unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators
of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
8. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the
burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of Becker. It is appropriate to
require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the
sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and
activities occurring therein.
9. Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information
regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the
incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of
potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such
establishments.
10. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to

SEC. 10.09. POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT SERVICE FEES FOR FALSE
ALARM RESPONSE
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations for the billing
of fees for a response to a false alarm. The intent is to reduce the number of false alarms
occurring within the City and the resultant waste of City resources by providing for corrective
administrative actions including fees.
Subd. 2. Applicability. This code shall include only non-residential establishments
within the City of Becker.
Subd. 3. Definitions. The following terms, as used in this Section, shall have the
meanings stated:
A. Alarm Dispatch Request. Notification to a law enforcement agency or fire
department that an alarm, either manual or automatic, has been activated at a particular
alarm site.
B. Alarm Site. A single fixed premise, building, structure, facility, or location served by
an alarm system. Each tenant’s space within a multi-tenant building or complex, if
served by a separate system, shall be considered a separate alarm site.
C. Alarm System. Devices including, but not limited to, systems interconnected with a
radio frequency method such as cellular or private radio signal, arranged to emit or
transmit a remote or local audible, visual, or electronic signal indicating an alarm
condition to which police or fire personnel are expected to respond. These may include,
but not limited to, fire, burglary, holdup, and panic alarm systems. Alarm systems to
monitor temperature, carbon monoxide, humidity, medical emergencies, or any other
condition not related to the detection of a fire or criminal intrusion into an alarm site or
an attempted robbery at an alarm site are specifically excluded from the provisions of this
code. Alarm systems installed on a vehicle or persons are also excluded unless the alarm
is permanently affixed to a specific location. Periodic alarm testing is excluded when
sufficient notice is given to the Police or Fire Departments.
D. False Fire Alarm. The activation of any fire alarm system which results in a dispatch
of the fire department caused by mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation,
lack of proper maintenance or any other response for which the fire department personnel
are unable to determine the apparent cause of the alarm activation, or by which
negligence or intentional misuse of the fire alarm system by the owner, its employees,
agents or any other activation of a fire alarm system not caused by heat, smoke or fire.
False fire alarms do not include alarms caused by climatic conditions such as tornadoes,
§10.09
thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, violent conditions of nature, or any other conditions
which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer, installer or owner.
E. False Police Alarm. An alarm signal eliciting notification to and a response by
police personnel where the responding police officer, having completed a timely
investigation of the alarm site, is unable to find any evidence of a crime or attempted
crime and which is caused by the activation of the alarm system through mechanical
failure, alarm malfunction, improper installation, or the inadvertence of the owner or
lessee of an alarm system, or of such owner or lessee’s employee’s or agents, or by
service technicians. False police alarms do not include alarms caused by climatic
conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, violent conditions of
nature, or any other conditions which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm
manufacturer, installer, or owner.
F. Non-Residential. Those establishments not identified under the residential
definition.
G. Residential. Single or multifamily housing units that are used, serve, or are
designed as a place of residence.

1st Response $0 $0
2nd Response $0 $0
3rd Response $0 $0
4th Response $50 $100
5th Response $100 $200
6th Response or more $200 $400
Subd. 5. Payment of Fees. Payment of fees provided for herein shall be paid to the City
within 30 days from the date of notice by the city to the alarm user. Failure to pay the fee within
30 days of notice will cause the alarm user to be considered delinquent and subject to a late
payment penalty equal to ten (10) percent of the false alarm fee.
Payments not made within 60 days will be considered delinquent. All delinquent charges and
penalties shall be certified by the City Clerk to the County Auditor each year providing for
assessment of the delinquent amounts against the property of the delinquent alarm user.
§10.09
Subd. 6. Corrective Action. After the third such police/fire response to a false alarm,
the appropriate agency designee will meet with the alarm user to discuss the cause for such false
alarm and the corrective actions to be taken to help mitigate the chance for future responses.
Subd. 7. Response to Alarms by both Fire and Police. The Police Department is
typically dispatched to all alarms, more so to investigate the cause of activation of the alarm. At
times, both agencies will respond to alarms when deemed necessary. In the case where both
agencies are dispatched and respond to an alarm, the Fire Department will keep tally for that
event and track it as one of the three (3) allowable such responses within the twelve (12) month
tally period. In the case where the Fire Department does not respond, the Police Department will
tally the event in a similar manner.
Subd. 8. Right to Notice and Appeal.
A. Notice. Written notice shall be provided to all alarm users notifying them of all
false alarm responses to the premises and their status as a chargeable fee. The alarm user has
the right to request an informal hearing before the Chief of Police, Fire Chief, or their designee
to appeal the false alarm fee. The request must be in writing and filed with the Chief of Police or
Fire Chief within 10 days of the false alarm notice.
B. Appeal. Anyone aggrieved by the decision of the Chief of Police, Fire Chief, or
designee to affirm the false alarm fee may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a
written request for an appeal within ten (10) days of the date of the decision. The decision of the
City Council is final.
Subd. 9. Exceptions. Prior notification of activation of a new system is requested to
both the Fire and Police Departments to receive the exemption. There is a thirty (30) day grace
period for all newly installed alarm systems. All false alarms during this period shall not be
considered part of the three (3) allowable alarms within a twelve (12) month period. The
installation date must be verified by a dated sales receipt for the alarm system, or stated invoice
from the installer of the alarm system.
The provisions of this ordinance are not applicable to alarm systems affixed to automobiles, boat
trailers, house trailers, and recreational motor vehicles. Periodic testing is granted with prior
notification to the Police and Fire Departments.
Subd. 10 Enforcement. Failure or omission to comply with this ordinance shall be
deemed a petty misdemeanor. Source: Ordinance 131 2nd Series, Effective Date: September 6th, 2008.

SEC. 10.20. SHADE TREE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.
Subd. 1. Policy and Purpose. The City has determined that the health of oak, elm and ash
trees are threatened by fatal diseases known as Oak Wilt and Dutch Elm, and invasive pest
infestation, as in Emerald Ash Borer. It has also been determined that the health of many tree
species may be threatened by diseases and infestation of an epidemic nature. It has further been
determined that the loss of oak, elm, ash and other trees threatened by epidemic diseases and/or
infestation on public and private property would substantially depreciate the value of property and
impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is declared to be the
intention of the Council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases and infestations, and
provide for the removal of dead, infested or diseased trees, as nuisances.
Subd. 2. Definitions. The following terms, as used in this Section, shall have the meanings
stated:
A. "Shade Tree Disease" - Dutch Elm disease, Oak Wilt disease, or any other tree disease
of an epidemic nature as declared by the City Council.
B. “Invasive Pest Infestation” – Emerald Ash Borer or any other tree infestation of an
epidemic nature as declared by the City Council.
C. "City Forester" - The Public Works Director, or such other employee of the City as the
Council may designate and who shall thereafter qualify.
D. "Nuisance"
(1) any living or standing tree infected to any degree with a shade tree disease or
invasive pest infestation; or
(2) any logs, branches, stumps or other parts of any dead or dying tree, so infected,
unless such parts have been fully burned or treated under the direction of the
City Forester.
Subd. 3. Scope and Adoption by Reference. Minnesota Statutes, Section 18.023, is
hereby adopted by reference, together with the Rules and Regulations of the Minnesota
Commissioner of Agriculture relating to shade tree diseases and invasive pest infestation; provided,
that this Section shall enlarge such Statutes, Rules and Regulations in such circumstances where the
Code is more restrictive.
Subd. 4. Unlawful Act. It is unlawful for any person to keep, maintain or permit, upon
premises owned by him or upon public property where s/he has the duty of tree maintenance, any
nuisance as herein defined.
§10.20
Subd. 5. Inspection, Diagnosis and Abatement. It is the power and duty of the City
Forester to enter upon public or private property at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting
for, and diagnosing, and if necessary, abating shade tree disease or invasive pest infestation. In the
case of suspected shade tree disease or invasive pest infestation, and in performance of his duties,
the City Forester may remove such specimens or samples as may be necessary or desirable for
diagnosis.
Subd. 6. Abatement of Nuisance. Abatement of a nuisance, defined herein, shall be by
spraying, removing, burning, or otherwise effectively treating the infected tree or wood to prevent
spread of shade tree disease or invasive pest infestation. Such abatement procedures shall be carried
out in accordance with current technical and expert methods and plans as may be designed by the
Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of Minnesota. The City shall establish specifications for
tree removal and disposal methods consistent therewith. Such standards shall be kept on file in the
office of the City Forester and shall be revised from time to time based on current research.
Subd. 7. Procedure for Removal of Infected Trees and Wood.
A. Whenever the City Forester finds, with reasonable certainty, that the infection or danger
of infection, exists in any tree or wood on any public or private property, s/he shall
proceed as follows:
1. If the City Forester finds that the danger of infection of other trees is not imminent
because of dormancy of shade tree disease or invasive pest infestation, s/he may
choose to re-inspect said tree either later the same growing season or at the
beginning of the following growing season. If at that time the tree has not
recovered, the City Forester shall proceed by abating the nuisance as a public
improvement under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 429.
2. If the City Forester finds that danger of infection of other trees is imminent, s/he
shall notify the owner of the property by certified mail that the nuisance will be
abated by a specific time, not more than twenty (20) days from the date of receipt
of such notice. After the expiration of the notice the City Forester may abate the
nuisance.
3. If the City Forester finds with reasonable certainty that immediate action is
required to prevent the spread of shade tree disease or invasive pest infestation,
s/he may proceed to abate the nuisance forthwith. The City Forester shall upon the
completion of the nuisance abatement, ascertain the cost attributable to each lot.
The City Administrator or City Clerk shall certify to the County Auditor/Treasurer
of Sherburne County a statement of the amount of the cost incurred by the City.
Such amount together with interest shall be entered as a special assessment against
such lot or parcel of land and be collected in the same manner as real estate taxes.

work done for which assessments are to be made starting and certifying the
description of the land, lots, parcels involved and the amount chargeable to each.
Ordinance 48 2nd Series, Sept. 9, 2000; Ordinance 61 2nd Series, Aug.21, 2001
5. On or before September l of each year, the City Administrator or City Clerk shall
list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot or parcel

SEC. 10.42 HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS.

unlicensed, unregistered or inoperable motor vehicles, household furniture, furnishings
or appliances, or parts or components thereof, or metal, wood, glass, paper, rubber,
concrete, or other material, whether organic or inorganic, can facilitate the growth or
spread of noxious weeds, the nesting and breeding of rodents, insects, and harmful
bacteria, and be a threat of fire. The Council also finds that unless such accumulation is
stored in a lawfully operated Junk yard, housed within a lawfully erected building, or in
a container permitted, and the contents disposed of, under provisions of the City Code, it
is a source of filth, cause of sickness, and an immediate danger to the health, safety and
welfare of persons and property in the City. The Council finds that if such unauthorized,
unwholesome and dangerous accumulation is permitted to continue to pose such a threat
it is a hazardous condition and a nuisance, must be abated, and that this Section is
adopted to protect the residents of the City and their property and, in addition, to protect
the rights of persons who may be found in violation of its provisions. "Accumulation"
that term is used in this Subparagraph A, means prohibited items in any number or
amount.
B. Business Premises. The Council finds that accumulation upon premises to which the
public has access or may be exposed of food particles or other material causing
discomfort to patrons, or disrepair of seating, floor covering, plumbing, heating, or
electrical facilities, or failure to maintain a reasonable standard of cleanliness and
absence of noxious odors, can facilitate the nesting and breeding of rodents, insects, and
harmful bacteria and is a source of filth, cause of sickness, and an immediate danger to
the health, safety and welfare of persons and property in the City. The Council finds
that if such unauthorized, unwholesome and dangerous accumulation is permitted to
continue to pose such a threat it is a hazardous condition and a nuisance, must be abated,
and that this Section is adopted to protect the residents of the City and their property
and, in addition, to protect the rights of persons who may be harmed in violation of its
provisions. "Accumulation" as that term is used in this Subparagraph B, means
prohibited items or conditions in any number or amount.
Subd. 2. Unlawful Acts and Enforcement.
A. It is unlawful to park or store any unlicensed, unregistered or inoperable motor vehicle,
household furniture, furnishings or appliances, or parts or components thereof, or scrap

§10.47
SEC 10.47. PREDATORY OFFENDER RESIDENCE RESTRICTION
Subd. 1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this ordinance is to establish
predatory offender residency regulations similar to the predatory offender regulations that have
been promulgated by various Minnesota cities to allow the City of Becker to have regulations
and protections in effect for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens during the City’s study
and planning activities related to the possible enactment of permanent predatory offender
residence regulations. The most common predatory offender residence regulations have
prohibitions of residencies within certain distances of places and areas where children are known
to congregate.
Subd. 2. Findings
1. Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual
offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who represent an extreme threat
to public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to
repeat their offenses, and most such predatory offenders have committed many more
offenses and have many more victims than are ever reported or prosecuted. The cost
of predatory offender victimization to society at large, while not precisely calculable,
is significant.
2. It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the City’s compelling interest to promote,
protect and improve the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens by establishing areas
around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers,
wherein certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residences.
3. The Council has determined that it is necessary and in the public interest to impose an
ordinance limiting the residence location of sexual predatory offenders within the
city.

section 6.
Subd. 6. Penalty and Enforcement. A violation of this Ordinance shall be a

any other appropriate remedy in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Sections 10.48 through 10.98, inclusive, reserved for future expansion.)
§10.99
SEC. 10.99. VIOLATION A MISDEMEANOR. Every person violates a section,
subdivision, paragraph or provision of this Chapter when s/he performs an act thereby prohibited or

1. Uses Without Water-oriented Needs. Uses without water-oriented needs must
be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots
or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal
ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from
the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
§11.65
D. Design Criteria for Structures
1. High Water Elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with any flood
plain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the
elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or floodproofed
must be determined as follows:
• For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet above the
highest known water level. Or three feet above the ordinary high water
level, whichever is higher;
• For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above
the flood of record, if data area available. If data are not available, by
placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary high water
level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of
proposed construction upon flood stages and food flows and to establish
a flood protection elevation. Under all three approaches, technical
evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist
consistent with parts of 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the
management of flood plain areas. If more than one approach is used, the
highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for placing
structures and other facilities; and
• Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed
lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and
wind-driven waves and debris.
2. Water-oriented Accessory Structures. Each lot may have one water-oriented
accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in Section 5.2.2 of
this ordinance if this water-oriented accessory structure complies with the
following provisions:
• The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height, exclusive of
safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet.
Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point;
• The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level
must be at least ten feet;
• The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from
public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased
setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;
§11.65
• The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be enclosed or
used as a storage area;
• The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation
and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities; and
3. Stairways, Lifts, and Landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative
to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down steep slopes
to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements;
• Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on residential lots.
Wider stairways may be used for, public open-space recreational properties,
and planned unit developments;
• Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not exceed 32 square
feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for, public
open-space recreational properties, and planned unit developments;
• Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or lands;
• Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on
posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and
built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
• Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually
inconspicuous portions of lots as viewed from the surface of the public water
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
• Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped
persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that
the dimensional and performance standards of sub-items (1) to (5) are
complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations,
Chapter 1340.
4. Significant Historic Sites. No structure may be placed on significant historic site
in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about
the site has been removed and documented in a public repository.
5. Steep Slopes. The Zoning Administrator must evaluate possible soil erosion
impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit
for construction of, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep
slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued
permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of
structures, vehicles and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public
waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation.
E. Height of Structures
All structures in residential districts, except churches and nonresidential agricultural
structures, must not exceed 25 feet in height.
§11.65
F. Shoreland Alterations
Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into public
waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank
slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
G. Vegetation Alterations
1. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and the
construction of roads and parking areas regulated by Section 5.9 of this
ordinance are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
2. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest
management uses as regulated in Sections 5.11 and 5.12, respectfully, is allowed
subject to the following standards:
• Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore impact zones and on
steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest
land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is
developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district in
which the property is located
• In shore impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and
shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to
provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas,
access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and water craft access
areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities,
provided that:
a) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions, is not substantially reduced;
b) Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is
preserved; and
c) The above provisions are not applicable to the removal
of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or
pose safety hazards.
H. Topographic Alterations/Grading and Filling
1. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures,
and driveways under validly issued construction permits for these facilities do
not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the
grading and filling standards in this Section must be incorporated into the
issuance of permits for construction of structures, and driveways.
§11.65
2. Public roads and parking areas are regulated by Section 5.9 of this ordinance.
3. Notwithstanding Items 5.8.1 and 5.8.2 above a grading and filing permit will be
required for:
• The movement of more than ten (10) cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore impact zones; and
• The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of steep
slopes and shore impact zones.
4. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the
issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use
permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
• Grading or filling in any type 2,3,4,55,6,7, or 8 wetland must be evaluated to
determine how extensively the proposed activity would affect the following
functional qualities of wetland*:
a) Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
b) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood
damage;
c) Fish and wildlife habitat;
d) Recreational use;
e) Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
f) Note worthiness, including special qualities such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants
and animals, or others
*This evaluation must also include a determination of
whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires
permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or federal
agencies such as a watershed district, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources, or the United States Army
Corp of Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
• Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only
the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible;
• Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for temporary
bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be established as
soon as possible;
• Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach
any surface water feature must be used;
§11.65
• Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service;
• Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that cerates an
unstable slope;
o Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be
reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and
must not create finished slopes of 30 percent or greater;
o Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters
must first be authorized by the commissioner under Minnesota
Statutes, 103G.245;
o Alterations of topography must only he allowed if they are accessory
to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties; and
o Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the
shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the
ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet.
5. Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose is
connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors,
must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may
be given only after the commissioner has approved the proposed connection to
public waters.
I. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways, and Parking Areas
1. Public roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of natural
vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from
public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that
all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control
erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water for conservation district, or other applicable technical
materials. Ordinance 193 2nd Series, Effective Date: October 9, 2017
2. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and must not
be placed within-shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible
§11.65
placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within
these areas, and must be designed to minimize and adverse impacts.
3. Public and private water craft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related
parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative
screening and erosion control conditions of this subpart are met. For private
facilities, the grading and filling provisions of Section 5.8 of this ordinance must
be met.
J. Storm Water Management
The following general and specific standards shall apply
1. General Standards:
• When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and vegetated
soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water
runoff before discharge to public waters.
• Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be
stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods
used to retain sediment on the site.
• When development density, topographic features and soil and vegetation
conditions are no sufficient to adequately handle storm water runoff
using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways, and drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried
pipes and man-made materials and facilities.
2. Specific Standards
• Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of the lot
area.
• When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are
designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of
the local soil and water conservation districts.
• New constructed storm water out falls to public waters must provide for
filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris
before discharge.

without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with
public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal
ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from
view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions.
2. Agriculture Use Standards
• General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming,
sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes
and shore-impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or

provisions of the Minnesota Non-point Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the
provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management “Best Management Practices in
Minnesota”.
§11.65
1. Extractive Use Standards
• Site Development and Restoration Plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved, and
followed over the course of operation of the site. The plan must address
dust, noise, possible pollutants discharges, hours and duration of operation,

93.51, shall be a permitted use provided the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Sections 93.44
to 93.51, are satisfied.
N. Conditional Uses
Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas shall be subject to the review and approval
procedures, and criteria and conditions for review of conditional uses established communitywide.
The following additional evaluation criteria and conditions apply within shoreland
areas:
1. Evaluation criteria. A thorough evaluation of the water body and the
topographic, vegetation, and soils conditions on the site must be made to ensure:
• The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public waters,
both during and after construction;
• The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed form public waters
is limited;
• The types, uses and numbers of water craft that the project will generate are
compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to safely
accommodate these water craft.
2. Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The Becker City Council, upon
consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, shall
attach such conditions to the issuance of the condition use permits as it deems
necessary to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance. Such conditions may include,
but are not limited to, the following:
§11.65
• Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
• Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement that
additional vegetation be planted; and
• Special provisions for the location, design, and use of, water craft launching
and docking areas, and vehicle parking areas.
Subd. 6 Non-Conformities
All legally established non-conformities as of the date of this ordinance may
continue, but they will be managed according to applicable state statutes and other
regulations of this community for the subjects of alterations and additions, repair
after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of use; except that the
following standards will also apply in shoreland areas.
A. Construction on non-conforming lots of record.
1. Lots of record in the office of the county recorder on the date of
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements
of Section 5.1 of this ordinance may be allowed as building sites without
variances from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the
zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting
lands at all times since it became substandard, was created compliant
with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage treatment and
setback requirements of this ordinance are met.
2. A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use,
or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the
board of adjustment shall consider sewage treatment and water supply
capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if
adequate facilities cannot be provided.
3. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership,
any individual lot does not meet the requirements of Section 5.1 of this
ordinance the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for
the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the
one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land,
each meeting the requirements of Section 5.1 of this ordinance as much
as possible.
B. Additions/expansions to non-conforming structures
1. All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing
non-conforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other
§11.65
requirements of Section 5.0 of this ordinance. Any deviation from these
requirements must be authorized by a variance pursuant to Section 3.3.
2. Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not
meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all
of the following criteria and standards are met:
• The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established;
• A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable
location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water
level setback of the structure’
The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not
exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary
high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
• The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screened.
C. Non-Conforming sewage treatment systems.
a) A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of Section 5.3.1 of this
ordinance must be upgraded, at a minimum at any time a permit or variance of
any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the
purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
non-conforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system’s
improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
b) The governing body of the City of Becker has by formal resolution notified the
commissioner of its program to identify non-conforming sewage treatment
systems. The City of Becker will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming
system identified by this program within a reasonable period of time
which will not exceed 2- years. Sewage systems installed according to all
applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minnesota
Statutes, Section 105.485 [now 103F.201-.221] in effect at the time of
installation may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be
failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other
deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation above
groundwater than required by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s
Chapter 080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered
non-conforming.
§11.65
Subd. 7 Subdivision/Platting Provisions
A. Land Suitability
Each lot created through subdivision, including planned unit developments
authorized under Section 8.0 of this ordinance, must be suitable in its natural state
for the purpose use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by the local unit for

feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of
future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
B. Consistency with other controls.
Subdivisions must conform to all official controls of this community. A subdivision
will not be approved where a later variance from one or more standards in office
controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose.

provide easements over natural drainage or ponding areas for management of storm water and
significant wetlands.
E. Platting
All subdivisions that create five or more lots or parcels that are 2-1/2 acres or less in size shall
be processed as a plat in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 505. No permit for
construction of buildings shall be issued for lots created after these official controls were
enacted unless the lot was approved as part of a formal subdivision
F. Controlled Access or Recreational Lots.
Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or for recreational use areas for use by
nonriparian lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the sizing criteria in Section 5.14 of
this ordinance.
Subd. 8. Planned Unit Developments (PUD’s)
A. Types of PUD’s Permissible
Residential Planned unit Developments (PUD’s) are allowed for new projects on
undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built sites, or conversions of existing
buildings and land. The land use districts in which they are an allowable use are
identified in the land use district descriptions in Section 4.2 of this ordinance and the
official zoning map.
B. Processing of Residential PUD’s
Residential Planned unit developments must be processed as a conditional use, except
that an expansion to an existing residential PUD involving 6 or less new dwelling units
or sites since the date this ordinance was adopted is permissible as a permitted use
provided the total project density evaluation procedures in Section 8.5. Approval cannot
occur until the environmental review process (EAW/EIS) is complete.
C. Application for a Residential PUD
• The applicant for a PUD must submit the following documents prior to
final action being taken on the application request:
§11.65
• A property owners association agreement (for residential PUD’s) with
mandatory membership, and all in accordance with the requirements of
Section 8.6 of this ordinance.
• Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other
instruments that:
1. Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations,
construction of additional buildings, beaching or watercraft; and
2. ensure the long-term preservation and maintenance of open space
in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in Section
8.6 of this ordinance.
• Those additional documents as requested by the Zoning Administrator
that are necessary to explain now the residential PUD will be designed
and will function.
D. Site “Suitable Area” Evaluation
Proposed new or expansions to existing planned unit developments must be
evaluated using the following procedures and standards to determine the suitable
area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in Section 8.5.
1. The projected parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines
approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the
following intervals, proceeding landward:
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Sewered
Natural environment lakes 320
All river Classes 300
2. The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier
area all wetlands, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters.
E. Residential PUD Density Evaluation
The procedures for determining the “base” density of a residential PUD and density increase
multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other
tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer.
1. Residential PUD “Base” Density Evaluation:
• The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size
standard for lakes or for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the
tier depth, Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the
residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier, density,
and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in Section 8.6.
§11.65
2. Density Increase Multipliers:
• Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously
determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in Section 5.0 are met or
exceeded and the design criteria in Section 8.6 are satisfied. The allowable
density increases in Item B. below will only be allowed if structure setbacks
from the ordinary high water level are increased to at least 50 percent greater
than the minimum setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an
equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional
means acceptable to the City of Becker and the setback is at least 25 percent
greater than the minimum setback.
• Allowable Dwelling Unit or Dwelling Site Density Increases for Residential
Planned Unit Developments:
Density evaluation tiers Maximum density increase
Within each tier (percent)
First 50
Second 100
Third 200
Fourth 200
Fifth 200
F. Maintenance and Design Criteria
1. Maintenance and Administration Requirements
• Before final approval of a planned unit development, adequate provisions
must be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open
spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the development.
• Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and
permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and
maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the
following protections:
a. Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUD’s)
b. Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
c. Construction of additional buildings or storage of
vehicles and other materials prohibited; and
d. Uncontrolled beaching of water craft prohibited
• Development organization and functioning. Unless and equally effective
alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
§11.65
residential planned unit developments must use an owners association with
the following features;
• membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers;
• each member must pay a pro rata share of the association’s expenses,
and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites;
• assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing conditions;
and
• the association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
2. Open Space Requirements
Residential Planned unit developments must contain open space meeting all of
the following criteria:
• At least 50 percent of the total projected area must be preserved as
open space
• Dwelling units or sites, road right-of-way, or land covered by road
surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented
accessory structures or facilities are developed areas and shall not be
included in the computation of minimum open space;
• Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable
for development in their natural state, and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
• Open spaces may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by
owners of dwelling units or sites, b y guests staying in commercial
dwelling units or sites, and by the general public
• Open space may contain water-oriented accessory structures or
facilities;
• The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation,
and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance,
or other equally effective and permanent means; and
• The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be
included as open space. For residential PUD’s at least 50 percent of
the shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70
percent of the shore impact zone area of new developments must be
preserved in its natural or existing state.
§11.65
3. Erosion Control and Storm water Management.
Erosion control and storm water management plans must be developed and the
residential PUD must:
• Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the likelihood of
serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This must
be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare
ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment
facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be
used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion
control plans approved by a soil and water conservation district may be
required if project size and site physical characteristics warrant; and
• Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected
quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed 25 percent of the tier area.
4. Centralization and Design of Facilities
Centralization and design of facilities and structures must be done according to the
following standards:
• Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups and
located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and
located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the
relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level,
elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks
from the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with
Section 8.53 of this ordinance for developments with density increases;

SECTION 11.66 DISTRICT FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
TWO DISTRICT – ONE-MAP FORMAT
Subd. 1.0 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose
1.1 Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of
the City of Becker, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
1.2 Findings of Fact:
1.21 The flood hazard areas of the City of Becker, Minnesota, are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
1.22 Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based upon a reasonable
method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
1.23 National Flood Insurance Compliance. This Ordinance is adopted to comply with the
rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of
Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
1.3 Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 1.21 by
provisions contained herein.
Subd. 2.0 General Provisions
2.1 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of Becker, Minnesota shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the
attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway and Flood Fringe
Districts.
2.2 Establishment of Official Zoning Map: The Official Zoning Map together with all
materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Sherburne
County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein
numbered 27141C0220, 27141C0240, 27141C0310, and 27141C0330, all of these
documents being dated November 16, 2011 and prepared by the Federal Emergency
§11.66
Management Agency. The official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City
Clerk and the Zoning Administrator.
2.3 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any
increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
2.4 Interpretation:
2.41 In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to
be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing
Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by
State Statutes.
2.42 The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the
Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions
and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of
Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on
elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on
the site at the time the Community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date
of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year
floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location
of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to
the Board of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
2.5 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
2.6 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside
the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Becker,
Minnesota or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
§11.66
2.7 Severability: If any Subdivision, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
2.8 Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance
shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage
and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.
2.811 Accessory Use or Structure - a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
2.812 Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor
or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of
excavation below ground level.
2.813 Conditional Use - means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and
with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls
or building codes and upon a finding that:
(a) Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
(b) The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one
exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
2.814 Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of
conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
2.815 Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a
wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
2.816 Flood Frequency - the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood
stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
2.817 Flood Fringe - that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood
fringe is synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in the Flood Insurance
Study,
Sherburne County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas.

watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
§11.66
2.819 Flood-Proofing - a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments
to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or
elimination of flood damages.
2.820 Floodway - the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to carry or
store the regional flood discharge.
2.821 Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor.
2.822 Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more Subdivisions,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
“manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle”.
2.823 Obstruction - any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile
refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede, retard, or change the
direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water.
2.824 Principal Use or Structure - means all uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
2.825 Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area,
the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would
most typically constitute a reach.

or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily
not for the use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purpose of this Ordinance,
the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel
vehicle.
§11.66
2.827 Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used
in a flood insurance study.
2.828 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation - The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the
regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on
the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
2.829 Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories,
sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles
not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Subdivision 9.31 of this
Ordinance and other similar items.
2.830 Substantial Damage – means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
2.831 Substantial Improvement – within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair
after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.” For
the purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure” shall be defined in 44
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
2.832 Variance – means a modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as
applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical
§11.66
difficulty or unique circumstances as defined and elaborated upon in a
community’s respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
2.9 Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into
Subdivision 2.2 above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the
corporate boundaries of the City of Becker at the time of adoption of this
ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of
Becker, Minnesota after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed
floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately
upon the date of annexation into the City of Becker, Minnesota.

3.2 Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with
the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts, all uses not
listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Subdivisions 4.0, 5.0 that follow, respectively,
shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that:
3.21 New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain travel trailers
and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this Ordinance and
specifically Subdivision 9.0.
3.22 Modifications, additions, structural alterations normal maintenance and repair or repair
after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures
or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Ordinance and specifically
Subdivision 11.0.

exemptions and provisions of Subdivision of Section 9.3 of this Ordinance.
§11.66
4.38 Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to
any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where
the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than
the 10-year frequency flood event.
4.4 Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
4.41 All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and
levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be
allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or
regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
4.42 All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards
contained in Section 10.4 of this Ordinance.
4.43 The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
4.44 Fill:
(a) Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain
shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable
method.
(b) Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway
unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an
erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
(c) As an alternative, and consistent with 4.44 (b) immediately above, dredge spoil disposal
and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other
materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional
flood but only after the Governing Body has received an appropriate plan which assures
the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The Conditional Use Permit must be title registered with the property in the
Office of the County Recorder.
4.45 Accessory Structures:
(a) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
§11.66
(1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis
parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same
flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(c) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in
accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the State Building
Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or
FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory
structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its
largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely
for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed accessory structures must
meet the following additional standards, as appropriate:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls;
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than
one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
4.46 Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the
area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan
approved by the Governing Body.
4.47 Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section
of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota
§11.66
Statute, Chapter 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to
remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
4.48 A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to
the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance
or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
Subd. 5.0 Flood Fringe District (FF)
5.1 Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted
uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts
exist, then any residential or non residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a
permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District
"Permitted Uses" listed in Subdivision 5.2 and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in
Subdivision 5.5.
5.2 Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
5.21 All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest
floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot
below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such
elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected
thereon.
5.22 As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal
investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be
internally flood proofed in accordance with Subdivision 4.45 (c).
5.23 The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of one-thousand
(1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in
accordance with Subdivision 5.21 of this ordinance.
5.24 The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
5.25 The provisions of Subdivison 5.5 of this Ordinance shall apply.
5.3 Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance
with Subdivison 5.21-5.22 or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in
Subdivision 5.23-5.24 shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a
§11.66
conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures
specified in Subdivision 5.4-5.5 and 10.4 of this Ordinance.
5.4 Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
5.41 Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a
structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These
alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or
above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or
floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's
basement or lowest floor if: 1) if the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side
of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification - The structure's design and as-built condition must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance
with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that
all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating
within these components during times of flooding.
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to
internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used
as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on
at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a
minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic
openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters
without any form of human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code
and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
5.42 Basements, as defined by Section 2.812 of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the
following:
§11.66
(a) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with
Subdivision 5.43 of this Ordinance.
5.43 All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the
structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally
dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the
State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification
shall not be permitted.
5.44 When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is
located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel
operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control
works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community
is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a
state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used
to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional
flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional
engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the Governing Body. The plan
may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the flood
plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5.45 Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from
the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a
plan approved by the Governing Body.
5.46 The provisions of Subdivision 5.5 of this Ordinance shall also apply.
5.5 Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:
5.51 All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not
more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to
this requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the
period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after
§11.66
determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response
procedures exist.
5.52 Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots
may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a
permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be
granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when
multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number
exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
5.53 Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize interference
with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations.
Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in Subdivision 5.52 above. In considering permit
applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business
requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
5.54 Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use
of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the
100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction
and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These
standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5.55 Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the
channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where
a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning
Map.
5.56 Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 9.3.
5.57 All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.

§11.66
Subd. 7. 0 Subdivisions
7.1 Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of
flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within
the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the Floodway
District at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have
water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance and
have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than
two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood
plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
7.2 Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year
flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
Subd. 8.0 Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads, and Bridges
8.1 Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water
supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in accordance with the
State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
8.2 Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within
the flood plain shall comply with Subdivision 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance. Elevation to the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these
transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of
transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
8.3 On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems: Where public utilities are not
provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage
treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system
designed in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this Subdivision.
§11.66
Subd. 9.0 Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Parks and Placement of
Recreational Vehicles.
9.1 New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home parks shall
be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by Subdivision 7.0 of this Ordinance.
9.2 The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing manufactured home
parks or on individual lots of record that are located in flood plain districts will be treated
as a new structure and may be placed only if elevated in compliance with Subdivision 5.0
of this Ordinance. If vehicular road access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not
provided in accordance with Subdivision 5.51, then replacement manufactured homes will
not be allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the Governing Body.
9.21 All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.
9.3 Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in Section 9.31
below shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance and as specifically spelled out in
Subdivision 9.33-9.34 below.
9.31 Exemption - Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this
Ordinance if they are placed in any of the areas listed in Section 9.32 below and
further they meet the following criteria:
(a)Have current licenses required for highway use.
(b) Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, are
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in
campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the recreational vehicle has no
permanent structural type additions attached to it.
(c) The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any
pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
9.32 Areas Exempted For Placement of Travel/Recreational Vehicles:
(a) Individual lots or parcels of record.
(b) Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
(c) Existing condominium type associations.

occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 dollars for a structural addition to the recreational
vehicle or exceeding $500 for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage
building. The recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures
§11.66
will then be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/flood
proofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in Subdivision 4.0 and
5.0 of this Ordinance. There shall be no development or improvement on the parcel or
attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of the recreational
vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
9.34 New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion of any
existing similar use exceeding five (5) units or dwelling sites shall be subject to the
following:
(a) Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in the Floodway or
Flood Fringe Districts provided said recreational vehicle and its contents are placed on
fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation and proper elevated road access to
the site exists in accordance with Subdivision 5.51 of this Ordinance. No fill placed in
the floodway to meet the requirements of this Subdivision shall increase flood stages of
the 100-year or regional flood.

in Subdivision 2.831(b) of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the provisions of Subdivision 11.11
– 11.15 of this Ordinance.
11.11 No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases
its nonconformity.
11.12 Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming
use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or use
shall be protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in accordance with any
of the elevation on fill or flood proofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 thru FP-4 flood proofing
classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in
11.13 and 11.16 below.
11.13 The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure over
the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
unless the conditions of this Subdivision are satisfied. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction material and a
reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the cost of all previous and proposed
alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then
the structure must meet the standards of Subdivision 4.0 or 5.0 of this Ordinance for new
§11.66
structures depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe

Ordinance and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected
violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or
development, the Zoning Administrator may order the construction or development
immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the Community. If
the construction or development is already completed, then the Zoning Administrator
may either: (1) issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within
a specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls; or (2) notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30-days.

§11.70
SEC. 11.70. SIGNS.
Subd. 1. Findings. The City Council hereby finds as follows:
1. Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the
environment.
2. Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages.
3. Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments to
property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare.
4. The city’s zoning regulations include the regulation of signs in an effort to
provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic
viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its
citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character
that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and
threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community. The regulation
of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive
impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.
Subd. 2. Purpose and Intent. It is not the purpose or intent of this sign ordinance
to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of this article to
regulate any building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be
viewed from outside a building. The purpose and intent of this article is to:
1. Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other physical
characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
2. Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the city by
preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community.
3. Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective
means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics.
4. Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set
forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.
§11.70
Subd. 3. Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the
city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations. The effect of this sign
ordinance, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
1. Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial and industrial zones, and
a more limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set
forth in this sign ordinance.
2. Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal use of a
site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this sign
ordinance.
3. Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other physical
characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on
the environment and the public health, safety and welfare.
4. Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this sign ordinance.
Subd. 4. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Sign Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions of this Sign Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would
have adopted the Sign Ordinance in each section, subsection, sentence or phrase thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases
be declared invalid.
Subd. 5. Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this Sign
Ordinance, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
Abandoned Sign – Any sign and/or its supporting sign structure which remains without a
message or whose display surface remains blank for a period of one (1) year or more, or any sign
which pertains to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies, shall be deemed to have been
abandoned. Signs applicable to a business temporarily suspended because of a change in
ownership or management of such business shall not be deemed abandoned unless the property
remains vacant for a period of one (1) year or more. Any sign remaining after demolition of a
principal structure shall be deemed abandoned. Signs which are present because of being legally
established nonconforming signs or signs which have required a conditional use permit or a
variance shall also be subject to the definition of abandoned sign.
Awning – A roof-like cover, often of fabric, plastic, metal or glass designated and intended for
protection from the weather or as a decorative embellishment, and which projects from a wall or
roof of a structure primarily over a window, walk, or the like. Any part of an awning which also
projects over a door shall be counted as an awning.
§11.70

SEC.11.72 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS
Subd. 1 Purpose. Regulations governing solar energy systems are established to provide
for appropriate locations for solar energy systems, to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses,
and to promote safe and effective use of solar energy to increase opportunities for generation of
renewable energy.
Subd. 2 Definitions. As used in this section, the following words shall mean:
1. “Building-Integrated Solar Energy System” – A solar energy system that is an
integral part of a principal or accessory building, rather than a separate mechanical
device, replacing or substituting for an architectural or structural component of the
building. Building-integrated systems include but are not limited to active
photovoltaic or hot water systems that are contained within roofing materials,
windows, walls, skylights, and awnings, or passive systems that are designed to
capture direct solar heat.
2. “Building-mounted Solar Energy System” – A solar energy system affixed to a
principal or accessory building.
3. “Freestanding Solar Energy System” – A solar energy system with a supporting
framework that is placed on, or anchored in, the ground and that is independent of
any building or other structure. Garages, carports or similar structures that incorporate
building-integrated or building-mounted solar energy systems shall not be classified
as freestanding solar energy systems and shall instead be subject to regulations
governing accessory structures.
4. “Solar Collector Surface” – Any part of a solar energy system that absorbs solar
energy for use in the system's transformation process. The collector surface does not
include frames, supports, and mounting hardware.
5. “Solar Energy” – Radiant energy received from the sun that can be collected in the
form of heat or light by a solar collector.
6. “Solar Energy System” – A device or structural design feature intended to provide
for collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for heating or cooling,
electricity generating, or water heating.

districts, subject to the standards of this article. Solar collector surfaces and all mounting
§11.72
devices shall comply with the minimum yard requirements of the district in which they
are located. Screening of solar collector surfaces shall not be required.
B. Building-Mounted Solar Energy Systems.
1. Notwithstanding the height limitations of the zoning district, building mounted solar
energy systems shall not extend higher than three (3) feet above the ridge level of a
roof on a structure with a gable, hip, or gambrel roof and shall not extend higher than
ten (10) feet above the surface of the roof when installed on flat or shed roof.
2. The solar collector surface and mounting devices for building-mounted solar energy
systems shall be set back not less than one (1) foot from the exterior perimeter of a
roof for every one (1) foot that the system extends above the parapet wall or roof
surface, if no parapet wall exists, on which the system is mounted. Solar energy
systems that extend less than three (3) feet above the roof surface shall be exempt
from this provision.
3. All solar energy systems using a reflector to enhance solar production shall minimize
glare from the reflector that affects adjacent or nearby properties. Measures to
minimize nuisance glare include selective placement of the system, screening on the
north side of the solar array, modifying the orientation of the system, reducing use of
the reflector system, or other remedies that limit glare.
C. Freestanding Solar Energy Systems.
1. Freestanding solar energy systems, measured to the highest point of the system, shall
not exceed the height of the principal structure or twenty (20) feet, whichever is less.
Freestanding solar energy systems shall be located in the side or rear yard and subject
to the minimum yard requirements of an accessory structure. Freestanding solar
energy systems greater than sixteen (16) feet in height shall be subject to the
minimum yard requirements of a principal structure. The required yard shall be
measured from the property line to the closest part of the structure at minimum design
tilt.
2. In the residential and commercial districts, the area of the solar collector surface of
freestanding solar energy systems shall not exceed five (5) percent of the lot area.
3. The supporting framework for freestanding solar energy systems shall not include
unfinished lumber.
4. All abandoned or unused freestanding solar energy systems shall be removed within
twelve (12) months of the cessation of operations.

zoning district, the City shall require that a sufficient portion of such land be set aside and dedicated
to the public for parks, schools, playgrounds, or other public use exclusive of property dedicated for
streets and other public ways. This is pursuant to Minnesota Statute 462.358. It shall be presumed
that a sufficient amount of land has been dedicated for parks, schools, and playgrounds for the
present and future residents of the subdivision if the subdivider dedicates at least ten (10%) percent
of the land in the subdivision. The City upon consideration of the particular type of development
proposed in the subdivision or land rezoned, may require larger or lesser amounts of land to be
dedicated if it determines that the present and future residents of the subdivision or development
would require greater or lesser amounts of land for such purposes. The City shall be the sole
determinant in requiring the land dedication or requiring a per dwelling unit cash payment. The
amount of this fee shall be determined by the City Council as part of the annual schedule of fees and
charges. The fees shall be due by the developer at the time of entrance into a development
agreement. If the property is rezoned the fee shall be required at the time of the building permit
payment when the property is developed.
Subd. 2. Other Dedications. In commercial, Industrial, or other Nonresidential
subdivisions the City may decide not to require the subdivider to contribute land, cash or any
combination thereof. In those instances, however, where the City deems it in the public interest to
require a contribution, the subdivider shall dedicate five (5) percent of the undeveloped land or half
of the per dwelling unit fee as established in Subd. 1.
Subd. 3. Findings of Facts for Dedications. It shall be deemed to be in the public interest
to require land dedication, cash contribution, or any combination thereof when the Council after
review and recommendation makes one or more of the following findings of fact:
A. All or part of the proposed subdivision has been designated as park, playground, public
open space, storm sewer holding areas or ponds on as adopted City Plan.
B. Such contribution is necessary in order to protect adjacent land uses from potential
conflicting land used which could exist on the land subdivided.
C. The increased number of residents to reside or be employed within the subdivision will
increase the recreational demands upon the City.
D. Such contribution is necessary to provide proper surface water run-off generated by the
uses proposed within the subdivision.
§12.50
E. The land proposed to be subdivided contains or borders upon existing unique
topographical features including but not limited to ponds, lakes, streams, timber stands,
water holding areas, hills, steep slopes, drainage areas, or bluffs which should be
preserved to prevent foreseeable safety, pollution, or erosion hazards or to provide unique
recreational and aesthetic qualities and enjoyment to the City.
F. Such contribution is necessary to comply with or fulfill the goals, policies, and programs
of the City.
Subd. 4. Exceptions for Outlots. In subdivisions which include outlots for future
development or outlots within a subdivisions that are designed specifically for other purposes, the
subdivider shall contribute land, cash, or any combination thereof as provided herein, whichever is
applicable as well as the following criteria:
A. For land contributions, the entire subdivision, including the land within the outlots will be
included in the determination of the total land dedication percentage.
B. When deemed necessary by the City for cash contributions only that land exclusive of the
outlots will be included in the determination of the total land dedication percentage.
Subd. 5. Delayed Contribution. Upon petition by the subdivider, the Council may approve
a delay in actual contribution of the cash required in lieu of land until such time a development
occurs on the property being subdivided provided that a proper legal agreement is executed
guaranteeing such contribution. Delayed contribution payment shall include eight (8) percent
interest per year.
Subd. 6. Geographic location of Dedications. In such cases where the subdivider is
required to dedicate land area the Council shall have the right to determine the geographic location
and configuration of said dedication. The land dedicated shall not consist primarily of wetland,
steep slopes or other natural or man made features that make the property unusable as parkland.

CHAPTER 13, RIGHT-OF-WAY REGULATION
Right of Way Management
Sec. 13.01. Findings, Purpose, and Intent.
To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its
streets and the appropriate use of the rights of way, the city strives to keep its rights of way in
a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code relating to right of way permits
and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and
maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights of way or to be placed therein
at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal
agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights of way will bear
financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-ofpocket
and projected costs from persons using the public rights of way.
This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123,
substantially codified in Minn. Stat. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086
(the “Act”) and 2017 Minn. Laws, ch. 94, art. 9, amending the Act, and the other laws
governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right of way. This chapter shall also be
interpreted consistent with Minn. R. 7819.0050–7819.9950 and Minn. R., Ch. 7560 where
possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the
Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory
and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police
powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public. Additionally, this chapter along with all other state, federal
and other local law establishes policy for use of city-owned infrastructure and city managed
public rights of way to enable the city to:
1) Permit fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to the available capacity on cityowned
infrastructure located within the public right-of-way to the extent permitted by
law;
2) Safeguard the reliability and integrity of city-owned infrastructure located in the public
right-of-way to the extent permitted by law;
3) Comply with applicable federal, state and local regulation as applied to city-owned
infrastructure and city managed public rights of way.
4) Support cost-effective, optimal use of public resources and support economic
development to the extent permitted by law;
5) Manage the public right-of-way to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
Sec. 13.02. Election to Manage the Public Rights of Way
Pursuant to the authority granted to the city under state and federal statutory, administrative
and common law, the city hereby elects, pursuant to Minn. Stat. 237.163 subd. 2(b), to
manage rights of way within its jurisdiction.

shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not
including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force
majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under Section 1.17.
Subd. 5. Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right of way in the manner and
to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration
required by the city, the city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay
to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right of way. If permittee
fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance
bond.
§13.15
Sec. 13.15. Joint Applications.
Subd. 1. Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the
right of way at the same place and time.
Subd. 2. Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation,
which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation
permit fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the
portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
Subd. 3. With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation
performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a
single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation
portions of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required.
Sec. 13.16. Supplementary Applications.
Subd. 1. Limitation on Area. A right of way permit is valid only for the area of the right of way
specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit,
except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that
specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area
(i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii)
be granted a new permit or permit extension.
Subd. 2. Limitation on Dates. A right of way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the
permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided
herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit
end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new
permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous
permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date.
§13.17
Sec. 13.17. Other Obligations.
Subd. 1. Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining a right of way permit does not relieve
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all
fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply
with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minn. Stat. §§
216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. R., ch. 7560. A permittee
shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and
regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right of way pursuant to its permit,
regardless of who does the work.
Subd. 2. Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right of
way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.
Subd. 3. Interference with Right of Way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right of way that
the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right of way may not be parked
within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The
loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless
specifically authorized by the permit.
Subd. 4. Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing
trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional Drilling,
shall follow all requirements set forth in Minn. Stat. Ch. 216D and Minn. R., Ch. 7560 and shall
require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as
determined by the director.
Sec. 13.18. Denial or Revocation of Permit.
Subd. 1. Reasons for Denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements
and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the public or when necessary to protect the right of way and its
current use.
Subd. 2. Procedural Requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be made in
writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must notify the applicant or rightof-
way user in writing within three business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If
an application is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by
the city and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of
the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The city must approve or
deny the resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.
§13.19
Sec. 13.19. Installation Requirements.
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right
of way shall be done in conformance with Minn. R. 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other
applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minn. Stat., §§
237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with
Minn. R., ch 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those
requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements
referenced in Section 13.23 subd. 2 of this ordinance.
Sec. 13.20. Inspection.
Subd. 1. Notice of Completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance Minn. Rule 7819.1300.
Subd. 2. Site Inspection. Permittee shall make the work site available to the city and to all
others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and
upon completion of the work.
Subd 3. Authority of Director.
(a) At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
(b) The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to
the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.
Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the
director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 13.23.
§13.21
Sec. 13.21. Work Done Without a Permit.
Subd. 1. Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any
event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to
Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement.
Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city will
attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to
the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
Subd. 2. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first
having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right of way must subsequently
obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the
other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the right of way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
Sec. 13.22. Supplementary Notification.
If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later or ends sooner than the date
given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
§13.23
Sec. 13.23. Revocation of Permits.
Subd. 1. Substantial Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right
of way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of
any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(a) The violation of any material provision of the right of way permit.
(b) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right of way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens.
(c) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right of way permit.
(d) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the
permittee’s control.
(e) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 13.20.
Subd. 2. Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any
condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such
violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place
additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification
of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure
the breach. Permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or
permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement
the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one (1) full year. Icon
Subd. 4. Cause for Probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of
conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on
probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time
period or working on right of way grossly outside of the permit authorization.
Subd. 5. Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a
breach as outlined above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency
repairs.
Subd. 6. Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse
the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection
and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
§13.24
Sec. 13.24. Mapping Data.
Subd. 1. Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping
information required by the city in accordance with Minn. R. 7819.4000 and 7819.4100.
Within ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the
permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps
and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and
equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system,
when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and
drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s
registration.
Subd. 2. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service
laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. R. 7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require
the permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of
installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the
director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the
director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations.
Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and
Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for:
a) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including
those under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, and
b) city approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan
approval under Minn. Stat. ch. 462. The director shall reasonably determine the
appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide
prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the
revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending
permittee or its subcontractors.
§13.25
Sec. 13.25. Location and Relocation of Facilities.
Subd. 1. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other
applicable law, and with Minn. R. 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules
do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
Subd. 2. Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other agreement
between the applicable right of way user and the City, Facilities in the right of way must
be located or relocated and maintained underground in accordance with Section 4.10
of the City Code.
Subd. 2. Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right of way, or any particular
segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current
technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right of way. All excavation,
obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position at variance with the corridors
established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of
the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right of way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant.
Subd. 3. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right of
way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or
taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right of way to a useable condition.
Subd. 4. Limitation of Space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when
necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit
or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such
decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of
year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined
to be in the public interest.
§13.26
Sec. 13.26 Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. 216D.01-.09 (“One Call
Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right of way excavation, each
registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than twenty
(20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the
excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
Sec. 13.27. Damage to Other Facilities.
When the city does work in the right of way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or
move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early
as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right of way which it or its facilities
damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by
that registrant’s facilities.
Sec. 13.28. Right of Way Vacation.
Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right of way that contains the facilities of a registrant,
the registrant’s rights in the vacated right of way are governed by Minn. R. 7819.3200.
Sec. 13.29. Indemnification and Liability
By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or
permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn.
Rule 7819.1250.
Sec. 13.30. Abandoned and Unusable Facilities.
Subd. 1. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a
portion of its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the
registrant’s obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been
lawfully assumed by another registrant.
Subd. 2. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of way shall remove
it from that right of way if required in conjunction with other right of way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.
§13.31
Sec. 13.31. Appeal.
A right of way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has
had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. §
237.163, subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the director regarding Section 1.24, subd.2 of
this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon
written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its
next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right of way user has submitted its appeal with
sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written
findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
Sec. 13.32 Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers
A permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and
enforce general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
Sec. 13.33. Severability.
If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this
chapter precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by
law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

Chapter 20 LISTING OF UNCODED ORDINANCES IN EFFECT
All ordinances described in this Chapter remain in effect after adoption of the
City Code. They are of a permanent and continuing nature as authority for a specific act
which has been performed. These ordinances are of two types, that generally distinguish
them from other provisions of the City Code, either
(1) their texts have no continuing reference value, or

For these reasons it appears justified to list and describe them here only to
facilitate finding them in the event this becomes necessary.
