PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of East Lansing, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code, as supplemented through December 31, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the (index itself or indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

Sec. 2-81. - Findings. 
    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of East Lansing that all officials and employees must avoid conflicts between their private interests and those of the general public whom they serve. To enhance the faith of the people and the integrity and impartiality of all officials and employees of the city, it is necessary that adequate guidelines be provided for separating their roles as private citizens from their roles as public servants. Where government is based on the consent of the governed, every citizen is entitled to have complete confidence in the integrity of his or her government. Each individual official, employee, or advisor of government must help to earn, and must honor that trust by his or her own integrity and conduct in all official duties and actions.

(9)  To protect to the fullest extent possible the rights of all individuals who are subject in any way to the provisions of this division. 
(b)  This division is intended to establish the policy that city officials and employees and their relatives shall avoid any action which might result in or create the appearance of: 
(1)  Using public employment or office for private gain; 
(2)  Giving or accepting preferential treatment to or from any organization or person; 
(3)  Impeding city efficiency or economy; 
(4)  Losing complete independence or impartiality of action; 
(5)  Making a city decision outside official channels; 
(6)  Affecting adversely the confidence of the public or integrity of the city government; or 
(7)  Giving or accepting preferential treatment in the use of city property. 
(c)  The code of ethics is intended to be preventative and nonpunitive. It should not be construed to interfere with or abrogate in any way the provisions of any Michigan statutes, the City Charter, the City Code, or any collectively bargained agreement. 
(d)  This declaration of policy is not intended to prevent any city official or employee of the city from receiving compensation for work performed on his or her own time as a private citizen and not involving city business.

No city council member, city official, or employee shall interfere with the ordinary course of law enforcement within the city, and no special favors, consideration, or disposition shall be suggested to or requested of any law enforcement person of the city including city manager, police chief, police officers, code enforcement officers, city attorney, and/or administrative staff concerning any city law enforcement matter including (but not limited to) parking tickets, traffic tickets, ordinance tickets, or municipal civil infraction citations.

The developer and architect must submit a conceptual statement expressing why the architecture should be considered art, including an explanation of the ideas, meaning, cultural significance or conceptual complexity expressed in the architecture. The second presentation shall be made at the completion of the city approval process. The developer must then submit a maquette and other materials which satisfactorily illustrate the to-be-built development. 
(2)  If a development application was received prior to the adoption of this section, the above requirements for the timing of a developer's presentations to the arts commission shall not apply, provided the first presentation is made at the planning commission meeting at which the project's approval is considered. 
(3)  The developer and architect shall demonstrate that there will be high quality materials and craftsmanship used in the execution of the construction. 
(4)  The architectural work, in the judgment of the arts commission shall be of extremely high artistic merit and would make a substantial cultural contribution to the city.

SECTION 105. APPROVAL 
105.1 Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of chapters 3 through 9 of this code, the code official shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the code official shall first find that a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this code impractical and the modification is in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not lessen life and safety requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the department files. 
105.2 Alternative materials, methods and equipment. The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code, provided that any such alternative has been approved. An alternative material or method of construction shall be approved where the code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. 
105.3 Required testing. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the code official shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense to the jurisdiction.

(1)  Habitable and occupiable residential rooms and spaces in existence on November 19, 1991, may have their existing use or occupancy continued if such use or occupancy was legal at that time, provided such continued use or occupancy is not dangerous to health or safety, and complies with the provisions and intent of the state construction code and provided that subsequently adopted code provisions, administrative regulations and policies specifically applicable to life safety and basic health safety requirements for existing structures and facilities shall be fully satisfied. The issuance of a class IV or VI initial rental unit license shall be deemed a change in the character of occupancy or use. 
(2)  The responsibility for establishing a prior legal nonconforming status (i.e., use, occupancy or room/space designation) shall rest with the property owner and shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence of building permits, affidavits, deposition from prior owners and neighboring property owners, or any other clear and convincing evidence acceptable to the chief code official. 
SECTION 106.0. CORRECTIVE ORDERS AND COMPLAINTS 
106.1 Corrective orders. Violations of chapter 1 and chapter 10, and use of non-habitable or occupiable space as prohibited by chapter 4, shall be charged without prior issuance of a corrective order. For all other violations, corrective orders shall be issued by the code official. Violations of chapters 3 through 9 of the property maintenance regulations which would result in an identical corrective order, as described in sections 106.2(5) and 106.2(6), being issued during any six-month period, may be charged without issuance of a second corrective order. It shall be a defense to a violation charged without issuance of a second corrective order pursuant to this section, that none of the tenants that resided at the premises during the time when the initial corrective order was issued, resided on the premises at the time of the violation. 
106.2 Form. Every corrective order shall: 
(1)  Be in writing; 
(2)  Include the address or a description of the real estate sufficient for identification; 
(3)  Identify the date upon which the inspection took place; 
(4)  Identify the name of the code official making the inspection; 
(5)  Contain a brief and concise description of the conditions found to render the property in violation and indicating the chapter and section of the City Code governing the violation; 
(6)  Contain a brief and concise description of the corrective actions required to comply with this chapter and/or other appropriate provisions of the City Code. The order shall indicate: 
(a)  A time for the corrective action(s) required to achieve compliance with a date certain set for reinspection to determine compliance; 
(b)  That all required permits must be obtained and work must be completed within the time period stated in the order. 
(c)  The right of the person(s) upon whom the violation notice is served to seek modification or withdrawal of the notice by written petition to an appeals board or appropriate review board unless it is an emergency order; and 
(d)  Unless it is an emergency order, the right of the person(s) upon whom the corrective order is served to seek a time extension which may be granted by the chief code official taking into account weather and other relevant circumstances. 
(7)  State that noncompliance with the order shall result in the issuance of one or more complaints/citations pursuant to section 107.1. 
106.3 Service of order. 
(1)  Every corrective order and any amended or supplemental notice shall be delivered to the owner or owner's legal agent by personal delivery or ordinary mail to the address of the property or in case of a licensed rental unit, to the last known address on file with the department for the owner or owner's legal agent. Alternatively, with prior written authorization from the responsible party, service may be made by electronic transmission to an e-mail or fax address provided by the responsible party. 
(2)  Failure to receive notice. If service has been accomplished pursuant to the above paragraphs of this section, or it is established that the person had actual or constructive knowledge of the condition resulting in violation of this chapter, claims of non-receipt of any required notice shall not affect the validity of any civil or criminal proceedings taken under this chapter. 
106.4 Notice to occupants. Except for Class V rental units, the code official shall provide a copy of any corrective order affecting a property to the occupants of that property by mailing one copy by ordinary mail addressed to the "Occupants" at the property address. 
106.5. Failure to serve occupants or tenants. The failure of the code official to serve any occupant or tenant with a notice and corrective order shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility to comply with the notice and corrective order. 
106.6 Extension of time for making repairs. 
(1)  The chief code official may, upon written application from the person required to conform to any corrective order or order to vacate and upon agreement by such person that he/she will comply with the order if allowed additional time, if upon determination that such a time extension will not create or perpetuate a situation imminently dangerous to life or limb, basic health safety and the general public welfare, grant an initial time extension within which compliance and reinspection shall be completed. The chief code official may grant an additional time extension when compliance cannot be achieved within the initial time extension due to weather or an extraordinary situation. The application shall be in such form as prescribed by the chief code official and shall be submitted at least five working days in advance of the original compliance date. No time extension shall be granted for any emergency notice violation and order. The authority of the chief code official to grant time extensions shall be limited to the physical repair or correction of the structure or premises and shall not in any way affect or extend the time to appeal a violation notice and corrective order to the building board of appeals. 
(2)  The chief code official shall only grant a time extension when the owner or owner's legal agent can substantiate in writing that compliance cannot be achieved by the initial compliance date or initial time extension compliance date due to one or more of the following conditions: 
(a)  Serious disability, illness or death directly affecting the owner or the owner's immediate family. 
(b)  Extraordinary economic hardship directly affecting the owner or the owner's immediate family. 
(c)  Weather conditions making it impossible or impractical to comply with established compliance dates. 
(d)  Litigation between an owner and a contractor responsible for compliance work making it impossible or impractical to comply with established compliance dates. 
(e)  Delays in obtaining supplies, materials or services beyond the owner's control that can be documented to the chief code official's satisfaction. 
(3)  Persons denied a time extension of a non-emergency corrective order by the chief code official may appeal that denial to the Housing Commission by filing a written request with the department within 7 calendar days of the notice of the denial. Receipt of an appeal shall stay enforcement of the corrective order pending the decision of the Housing Commission. The Housing Commission shall only grant a time extension if the applicant meets one of the conditions of paragraph (2) of this section.

107.1 Enforcement of corrective orders. 
(1)  Reinspection; failure to correct violations. At the end of the period of time allowed for the correction of any violations by any corrective order or extension, the code official shall order reinspection of the property described in the corrective order if no person has petitioned for a hearing before the board of appeals in accordance with this chapter pursuant to section 111.1. If upon reinspection the violations have not been corrected, the code official or designee shall issue or cause an appropriate complaint to be issued for the underlying violation. The chief code official may also: 
(a)  Recommend the issuance of a termination, suspension or revocation order for any rental unit license issued in accordance with this chapter. 
(b)  Take such action as may be necessary to correct or abate the condition constituting the violation, pursuant to any or all remedies provided by law.

107.3 Transfer of ownership or rental agreement. It shall be unlawful for the owner or owner's legal agent who has received a corrective order or upon whom an order has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease, or otherwise dispose of or transfer the property or lease held under a rental agreement to another person until the provisions of the corrective order have been complied with or until such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any violation notice and corrective order issued by the code official and furnish to the code official a signed statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such notice and order and establishing the unconditional responsibility of one of the parties for making the repairs or corrections required by any corrective order. 
107.4 False licensing representations. No owner, owner's agent, broker, or sales representative shall make any false or misleading representation regarding a prospective purchaser's ability to obtain a rental housing license or the occupancy limit of a prospective rental unit. 
107.5 Disclosure of licensing requirements upon sale. No owner, owner's agent, broker, or sales representative shall fail to inform any prospective purchaser of a dwelling of the laws of this city requiring a rental housing license and limitations on occupancy and illegal use of space.

107.6 Access by owner, owner's agent or operator. No person shall obstruct, interfere with or impede the owner, owner's legal agent, operator or employee access to any part of such structure and premises at reasonable times for the purpose of engaging in inspection, maintenance, repairs or alterations necessary to comply with provisions of this chapter. 
107.7 Penalty. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in a particular section, any person who violates any provision of chapter 1 or 10 of this code shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not less than $100.00 or not more than $500.00, imprisonment for a term not more than 90 days or both.

Each day that a violation is permitted to continue shall be deemed a separate offense. 
107.8 Actions for damages. The following shall apply for actions for damages that are initiated by a tenant or occupant of a property subject to the provisions of section 135 (MCL 125.535) or section 136 (MCL 125.536) of Public Act No. 167 of 1917 (MCL 125.41 et seq.), referenced as the Housing Law of Michigan.

The tenant or occupant shall also have injunctive or other relief appropriate to the abatement of the condition, and may request technical assistance from the code official relative to the documentation of code violations. 
(2)  Remedies under this section shall be in addition to such other relief as may be obtained by seeking enforcement of the section authorizing suits by the chief code official. The remedies shall be concurrent. When several remedies are available hereunder, the court may order any relief not inconsistent with the objectives of this chapter, and calculated to achieve compliance with it. 
107.9 Court orders. Whenever the chief code official determines that voluntary compliance with inspections, reinspections, notices, and orders under this chapter cannot be achieved, the chief code official may request the city attorney to seek and obtain an appropriate court order, to ensure the compliance with inspections, reinspections, notices and orders.

108.2.8 If a building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, including the adjoining grounds, because of dilapidation, decay, damage, or faulty construction or arrangement or otherwise, is unsanitary or unfit for human habitation or is in a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease, or is likely to cause injury to the health, safety, or general welfare of those living within.

108.3 Notice; contents; filing of notice with officer; service. 
108.3.1 When the chief code official determines that any building or portion thereof is in a dangerous or unsafe condition, as defined in subsection 108.2, the chief code official shall issue a notice of such condition. 
108.3.2 Such notice shall be directed to each owner of or party in interest in the building in whose name the property appears on the last city tax assessment records, and to any other person known to the chief code official to have an ownership interest. 
108.3.3 The notice shall set forth the particular conditions alleged to comprise the danger, and shall specify the time and place of a hearing on the condition of the building or structure at which time and place the person to whom the notice is directed shall have the opportunity to show cause why the building or structure shall not be ordered to be demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly maintained. 
108.3.4 The hearing officer shall be appointed by the mayor, to serve at the mayor's pleasure. The hearing officer shall be a person who has expertise in housing matters including, but not limited to, an engineer, architect, building contractor, building inspector, or member of a community housing organization and shall not be an employee of the city in any capacity. The building board of appeals may be appointed as the hearing officer. If the board of appeals is appointed, decisions shall be made by a majority of a quorum present in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. The building official shall file a copy of the notice of the dangerous and unsafe condition with the hearing officer. 
108.3.5 All notices shall be in writing and shall be served upon the person to whom they are directed personally or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or party in interest at the address shown on the tax records, at least ten days before the date of the hearing described in the notice. If any person to whom a notice is directed is not personally served, in addition to mailing the notice, a copy thereof shall be posted upon a conspicuous part of the building or structure. 
108.4 Hearing; testimony; decision; order, nonappearance or noncompliance; review; order to show cause; costs. 
108.4.1 The hearing officer shall take testimony of the building official, the owner of the property, and any interested party. The hearing officer shall render a decision either closing the proceedings or ordering the building to be demolished or otherwise made safe, or properly maintained. 
108.4.2 If it is determined by the hearing officer that the building or structure should be demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly maintained, the hearing officer shall so order, fixing a time in the order for the owner, agent or lessee to comply with the order. 
108.4.3 If it is determined that a structure is unsafe and the hearing officer has determined that the cost of the repairs would exceed 100 percent of the true cash value of the structure as reflected on the city assessment tax rolls in effect prior to the building becoming an unsafe structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the purpose of this article that such structure is a public nuisance which may be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. This section is not meant to apply to those situations where a structure is unsafe as a result of an event beyond the control of the owner, such as fire, windstorm, tornado, flood or other Act of God. If a structure has become unsafe because of an event beyond the control of the owner, the owner shall be given by the city manager, or his/her designee, reasonable time within which to make repairs and the structure shall not be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. If the owner does not make the repairs within the designated time period, then the structure may be ordered demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. 
108.4.4 If the owner, agent or lessee fails to appear or neglects or refuses to comply with the order, the hearing officer shall file a report of the findings and a copy of the order with the city council not more than five days after noncompliance by the owner and request that the necessary action be taken to enforce the order. A copy of the findings and order of the hearing officer shall be served on the owner, agent or lessee in the manner prescribed in subsection 108.3.5 above. 
108.4.5 The city council shall fix a date not less than 30 days after the hearing prescribed in section 108.4.1 for a hearing on the findings and order of the hearing officer and shall give notice to the owner, agent or lessee in the manner prescribed in subsection 108.3.5 of the time and place of the hearing. At the hearing the owner, agent or lessee shall be given the opportunity to show cause why the order should not be enforced, and the city council shall either approve, disapprove, or modify the order. If the city council approves or modifies the order, the city council shall take all necessary action to enforce the order. If the order is approved or modified, the owner, agent, or lessee shall comply with the order within 60 days after the date of the hearing under this subsection. In case of an order of demolition, if the city council determines that the building or structure has been substantially destroyed by fire, wind, flood or other natural disaster, and the cost of repair of the building or structure will be greater than the state equalized value of the building or structure, the owner, agent or lessee shall comply with the order of demolition within 21 days after the date of the hearing under this subsection. 
108.4.6 If there is not full compliance with the order and the order has not been appealed to circuit court, or was appealed and affirmed, the city may take whatever steps it deems appropriate to bring the building into compliance including demolition, maintenance or seeking appropriate court orders. The cost of bringing the property into compliance, including the cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of the building or structure, or grounds adjoining the building or structure incurred by the city shall be reimbursed to the city by the owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears. 
108.4.7 The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon the last city tax assessment records shall be notified of the amount of such cost by first class mail at the address shown on the records. If the owner or party in interest fails to pay the same within 30 days after mailing by the assessor, the city shall have a lien for the cost incurred to bring the property into conformance with the order. The lien shall not take effect until notice of the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. The lien does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens. The lien shall be added to the next tax roll of the city, and the same shall be collected in the same manner in all respects as provided by law for the collection of taxes by the city. 
108.4.8 In addition to other remedies under this chapter, the city may bring an action against the owner of the building or structure for the full cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or structure. The city shall have a lien on the property for the amount of a judgment obtained pursuant to this subsection. The lien provided for in this subsection shall not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as provided by law.

Any or all parts of this file may be stored on electronic medium. 
SECTION 1001.0 RENTAL HOUSING 
1001.1 Rental requirements. No dwelling shall be leased or occupied for rental purposes by any person unless it is first in compliance with the provisions of every section of this article. Occupancy of any dwelling by any person other than the owner of record shall be presumed to require a rental license. 
(1)  This presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the occupant has ownership equity of 25 percent or more of the fee or life estate evidenced by: 
(a)  A recorded deed; or 
(b)  A recorded land contract; or 
(c)  An unrecorded land contract with supporting evidence that it was not entered into in order to circumvent the requirements of this article, including subsequent recordation. 
(2)  Occupants of any dwelling, claiming any form of ownership in accordance with a land contract, option to purchase, exchange contract, or any other legal instrument shall provide proof that the transfer of ownership is supported by a substantial equity interest in the property by the person or persons claiming ownership. 
1001.2 Exceptions. A rental unit license is not required under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Family occupancy. Any member of a family, as defined by chapter 50 of the City Code, including nieces and nephews, may occupy a dwelling as long as any other member of that family is the owner of that dwelling. 
(2)  House-sitting. During the temporary absence of the owner and owner's family of a domicile for a period not to exceed two years in any five-year period, the owner may permit up to two unrelated individuals or a family to occupy the premises without a rental license by notifying the department, on a form provided by the department, of the address of the owner's temporary domicile, the projected duration of the owner's absence, and the identity of the unrelated individual or family who will occupy the premises during the owner's absence. 
(a)  An owner who is in active military service may request up to an additional two-year extension of the two-year limitation of this subsection if all of the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The owner's active military service requires the owner to remain away from the home for an additional period of time; and 
(ii)  The owner plans on returning to the home when the service allows it; and 
(iii)  The owner files a signed affidavit with the department attesting to the above requirements; and 
(iv)  The owner does not have any delinquent fees or taxes owed to the city. 
(b)  The chief code official shall grant a properly filed request for an extension if: 
(i)  The home would not otherwise meet the bases for imposing rental license sanctions pursuant to section 1008.0 of this article if the property were a licensed rental; and 
(ii)  There is no other reason to suspect the truthfulness of the affidavit. 
(c)  If the chief code official denies the request, the chief code official shall state each reason for the denial in a written correspondence to the owner. The owner may appeal that decision to the housing commission by filing a written request with the department within 21 days of notice of the denial. The housing commission shall grant the extension if, after a hearing, the housing commission determines the chief code official's basis for the denial was unfounded. 
(3)  One- and two-family dwelling sales. The sale of any one- or two-family dwelling intended for occupancy by the owner or owners of record which are to be occupied by the seller under a rental agreement for a period of less than 90 days following closing. The sale of any one- or two-family dwelling intended for occupancy under a lease with option to purchase agreement, life estate agreement or any other form of conditional sale agreement, shall require a rental unit license if legal or equitable ownership is not transferred in its entirety within 90 days of execution of the conditional sales agreement. 
(4)  Exchange student, visiting clergy, medical caregiver, child care. For an owner-occupied dwelling, additional occupancy by exchange students placed through a recognized education exchange student program, one visiting clergy and their immediate family members, or clerical aide to a local church or congregation, or one person to provide child care or medically prescribed care. 
(5)  Estate representative. Occupancy by a personal representative, trustee, or guardian of the estate and their family where the dwelling was owner-occupied for the last year prior to the owner's death, and the occupancy does not exceed two years from the date of death of the owner by notifying the code enforcement department on a form provided by the department of the owner's name, date of death, and name of the person occupying the premises. 
(6)  Domestic servants. Occupancy by a domestic servant with the owner or owner's family if the domestic servant is employed full time as a domestic servant for the owner or owner's family and the owner or owner's family is paying social security taxes for the domestic servant's employment as a domestic servant. 
(7)  Religious occupancy. Occupancy of property owned by a religious organization for two unrelated or a family if occupied by clergy, religious leaders, religious officials, or other persons integrally involved in the religious organization and no rent is either being paid by the occupants or collected from the occupants by the religious organization solely for the occupancy. For purposes of this provision, religious organization means an organization that presents sufficient evidence to the court or code official that the organization has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be tax exempt pursuant to IRC § 501(c)(3) because it is operated exclusively for religious purposes or a religious or apostolic association or corporation determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be tax exempt pursuant to IRC § 501(d). 
SECTION 1002.0 RENTAL UNIT LICENSE CLASSIFICATIONS AND EXPIRATION 
1002.1 Rental license classifications. There are six classifications of rental licenses: 
(1)  Class I rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a one-family dwelling in which the owner resides to lease or rent room(s) to one person. 
(2)  Class II rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a one-family dwelling in which the owner resides to lease or rent room(s) to two or more persons. 
(3)  Class III rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a one-family dwelling in which the owner does not reside or a two-family dwelling to lease or rent the dwelling to a family or two unrelated persons per rental unit. 
(4)  Class IV rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a one-family dwelling in which the owner does not reside or a two-family dwelling to lease or rent the dwelling to a family or three or more unrelated persons per rental unit. 
(5)  Class V rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a class A multiple dwelling to rent or lease the dwelling units or rooming units contained therein. 
(6)  Class VI rental license: A license that authorizes the owner of a class B multiple dwelling to rent or lease the dwelling units or rooming units contained therein. 
1002.2 Class of rental unit license issued. The class of rental unit license issued to any owner shall be in accordance with the type of dwelling and the number of persons allowed to occupy the dwelling pursuant to the requirements of all the provisions of the City Code. 
1002.3 Rental unit license expiration by classification: 
(1)  A "class I" rental unit license shall expire 39 months from the effective date of the license unless one of the following occurs first: 
(a)  The license is revoked pursuant to this Code. 
(b)  The property is sold. 
(c)  There were conditions placed on the license and the conditions of the license were not met. 
(d)  The owner ceases to reside in the premises. 
(2)  A "class II" rental unit license shall expire 26 months from the effective date of the license unless one of the following occurs first: 
(a)  The license is revoked pursuant to this Code. 
(b)  The property is sold. 
(c)  There were conditions placed on the license and the conditions of the license were not met. 
(d)  The owner ceases to reside in the premises. 
(3)  A "class III, IV, V, and VI" rental unit license shall expire 13 months from the effective date of the license unless one of the following occurs first:

(b)  The property is sold. 
(c)  There were conditions placed on the license and the conditions of the license were not met. 
1002.4 Transfers of rental unit ownership. A rental license is issued to an owner of a rental unit and only permits the owner to lease the rental unit in conformance with the license. Upon transfer of ownership of a rental unit, any existing license to lease the rental unit expires. This includes transfers of ownership between corporations or other legal entities even where there is identical ownership interest in the acquiring legal entity as in the previous legal entity. 
1002.5 Effect of rental unit license expiration. For a license that expired as a result of the sale of the property or for failure to renew the license, application for reissuance of the license may be made immediately. For a license that expired for failure to comply with licensing conditions, application may be made only after the conditions have been met. Application for reissuance of an expired license must be made within one year of expiration of the license and shall be processed in the same manner as a renewal license application. Renewal or reissuance of a license within one year of expiration shall not be considered a change in use and shall preserve any prior legal non-conforming rental use or occupancy which the owner or prior owner has established. After a license has been expired for one year, any license application shall be processed as an initial license and any prior legal non-conforming rental use or occupancy which the owner or prior owner had established shall be deemed abandoned if the department presents sufficient evidence at the review hearing that the owner intended to abandon the non-conforming use.

Regardless of the applicability of 1004.2.1, the chief code official may order an all trades inspection when, considering the nature, number and severity of violations, the chief code official determines any of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  A violation constitutes an immediate hazard to the health, safety or welfare of the occupant; 
(2)  Sufficient violations exist which materially degrade the weather resistance, the structure or the plumbing, electrical, or mechanical equipment of the building; 
(3)  Appearance of the property creates a blighting condition for the area in which the building is located; 
(4)  There is a history of repeated or substantial numbers of code violations. 
1004.2.3 Notice. If the chief code official orders an all trades inspection, the chief code official shall send a notice to the owner and/or legal agent of the property by first class or electronic mail stating the basis upon which the all trades inspection was ordered and listing the types of inspectors that will perform the all trades inspection. 
1004.2.4 Review. The owner or legal agent of a property may request the city manager review a decision of the chief code official to require an "all trades" inspection. Such request shall be made within three days of the receipt of notice requiring an "all trades" inspection and shall be submitted in writing to the office of the city manager and the city council. The city manager shall, within 15 working days of receiving the request, review the decision of the chief code official and shall, by ordinary mail, communicate a decision to sustain, modify, or overturn the decision of the chief code official to the petitioner and to the city council. The petitioner may request a stay on conducting the "all trades" inspection during the city manager's review of the decision. 
1004.3 Additional inspections. In addition to the initial or renewal inspections, inspections may be scheduled on one or more of the following bases: 
(1)  By area, such that all rental units in a predetermined geographical area will be inspected simultaneously, or within a short period of time. 
(2)  By written complaint, such that written complaints of violations will be inspected within a reasonable time. 
(3)  By recurrent violations, such that any rental unit or the owner of any rental unit which has been found to have a high incidence of recurrent or uncorrected violations will be inspected more frequently. 
(4)  Whenever reasonable cause exists to believe that there is a violation of this chapter on any premises or other conditions which make the structure or premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous. 
(5)  For the purpose of auditing inspections. 
(6)  For the purpose of reinspection to ensure the correction of any violations in existence at a previous inspection. 
1004.4 Inspections of class V licensed dwellings. A minimum of 20 percent of the units contained in those properties with a class V license shall be inspected prior to renewal with a minimum of four units inspected per structure. The units to be inspected shall be randomly selected. The number of units inspected may be increased at the discretion of the department should significant code violations be found or should the inspector have reasonable cause to believe other violations exist in the uninspected units. 
1004.5 Inspection notification and presence of owner at inspection. Owners shall be notified of inspections in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Initial or renewal inspections. The owner, the owner's legal agent, or a designated owner's representative, if any, shall be notified of and is entitled to be present at all initial and renewal inspections. If the owner desires a representative other than a legal agent to be present, the owner shall notify the department of planning, building and development. 
(2)  Prior to conducting an inspection for an initial rental unit license application or renewal, the code enforcement department shall give the owner or, if designated, the owner's legal agent, reasonable notice by first class mail sent to the address on file. The notice shall contain the date and time of the inspection. 
(3)  Investigative inspections. For any inspection authorized by this article other than an initial or renewal inspection, the department shall attempt to give the owner or owner's legal agent reasonable notification of the date and time of the inspection unless the chief code official has probable cause to believe the lack of notice is necessary for the appropriate conduct of an investigation. 
1004.6 Inspection authorization. An application for a rental unit license shall authorize the entry upon and inspection of the premises at all reasonable times as required by this chapter to the extent permitted by law. The failure of an owner to permit an inspection of the rental unit after notice is given shall constitute a withdrawal of the rental unit license application and a reason for denial of an application. 
1004.7 Inspection reports. Within 30 days after an initial or renewal inspection has been conducted, the department shall notify the owner or the owner's legal agent of the results of the inspection. The notice shall be personally served or sent to the address on file, by first class or electronic mail and shall include a description of any deficiencies required to be corrected, the nature and extent of any violations of city ordinances found, and in the case of violations of chapter 3 through 9 of this code, a reasonable time limit within which the violations must be corrected. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the tenants. 
1004.8 Private inspections. In the performance of the requirements of this chapter, the city manager may contract for inspection services. All inspection and test methods shall conform to generally accepted standards by qualified inspectors. If there are no generally recognized and accepted inspection and test methods, the city code official shall determine inspection and test procedures. All inspections and tests shall be made by licensed "trade" inspectors or by an agency approved by the city manager. The department may require the submission of detailed drawings and surveys properly sealed by registered architects and engineers.

(b)  During the first year of licensure, the owner or legal agent shall not lease the property for occupancy prior to compliance with any conditions imposed by city council which require compliance prior to occupancy. No right to continue licensure, beyond the first year, accrues or vests in the owner, the owner's agent, or the property itself; 
(c)  The property shall have reinspections as established by city council upon recommendation of the housing commission, with inspections more frequent than annually if the housing commission recommends and city council determines there is a need for more frequent inspections based upon the information provided at the hearing; 
(d)  One hundred twenty days prior to the conclusion of the first year of licensure, the owner shall apply for a regular rental unit license upon receipt of which, the chief code official shall notify all residents within 300 feet of the property of the receipt of the application and request the residents to notify the chief code official if they have evidence that the property has deteriorated or otherwise not met the licensing conditions; 
(e)  Upon expiration of the conditional license, the licensee shall demonstrate that the property has not deteriorated and has remained in compliance with all code provisions in chapter 1 and 10 of this code and that any violations of chapter 3-9 were corrected within the time allotted in the corrective order;

(2)  The commission may also recommend that city council: 
(a)  Place a condition on the license requiring that corrective work be completed within a specified period of time if such corrective work, in the opinion of the code official, does not affect the health or safety of any tenant. Such a condition shall provide: 
(i)  The time for the completion of the corrective work to be done, but no longer than 180 days from the date of issuance of the approval of the license or the change of classification unless extended pursuant to section 1005.6 (extensions to comply with license conditions); 
(ii)  Completion of corrective work within the required time period set forth in the condition shall preclude the license from expiring by operation of law provided that the code official has issued a certificate of completion to the licensee; 
(iii)  Failure to have the corrective work completed within the permitted time shall cause the license to expire by operation of law. 
(b)  Recommend that city council impose additional conditions necessary to ensure compliance with the performance standards of section 1005.3(7) (review standards for properties that have not gone through a plan of development). These conditions may include:

1005.4a City council action on application for initial license or change in classification. The city council may, by majority vote of the council members present and voting, accept or reject, in whole or in part, the recommendation of the housing commission and either authorize or deny the issuance of a conditional license. The council, if authorizing issuance of a conditional license, may impose conditions on the license in accordance with 1005.4 in addition to or in lieu of any recommended by the housing commission. The council shall state the reasons for its decision on the record. The decision shall be reduced to writing by the city clerk and forwarded to the applicant within 14 days of the hearing.

(2)  Notice. At least ten working days prior to the hearing, the secretary of the housing commission shall have notices of the date, time, and place of the hearing sent to: 
(a)  The owner and legal agent, along with copies of all documents provided to the commission;

(4)  Commission findings. After hearing all evidence, the housing commission shall make a determination as to whether or not sufficient evidence has been presented to impose sanctions and, if so, the specific basis for the imposition of sanctions. The failure of the chief code official to refer a rental unit license to the housing commission for license sanctions shall not be a basis for the commission to fail to find a sufficient basis to impose license sanctions on a later referral. Neither a complaint and warrant which is dismissed or ruled invalid, nor an appearance ticket or complaint for which a copy was not provided to the owner or the owner's legal agent within ten days of its issuance shall be considered for the imposition of sanctions. 
(5)  Part 2--Commission sanction hearing. If the commission determines there is a basis for the imposition of sanctions, it shall review:

(b)  Any public comment; 
(c)  Any comment presented by the owner, the owner's legal agent, and/or owner's representative; 
(d)  Any corrective action taken by the owner or owner's legal agent prior to referral; 
(e)  Any corrective action taken by the owner or owner's legal agent subsequent to referral and prior to the hearing; 
(f)  The degree of cooperation exhibited by the owner/legal agent in attempting to resolve the problems leading to the referral. A presumption of cooperation shall be made where the basis for sanctions is tenant behavior and the owner has, prior to referral:

(a)  Impose specific terms and conditions onto the rental unit license designed to correct the specific problems that brought the license to the commission for sanctions including, but not limited to, at the direction of the commission, any or all of the following: 
(i)  A requirement for an increased frequency of inspections; 
(ii)  A requirement that the owner or legal agent and, when appropriate, the tenants file a property management plan;

1008.7 Emergency rental license suspension.

The city manager is empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate all or part of the structure and premises in accordance with the provisions of section 104.9 Emergency Orders. Upon the issuance of a rental unit license suspension order, the department shall forward a copy of the order to the commission, and the commission shall schedule a review hearing to be held no later than 15 days from the date of the order, after which the commission shall affirm, modify, or dissolve the order. 
1008.8 Notice to occupants. The department shall serve, by first class mail, proper notice to every tenant of a rental unit of any license sanction and by posting the notice on the main entrance to the rental unit. 
1008.9 Reinstatement of suspended license. A suspended license shall be automatically reinstated upon completion of the suspension period unless the license expires during the term of suspension.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-31. - Legislative findings of fact. 
    It has been found that there are specific flood hazard areas within the City of East Lansing which are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public and private expenditure for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare; that these flood losses are caused and increased by the cumulative effect of development in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, damage uses in other areas when inadequately anchored and themselves suffer inordinate loss when inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage; and that the general welfare of the residents and safety of all structures located within or adjacent to flood hazard areas would substantially benefit by the implementation of certain limitations upon development as herein set forth. 
(Code 1994, ch. 103, § 8.401) 
Sec. 18-32. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health. 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard. 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas. 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard. 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, often referred to as a 100-year flood. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    Director means the director of planning, building and development or his or her designee. 
    Flood or flooding means: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; 
c.  Mudflows; and 
(2)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding, as defined in subsection (1)a. of this definition. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the FEMA, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A99, V, VE.

    Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not a part of the main structure.

a.  Before the improvement or repair is started. 
b.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
(2)  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Watercourse means any natural or artificial stream, ditch, river, creek, channel, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, or ravine in which water flows in a definite direction or course, either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite bed, channel, or banks.

(Code 1994, ch. 103, § 8.413; Ord. No. 1316, 11-6-2013) 
Sec. 18-43. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (1) through (11) in section 18-42(c) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. A variance may be issued to permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in section 18-42(c), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Sec. 18-63. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided, or any areas within zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A99, V and VE on the city's FIRM, the following standards are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to not less than one foot above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lower floor, including basement, elevated to not less than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy, and floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 18-40. 
(3)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-34 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following additional provisions apply: prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(4)  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section shall be elevated so that either (i) the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or (ii) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(a)  Time limit for action by commission. Within 60 days after the receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic district commission shall review and approve or deny the applications. The failure of the commission to act within 60 calendar days after the date a complete application is filed with the commission shall be considered to constitute approval unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the commission, or the applicant withdraws the application in writing.

(d)  Interior features. The commission shall review and act upon only the exterior features of a resource and shall not review and act upon interior arrangements unless authorized by city council or unless interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource. 
(e)  Special considerations. 
(1)  New resources. New resources in historic districts shall be compatible with the surrounding resources and shall not intrude upon the overall historic character of the streetscape and the historic district. Contemporary architectural styles, materials and methods of construction may be introduced into the district through new resources when they serve to develop the district as a vital, attractive neighborhood and are sensitive to the historic context. The historic district commission shall evaluate new resources for conformance with the Secretary of the Interior's standards. The historic district commission's review of new resources shall also evaluate the compatibility of the proposal in the areas of height, scale, massing, directional expression, setback, platforms, sense of entry, shapes, rhythm of openings and historic imitations. 
(2)  Landmark resources. Landmark resources shall meet the highest restoration standards possible given the unique circumstances of each application. 
(3)  Americans with Disabilities Act. All work shall comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Michigan Barrier Free Law, where applicable. The commission may support variances, when necessary, to protect a resource. 
(4)  Moving a resource. In reviewing a proposed moving of a historic resource, the commission shall take the following into consideration: 
a.  The first priority is to move the resource to a site in a historic district that is compatible with the style, size, and age of the resource. 
b.  As much of the original resource should be retained as possible. All parts should be labeled before dismantling. 
c.  The existing or original orientation of the resource should be maintained. 
d.  The original elevations on the resource should be maintained. 
(Ord. No. 934, ch. 104, § 8.513, 5-2-2000) 
Sec. 20-64. - Time limitation of approval.

    An application for a certificate of appropriateness for work, determined by the commission to be in noncompliance with the preservation guidelines, may be allowed upon issuance of a notice to proceed. The commission shall issue a notice to proceed instead of a certificate of appropriateness if any of the following conditions are found to prevail and the commission finds that, upon the recommendation of the building department and the historic preservation officer, the proposed work is necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(1)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the structure's occupants and the building official considers emergency maintenance is necessary. 
(2)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances. 
(3)  The proposed alterations or additions constitute the only available or feasible alternative to provide barrier-free accessibility. 
(4)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner as evidenced by the submission of the following: 
a.  An estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the commission for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; 
b.  A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation; 
c.

d.  In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property; 
e.  The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer; 
f.  If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years; and depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period; 
g.  The remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years; 
h.  All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing, or ownership of the property; 
i.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any, within the previous two years; 
j.  The assessed value of the property according to the two most recent assessments; 
k.  The real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
l.  The form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for-profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, or other; 
m.  Any other information the owner chooses to provide. 
(5)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community as evidenced by the result of a referendum on the retention of the resource.

(b)  After voting to deny an application, the commission shall transmit notice of denial to the applicant by first class mail.

The appeal shall be filed within 60 days after the decision to deny is furnished to the applicant. 
(d)  If an application is for work that will adversely affect the exterior of a resource the commission considers valuable to the city, and the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, the commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
(e)  Any citizen or duly organized local historic preservation organization, as well as resource owners, jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the historic district commission may appeal the decision to the circuit court, except that a permit applicant aggrieved by a decision rendered by the commission may not appeal to the court without first exhausting the right to appeal to the state historic preservation review board.

ARTICLE IV. - PRESERVATION GUIDELINES 

Sec. 20-101. - Established; applicability. 
(a)  The commission shall establish preservation guidelines in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The preservation guidelines shall govern the historic preservation officer and commission's decisions with regard to certificates of appropriateness. 
(b)  The preservation guidelines shall include the following: 
(1)  The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings as set forth in 36 CFR 67. 
(2)  Protected architectural features include, but are not limited to, a building's general shape; gables, dormers and other roof features; cornices, brackets and eaves; size, shape, arrangement, number and size of window panes and muntins; beveled, leaded and stained glass; door and window trim; ornamental moldings; distinctive siding, such as stone, stucco, brick or patterned shingling; distinctive roofing, such as false thatch, slate and Spanish tile. 
(3)  Demolition of any resource within a historic district shall be prohibited unless the historic district commission finds said demolition to meet the criteria outlined in section 20-66. 
(4)  The general shape of a building or structure's roof, including original dormers, gables and cornice lines and chimneys, shall not be changed. 
(5)  New chimneys or soil stacks which extend more than one foot above the surface of the roof may be permitted provided they do not occupy more than one square foot in horizontal area or are invisible from the street. 
(6)  Substitute siding may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the commission, and may be permitted provided the existing siding is so deteriorated or damaged that it cannot be repaired; the size and style of the new siding is substantially similar to the original protected architectural features, including but not limited to window trim, patterned shingling, stucco, stone or brick and decorative brackets and cornices are not covered, removed or damaged; and the substitute siding is placed over the original siding to allow for restoration in the future. 
(7)  Existing unpainted brick or stone exterior walls shall not be painted. 
(8)  Exposed wood surfaces on new work such as porches, railings and fences shall be painted or stained to coordinate with the existing building. 
(9)  Paint or siding color selection shall not be regulated. The commission may, however, make non-binding recommendations for the use of historically accurate color schemes. 
(10)  The shape, size, number, arrangement and function of replacement windows and doors shall preserve the basic design and size of the originals. Replacement windows shall be substantially similar to the old windows and within ten percent of the original dimensions. Muntins on new windows must appear to be of the same width as the original muntins. Alternate materials may be used for replacement, provided the new materials replicate the original in appearance. 
(11)  Fences may be permitted with approval of an application. Metal chainlink fences shall be prohibited in front yards. In the case of schools, child care facilities and other uses where human safety concerns are paramount, the commission may approve any type of fencing necessary to effectively address the safety concerns of that use. 
(12)  Driveways and other surface paving shall meet the standards contained in section 38-64(a), and chapter 50, article VIII, pertaining to off-street parking requirements, of the City Code. 
(13)  General maintenance and parts replacement for Westinghouse and King standard streetlights shall not require a certificate of appropriateness, providing that no stylistic changes are made in the standards or globes. Should appropriate replacement parts become unavailable, the proposed alternatives may be approved by the historic district commission. 
(14)  Removal of street trees shall be allowed where such trees are dead, damaged, diseased or constitute a threat to safety. No certificate of appropriateness for the removal of a street tree is necessary, provided that the department of public works and environmental services or other designated city staff verifies, in writing, that the reason for removal fulfills one of the above criteria. Removed trees shall be replaced within one year of removal with an appropriate substitute. Tree replacements shall take into account the contribution of specific species to the district history and character, and the susceptibility of certain species to disease. 
(15)  Landmark property owners may be required to consult with the design assistance team prior to undertaking any work which could potentially affect eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. 
(16)  In reviewing an application in a commercial historic district, the commission shall promote the adaptive use of residential structures within the district while maintaining the overall historic character of the structures, the streetscape and the historic district. The commission may provide for additional flexibility in the application of the preservation guidelines, including, but not limited to, changes to window and door openings, entrance changes, and additions and changes to accommodate barrier free accessibility. 
(17)  New construction in a historic district shall be compatible with the surrounding structures; and shall not intrude upon the overall historic character of the streetscape and the historic district; contemporary architectural styles, materials and methods of construction may be introduced into the district through new structures when they serve to develop the district as a vital, attractive neighborhood and are sensitive to the historic context. The historic district commission's review of new structures shall evaluate the compatibility of the proposal in the areas of height, scale, massing, directional expression, setback, platforms, sense of entry, shapes, rhythm of openings and historic imitations. 
(18)  Where an applicant can document that the original design, materials or method of construction of a resource makes adherence to the preservation guidelines infeasible, impractical or substantially more expensive than a proposed alternative, the historic district commission shall permit the use of a mutually acceptable alternative, provided that the alternate substantially complies with the spirit and intent of this chapter. 
(19)  In reviewing an application for an adaptive use, the commission shall provide additional flexibility in the application of the preservation guidelines, including, but not limited to, changes to window and door openings, entrance changes, additions and changes to accommodate barrier-free accessibility.

In its resolution, the council may, at its discretion, continue the emergency moratorium, if any, for certain types of work which include, but are not limited to, applications for all pending work within the proposed historic district with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic district were an established historic district. The moratorium may continue in the proposed historic district for not more than one year, or until such time as city council approves or rejects the establishment of the historic district, whichever occurs first.

ARTICLE III. - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS 

Sec. 22-51. - Purpose. 
    Many persons today share a life as families in enduring and committed relationships apart from marriages. Some are lesbians, some are gay males, some are bisexual persons, and some are heterosexual persons. The City of East Lansing has an interest in strengthening and supporting all caring, committed and responsible family forms. The city has also long recognized the importance of cultural diversity and equal treatment and, toward that end, has adopted a human rights ordinance which protects its citizens from discrimination based on, among other things, marital status and sexual orientation. 
    This domestic partnership ordinance furthers the City of East Lansing's interest in families and in cultural diversity and equal treatment by establishing a mechanism for the public expression, sanction and documentation of the commitment reflected by the domestic partnership, whose members cannot legally marry or choose not to marry. It provides appropriate public recognition of these relationships. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 22-52. - Definition of domestic partnership. 
    For purposes of this chapter, "domestic partners" are two persons: 
(1)  Who declare that they are in a relationship of mutual support, caring and commitment; and 
(2)  Who share the common necessities of life; and 
(3)  Who are not related by blood in a manner that would bar marriage in the State of Michigan; and 
(4)  Neither of whom are married or in any other domestic partnership; and 
(5)  Who are at least 18 years of age and otherwise competent to enter into a contract. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013)

(1)  Presenting the completed form to the city clerk who will file it and give the partners a certificate of domestic partnership showing that the declaration was filed; or 
(2)  Having both partners retain a copy of the completed uniform declaration of domestic partnership form. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 22-54. - Ending domestic partnerships.

(3)  One of the partners legally marries. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 22-55. - Notice of end of domestic partnership. 
    Notice of the end of a domestic partnership shall be accomplished as follows: 
(1)  To a domestic partner. A domestic partnership is terminated pursuant to section 22-54 when at least one of the partners signs (with notarization) a notice saying that the partnership has ended. If the declaration of domestic partnership was filed with the city clerk, the notice must be filed with the clerk to be valid. If one partner does not sign the notice, the clerk shall mail a copy of the notice to the last known address of that domestic partner. If the declaration of domestic partnership was not filed with the city clerk, then the notice of the end of the partnership must either be signed by both partners or be signed by one partner, notarized and mailed to the last known address of the other domestic partner. 
(2)  To third parties. When a domestic partnership ends, a former partner may cancel a declaration given to a third party by giving the third party a signed notice stating that the partnership has ended. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 22-56. - Form of declarations. 
    The city clerk shall provide a uniform declaration of domestic partnership form, which shall be accompanied by a copy of this ordinance and information about available counseling for AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in the same manner as required for marriage licenses. 
(Ord. No. 1305, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 22-57. - Fees. 
    The city clerk shall charge a fee for the filing of a domestic partnership declaration in accordance with the amount set forth in the city's budget resolution, which fee shall be designed to pay the actual costs to the city clerk's office for processing domestic partnership declarations and termination notices, but in no case shall the fee for a domestic partnership declaration exceed the fee charged for a marriage license in the county. The payment of the established fee shall entitle the person filing a declaration on behalf of the domestic partnership to receive from the clerk two copies of a certificate of domestic partnership. Additional certified copies of the certificate shall be available at the same time or at any other time for a fee set forth in the city's budget resolution to the person filing or named in the domestic partnership.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 34-1. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council hereby finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development for non-agricultural uses, such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational uses, and roads. This erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed-out fills, roads, and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and road ditches, muddies streams, silts-in lakes and reservoirs, and is considered a major water pollutant. 
(Code 1994, ch. 102, § 8.301) 
Sec. 34-2. - Purpose.

ARTICLE IV. - REMY-CHANDLER DRAINAGE DISTRICT 

Sec. 34-101. - Restrictions. 
    No building or grading permit shall be issued for premises within the Remy-Chandler Drainage District, unless the city engineer makes a determination, based on the plans and contour map required by this section, or in the event no contour map is required, from other information or plans as shall be required by the city engineer, that no increase in the rate of stormwater runoff into the Remy-Chandler Drainage Basin will be caused by the construction. In making such determination, the city engineer shall be guided by the following principles and procedures. 
(1)  Exemptions. The following type of construction shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
a.  Platted subdivisions or non-subdivided sites if less than one acre and less than 50 percent of the site is covered by impervious material. 
b.  Alteration, repairs, or remodeling of existing buildings if the site will remain less than 50 percent covered by impervious material. 
c.  Construction of small accessory buildings or uses, if the site will remain less than 50 percent covered by impervious material. 
d.  Construction of single- or two-family dwellings where less than 50 percent of the site is to be covered with buildings or other impervious material, provided however, that this exception shall not be available to owners of unplatted lots where there have previously been obtained four or more building permits for other single-family or two-family dwellings within the common legal description within the past ten years. 
(2)  Presumptions. The following types of construction shall be presumed by the city engineer not to result in an increase in the rate of stormwater runoff into the Remy-Chandler Drainage Basin, absent a clear preponderance of the evidence to the contrary: construction which the city engineer determines will provide adequate on-site drainage retention facilities meeting the following criteria. An applicant shall provide, with his/her plans, a certificate by a professional engineer, architect, or landscape architect, certifying the facilities as meeting all of the following criteria. 
a.  The stormwater retention facilities shall be designed to hold a ten-year storm. All project submissions shall include data and drawings showing the ponding location of storm drainage from a ten-year and 50-year storm. 
b.  No roadway, driveway, parking lot, or aisle in a residential area, nor any roadway or driveway in any other area shall be used to hold stormwater from a ten-year storm. (Such structures may be used for storms, exceeding a ten-year storm.) 
c.  No storm retention or ponding area shall include required pedestrian walkways, nor be located closer than 20 feet to any building. A 50-year storm profile shall be used to satisfy this requirement. 
d.  In any subdivision or development project where individual lots are created for sale or occupancy as single-family or two-family homes, where any portion of the lot is to be used for stormwater retention for a 50-year storm, the deeds applying to any such lots shall carry notice of this condition, and of the requirement that the retention area be maintained by its owner. 
e.  No building permit shall be issued where any portion of an adjacent lot or premises, owned by a person other than the applicant, is to be used for stormwater retention for a 50-year storm. 
f.  Storm drainage flow from the property during and after development shall be restricted to the rate of stormwater runoff from the property prior to any construction/development activity. 
g.  In any construction/development project where dwelling units are to be rented, the lease for those dwelling units located at or partially below grade level and within 50 feet of an area to be covered with stormwater from a 50-year storm shall contain notice of the temporary ponding situation. 
h.  No building permit shall be issued where the city engineer determines that the stormwater retention facility will create a health or safety hazard to the public. 
(3)  Variances. The building official shall have the power to issue a building permit, despite a determination that the construction will result in an increased rate of runoff into the Remy-Chandler Drainage District, when any one of the special findings are clearly demonstrated by the facts presented. 
a.  That there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships resulting to the owner caused by the owner's inability to otherwise make any economic use of the property. Increased financial return to the applicant shall not be considered just cause for a variation based on hardship. 
b.  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which apply to the property in question that do not apply to other properties in the drainage district and which have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
c.  In granting the variance, the building official may specify, in writing, such other conditions regarding the location, character, landscaping, or other treatment that will, in his/her judgment, be reasonably necessary to the furtherance of the intent of this section and the protection of the public interest. 
(4)  Maintenance and inspection. It shall be the duty of the applicant, owner, and occupant of the premises to maintain all stormwater retention facilities in accordance with the original plans and specifications, and to keep said facilities free of all health or safety hazards. The city engineer shall inspect all stormwater retention facilities prior to completion of construction and shall periodically reinspect all such facilities at such times as he/she may deem necessary to carry out the intent of this section. The city engineer or his/her duly authorized representatives are hereby authorized to enter upon any private premises for purposes of inspection. Any stormwater retention facility which is not constructed in accordance with the conditions of approval for the building permit, is not kept in good repair or becomes a health or safety hazard, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the city manager shall, following written notice to the owner, take such steps as, in his/her judgment, may be necessary to abate such nuisance. The cost of such abatement shall be charged against the premises, and the owner thereof, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13 of the Charter of the City of East Lansing. The applicant, owner, or occupant shall give such other information as reasonably may be required by the city engineer.

ARTICLE V. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE 

Sec. 34-201. - Title. 
(a)  This article shall be known as the "City of East Lansing Post Construction Stormwater Management Ordinance". 
(Ord. No. 1367, 2-16-2016) 
Sec. 34-202. - Findings. 
(a)  The City of East Lansing finds that: 
(1)  The constitution and laws of the State of Michigan authorizes local units of government to provide stormwater management services and systems that will contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare and to the protection of our natural resources. 
(2)  Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and downstream of the limits of the City of East Lansing are at times subjected to flooding. Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the City of East Lansing and the region. 
(3)  Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, increased sediment transport and deposition, and increased nonpoint source pollutant loading to the receiving water bodies and the Great Lakes. 
(4)  Stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. 
(5)  Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and have impacted the water resources of the Red Cedar River and the Looking Glass River Watersheds. 
(6)  Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the City of East Lansing will, absent proper regulation and control, adversely affect the city's water bodies and water resources, and those of downstream communities. 
(7)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development. 
(8)  Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. 
(9)  Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this article and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff. 
(10)  Substantial economic losses can result from adverse impacts on the waters of the City of East Lansing and the watershed. 
(11)  Improper design and construction of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation. 
(12)  The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities is necessary in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff. 
(13)  The regulation of land development activities by means of stormwater management policies and procedures and site design will help produce developments that are compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby help mitigate the adverse effects of stormwater runoff from the developments. 
(Ord. No. 1367, 2-16-2016) 
Sec. 34-203. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the City of East Lansing and the watersheds to which it drains and to comply with the city's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and other applicable federal and state regulations. 
(b)  This article seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and redevelopment through the following objectives: 
(1)  To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified land development and redevelopment. 
(2)  To minimize nonpoint source pollution. 
(3)  To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and bridges, and other structures. 
(4)  To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exists. 
(5)  To maintain the ecological integrity of stream channels. 
(6)  To minimize the impacts of development upon streambank and streambed stability. 
(7)  To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff pollution. 
(8)  To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and, to that end, this article establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient stormwater management controls. 
(9)  To ensure that storm drain drainage or stormwater BMPs are adequate to address stormwater management needs within a proposed development, and for protecting downstream landowners from further flooding and degradation of water quality. The procedures, standards, and recommendations set forth in this article and the City of East Lansing's Post Construction Stormwater Management Guidance Manual (Guidance Manual) are designed for these purposes. 
(10)  To ensure that all stormwater facilities necessary for a proposed development will have an appropriate governmental unit responsible in perpetuity for performing maintenance or for overseeing the performance of maintenance by a private entity, such as a property owners' association. 
(11)  To facilitate the integration of stormwater management and pollution control with other ordinances, programs, policies, and the comprehensive plans of the City of East Lansing. 
(12)  To establish legal authority to carry out all of the inspection and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(13)  To facilitate compliance with state and federal standards and permits by owners of construction sites, developments, and permanent stormwater BMPs with the City of East Lansing. 
(14)  To encourage the use of low impact development, green infrastructure, and integrated management practices, as practicable, in managing stormwater during and following development, and in meeting NPDES Phase 2 requirements. Also, to allow for incentives, as practicable, for projects that adopt these practices.

(5)  That this disclosure is necessary so that firefighters, and other emergency personnel responding to fires and other emergencies in structures which house such hazardous materials can respond appropriately and take measures to protect their own lives and the community. 
(6)  That this disclosure is also necessary so that the City of East Lansing may quickly respond to any fire or other emergency created by the handling, storage, use, processing, and disposal of hazardous materials; so that the source of such hazardous material may be quickly identified in the event of such an emergency; and so that the City of East Lansing may study and reevaluate its current zoning laws to determine the appropriate location of enterprises using such hazardous materials.

ARTICLE IV. - NEWS VENDING DEVICES 

Sec. 38-201. - Purpose and intent. 
    The City of East Lansing hereby finds and declares: 
(1)  The city has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks, that newsracks are properly maintained, and that newsracks do not create a visual blight in the city. 
(2)  In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on city streets, and particularly poorly maintained or abandoned free-standing newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property, resulted in visual blight, and hindered the ability of public services such as sidewalk and street cleaning. Certain newsracks have been placed in inappropriate locations, have been abandoned, are poorly maintained, and have been used as trash receptacles causing unsightly and unsanitary clutter and litter. 
(3)  The city has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities as identified in the City of East Lansing Master Plan. To that end, it is in the best interest of the city to take steps to solve and reduce the negative effects of this problem. 
(4)  After conducting an extensive study and inquiry into this problem, it has become clear that an effective way to remedy this problem is to require that all newspapers and other publications desiring to be sold or distributed in newspaper racks on city sidewalks or other public property or rights-of-way be placed in and sold from modular units which are provided by the city at locations commensurate with the locations at which newspapers and other publications are currently being sold or distributed. 
(5)  The purpose of this article is to accomplish the following: 
a.  Provide for increased pedestrian and vehicular safety and convenience; 
b.  Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
c.  Ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly located newsracks; 
d.  Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, police or fire call boxes, sidewalk elevators, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb ramps, parking meters, and locations used for public transportation services; 
e.  Reduce visual blight, clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained, improperly located or abandoned newsracks; 
f.  Protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city; 
g.  Advance the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents, including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of newspapers and news periodicals through newsracks; and 
h.  Prevent newsracks from unduly interfering with city sidewalk and street cleaners as well as other public services. 
(6)  In adopting this article, the city is mindful that regulation of newsracks implicates rights protected by the Constitution of both the United States and the State of Michigan. To that end, this article was drafted and shall be applied and enforced in a manner consistent with these constitutional rights. The content or viewpoint of the material to be distributed through modular newsrack units shall not be considered in administering or enforcing this article. 
(7)  Given the limited space available and the increasing congestion on certain public sidewalks, streets and rights-of-way, the city has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack placement in those locales to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers and other publications. This objective may be achieved by providing modular newsrack units in certain locations in the city. Utilizing newsrack units and prohibiting free-standing newsracks will promote the city's interest in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city, and advancing the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion. 
(8)  A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this article, which reasonably regulates the placement of newsracks in specified areas.

If a publication fails to pay the required fee within 30 days after it becomes due, the city manager shall provide written notice that registration will be revoked and the newsrack box removed if the fee is not paid within ten days of this notice. If the fee is not paid within ten days, registration shall be revoked and the newsrack box removed.

Newsracks that are not claimed within 30 calendar days of impoundment shall be disposed of in a manner determined by the city manager in accordance with state law. The owner of an unauthorized newsrack shall be responsible for restoring the sidewalk to its original condition if damaged by the unauthorized newsrack.

The escrow deposit shall be for the estimated time period necessary to complete the required public improvements. In the case of either cash deposits or a certified check, an agreement between the city manager and the subdivider may provide for progressive payments out of the cash deposit or reduction of the certified check to the extent of the estimated cost of the completed portion of the required improvements. The escrow agreement may provide that the subdivider may receive any interest payable on the deposit. 
(3)  Irrevocable bank letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank authorized to do business in Michigan shall be deposited with the city treasurer to cover the cost of required improvements as estimated by the city engineer. The city manager may authorize rebatement or release to the subdivider, as the work progresses, of amounts equal to the ratio of the completed and accepted work to the entire project. 
(b)  Contractual arrangements. The subdivider may enter into a contract with the City of East Lansing for the completion of the required public improvements. 
(c)  Inspections. Inspectors authorized by the city will review construction of all required improvements as necessary. It shall be the responsibility of the improvement contractor(s) to notify the office of the city engineer at least two days in advance for the following periodic inspections: 
(1)  Storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, mains, laterals, and catchbasins before the trenches are backfilled. 
(2)  Forms set for curb and gutter after the sub-base has been put in place and before any concrete has been poured. 
(3)  Forms set for sidewalks before any concrete has been poured. 
(4)  All subgrade that has been shaped and rolled before the compaction test has been made. 
(5)  Forms for pavement before any concrete has been poured. 
(6)  All base courses and final installations. 
No work covered by the guarantees shall be accepted or guarantees released until these inspections have been made and work found to be satisfactory. 
(d)  Failure to install improvements. In case the subdivider shall fail to install the required public improvements within such time period as required by the conditions or guarantees as outlined above, the city council may proceed to have such work completed and reimburse itself for the cost therefor by appropriating the cash deposit, or certified check, or by drawing upon the letter of credit, or shall take the necessary steps to require completion by the bonding company. 
(Code 1994, ch. 56, § 5.362)

All such landscape plans shall be submitted to the planning commission with the final plat and formally approved by the city council. 
(5)  Sidewalks and walkways. Each subdivision shall provide concrete sidewalks five feet in width on both sides of the street and where pedestrian walkways are required. Such sidewalks and walkways shall be constructed in conformance with the construction specifications of the city engineering department. Sidewalk construction may be delayed so that the construction will be closely related to house construction. Additional time periods shall be determined by the city engineer, subject to suitable improvement guarantees. 
(6)  Alleys. Alleys, where permitted, shall be paved to their full right-of-way in conformance with the construction specifications of the city engineering department.

(Code 1994, ch. 126, § 8.32.4; Ord. No. 968, 3-20-2001; Ord. No. 1007, 3-19-2002; Ord. No. 1370, 5-10-2016) 
Sec. 44-336. - Process.(8.32.5) 
    The following process shall be followed to establish a resident permit parking program except for the two permit parking areas currently established by Traffic Control Order No. 246 and No. 264, where it shall be presumed that the criteria relating to eligibility, engineering study, and resident support of the permit program required by section 8.32.4 [section 44-335] and section 8.32.5(1), (2), (3), and (4) [section 44-336] have been fulfilled and that more than 25 percent of the addresses support the proposed RPP program, as required by subsection 8.32.5(5) [section 44-336]. All other provisions specified herein shall apply to existing permit parking areas. 
(1)  Residents of an area who feel that they are or a neighborhood association which determines that a particular area within the neighborhood is adversely affected by a shortage of reasonably available on-street parking may request permit parking by submitting a petition, as described in this section, signed by 30 percent of the property owners in the proposed permit parking area. 
(2)  The petition shall include: 
a)  A map with a designation of the specific streets proposed for permit parking. 
b)  The printed name, signature, date signed and street address of each property owner who signed the petition. 
c)  The specific problem the permit parking area will address. 
d)  The proposed permit parking restrictions including the hours, days, dates or events, or any combination thereof, that the petitioners desire to see restricted to residential permit parking. 
e)  The rules that residents in the residential parking permit area will be required to follow, including the fees they will pay for resident parking permits, the number of guest permits available, and the process for obtaining resident parking permits and guest permits. 
f)  A list of other available parking restrictions that residents could pursue as an alternative to a residential permit parking system. 
g)  The name and address of the person who is circulating the petition. 
Petition forms shall be available in the city clerk's office, which illustrate the types of restrictions available for residential permit parking and the required information for a valid petition. 
(3)  The petitions shall be submitted to the clerk for verification of the form and the sufficiency of the number of signatures. Any signatures dated six months before submission shall not be counted. If there are an insufficient number of signatures or other impropriety in the form, the petitions shall be returned to the person that submitted them. If the petitions are in proper form and have sufficient signatures, they shall be forwarded to the city engineer who shall study the request to assess the nature and extent of the parking problem as well as determine the ramifications of implementing a RPP program. At a minimum, the city engineer's parking study shall include: 
a)  The total number of legal parking spaces in the proposed residential parking permit area. The number of spaces will be determined using an average parking space length of 20 feet, ensuring one foot buffers on either side of driveway curb cuts are maintained and that other necessary space is provided in order to maintain sufficient line of sight for drivers. 
b)  The names of individual streets and the number of households making up the proposed residential permit parking area as a whole. 
c)  At least 15 counts of the number of vehicles parked in the area as a whole and on the individual streets making it up. The vehicle counts shall be taken at a representative mix of days and times during MSU events, other community events or other times that were identified in the petition that were identified in the petition as causing a lack of available residential parking in the petition for a neighborhood parking permit area. 
(4)  If the city engineer determines that the study results meet the eligibility requirements established in section 8.32.4 [section 44-335], the city engineer shall develop a draft "supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan," and provide the completed parking study and the draft parking plan to the transportation commission, the petitioners and an applicable neighborhood association, if any. This plan shall describe those unique obligations, conditions, and requirements specific to the proposed permit parking area. It will also address such issues as the maximum number of permits which could be issued to businesses and residents and delineate the specific boundaries of the permit area and streets contained therein. The plan shall be reviewed by the city treasurer, chief of police, and city attorney. Insofar as possible, comments provided by such offices shall be incorporated into the plan prior to its submittal for a public hearing. However, in any case, the plan shall not establish conditions or requirements which are in conflict with this resident permit parking code. 
(5)  The city engineer shall establish a date for a transportation commission public hearing on the proposed residential parking permit. The city engineer shall mail the draft supplemental plan to all properties in the residential neighborhood in which the plan would take effect, and its neighborhood association, if any, with notice of the public hearing at least 14 days before the hearing. At the hearing, the transportation commission shall review all aspects and implications of the proposed RPP program. 
The transportation commission may then refine and modify the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan based on information provided at the public hearing and on comments received from city departments, individual citizens, the neighborhood association, if any, and the city attorney. During formulation of the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan, the transportation commission shall take reasonable steps to assure itself that the interest of all neighborhood residents have been adequately represented. 
(6)  At the completion of such a review hearing, if the commission determines that there is a sufficient basis to proceed based on the criteria established in section 8.32.4 [section 44-335], it shall direct the city engineer to prepare a voting ballot describing, in general terms, the RPP program and the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan. The ballot shall clearly indicate that a majority of the returned ballots must indicate support for the proposed plan and that the city council retains authority to further alter the plan during its review of it. One ballot shall be mailed to each address on affected properties. Eligible voters and the number of votes which can be cast on behalf of the "affected properties" shall be determined as follows: 
a)  Each affected property, whether abutting or non-abutting to the permit parking street, shall receive one vote for each parcel of property. 
b)  Votes for one-family or two-family dwellings and class A and B multiple dwelling properties shall be cast by the property owner. 
c)  Votes for business properties shall be cast by the owner, or owner's representative, of the property on which the business is located. 
(7)  Ballots shall be signed by the voter and returned to the city engineer within 30 days after mailing. In order to continue with the process of establishing a RPP program, a majority of the ballots returned must indicate support for the RPP program. 
(8)  If the conditions established in subsection (7) above are fulfilled, the city engineer shall forward the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan to city council for consideration. 
(9)  The city engineer shall prepare a proposed ordinance which, if adopted, would establish a permit parking area in accordance with the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan and submit that, with the entire record of the process, to city council. City council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance. All residents of affected properties and those within one block of affected properties and all owners of affected properties and the applicable neighborhood association, if any, shall be mailed a notice of the public hearing at least 14 days before the date of the public hearing. If at the conclusion of the public hearing, based on the record of the process and the information provided at the public hearing, city council determines that the eligibility requirements of section 8.32.4 [section 44-335] have been met and a permit parking area and permit parking plan would benefit the residents of all or a portion of the proposed permit parking area, city council may: (a) approve a permit parking area for all or that portion of the proposed permit parking area that the city council determines would benefit the residents; and (b) based upon the record provided and the information provided at the public hearing, make any other modifications to the proposed ordinance concerning the issuance of permits and the particular permit parking restrictions that it deems appropriate. If approved by city council, this code shall be amended to establish permit parking for the area. Such area shall be designated by name and those streets along which permit parking is to be established shall be listed in section 8.33.2 [section 44-343]. The supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan, as approved by city council, shall also be contained within section 8.33.2 [section 44-343]. 
(10)  Once established, upon petition signed by an owner of a majority of the properties of any portion of an established permit parking area at least one block in length or an entire established permit parking area, residents of that area or an applicable neighborhood association, if any, may request an amendment to the permit parking plan. Upon certification of the petitions by the city clerk, the transportation commission shall hold a public hearing on the request. All residents of the area proposed for an amendment to a permit parking area shall be mailed a notice of the public hearing at least 14 days before the date of the public hearing. The transportation commission shall make a determination whether current parking plan restrictions no longer are justified for a significant portion of the residents and that a plan change or area change will not adversely affect other residents or the intent and purpose of the permit parking area. The transportation commission shall then convey a recommendation to city council with its finding and specific recommendations for or against changes to the permit parking plan. 
Upon receipt of the recommendation of the transportation commission regarding change(s) to a permit parking plan, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the request. All residents of the area proposed for permit parking shall be mailed a notice of the public hearing at least 14 days before the date of the public hearing. If the city council finds that current permit parking plan restrictions no longer are justified for a significant portion of the residents and a plan change does not adversely affect other residents or the intent and purpose of the permit parking area, city council may make any changes to the permit parking plan, the permit parking restrictions, or the permit parking area it deems appropriate. 
(11)  All affected properties shall be eligible to participate in the permit program in accordance with the provisions of this code and the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan. 
(12)  Annual renewal of a permit program shall be automatic unless: 
a)  A petition requesting termination is received from at least two-thirds of the affected properties; or 
b)  The transportation commission finds that resident participation in the RPP program is inadequate to justify its continuation; or 
c)  The transportation commission finds that the eligibility criteria established in section 8.32.4 [section 44-335] no longer apply to the permit area. 
(13)  If the transportation commission makes a recommendation to city council regarding termination of the RPP program for an area, the city council shall schedule a public hearing on the matter and notify residents and neighborhood associations in the same manner utilized to establish a supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan (section 44-336). At the hearing the city council may (a) approve a termination or (b) modify the current parking plan. 
    This amendatory ordinance shall take effect upon its adoption and publication as required by Charter and shall be effective as to all circulated petitions which have been submitted to the program administrator on or after October 1, 1996.

Sec. 44-337. - Area addition and/or modifications to the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan.(8.32.6) 
    Expansions to boundaries of existing permit areas shall be made according to the procedures outlined in section 8.32.5 [section 44-336], provided that the area being added meets all eligibility requirements specified in section 8.32.4 [section 44-335], except for criteria specified in section 8.32.4(2) [section 44-335]. Modifications to the supplemental neighborhood permit parking plan shall be made according to the procedures outlined in section 8.32.5 [section 44-336], beginning with section 8.32.5(6) [section 44-336].

(d)  Further provided, however, that in cases where the property to be connected to the sewer main has not participated (other than by payment of the city's general property tax) in the cost of or been assessed by special assessment for such sewer main serving said property, in those additional areas of the city described in section 1.02 of the Amended 1984 PA 425 Agreement between the City of East Lansing and DeWitt Charter Township dated June 11, 2001, described as Areas 3 and 4, and all that portion of Area 5 lying east of Coolidge Road, and in all other areas of the city not described in subsections (b), (c), (e) and (f) of this section, the following additional capital charges shall be paid prior to the making of any service connection: 
(1)  Per single-family house ..... $710.00 
(2)  Per manufactured house ..... 510.00 
(3)  Per multifamily dwelling unit ..... 355.00 
(4)  Per acre of office or commercial development ..... 4,260.00 
(e)  Further provided, however, that in cases where the property to be connected to the sewer main has not participated (other than by payment of the city's general property tax) in the cost of or been assessed by special assessment for such sewer main serving said property in those areas of the city described in section 1.02 of the Amended 1984 PA 425 Agreement between the City of East Lansing and DeWitt Charter Township dated June 11, 2001, described as that portion of Area 2 lying south of the abandoned New York Central Railroad right-of-way and that portion of Area 5 lying west of Coolidge Road, the following additional capital charges shall be paid prior to the making of any service connection for such property based upon a cost per acre (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of an acre) of $29,045.00 per acre. 
(f)  Further provided, however, that in cases where the property to be connected to the city's sewer system is ultimately connected to and/or serviced by the 36-inch diameter combined sewer constructed in 2012 in Albert Avenue from Charles Street to Grove Street, the following additional sanitary flow portion and storm flow portion capital charges shall be paid prior to the making of any service connections: 
Sanitary flow portion of connection fee = $3,042.00 × 1.03 (t) × increase in EM 
Storm flow portion of connection fee = $73,026.00 × 1.03 (t) × increase in CA 
For purposes of these calculations, the following apply: 
(1)  1.03 (t) means 1.03 to the power of (t). The power of (t) is calculated as follows: Present year - 2012 = t. For example, present year = 2017, t = 2017-2012 = 5 so it would be 1.03 (5) . 
(2)  Increase in EM refers to the increase in the "Equivalent Water Service Meter Size" in accordance with the following table: 
5/8 × 3/4 inch meter-EM=1.0 
1 inch meter-EM=2.5 
11/2 inch meter-EM= 5.0 
2 inch meter-EM=8.0 
3 inch meter-EM=22.5 
4 inch meter-EM=50.0 
6 inch meter-EM=100.0 
For example, increasing from a one-inch meter with an EM of 2.5 to a two-inch meter with an EM of 8.0 would result in an increase in EM of 5.5 (8.0-2.5). Using 2017 as the example year, the entire calculation would be $3,042.00 × 1.03 (5) × 5.5 for a sanitary flow portion of the connection fee of $19,395.81. 
(3)  CA means the total area of the parcel in acres ("A") times the average percent increase of the imperviousness of that parcel ("C"). For example a two-acre parcel that increases in average imperviousness by 25 percent would equal a CA of .5 (2x.25). Using 2017 as the example year, the entire calculation would be $73,026.00 × 1.03 (5) × .5 for a storm flow portion of the connection fee of $42,328.57.

Credit for generic pollutants, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
(f)  Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than one year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in subdivision III of this division are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his/her permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(g)  Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned, or transferred, or sold to a new owner, new source, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of all existing permits. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.2) 
Sec. 46-155. - Reporting requirements for permittee. 
(a)  Generally. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any categorical user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow in gallons per day from regulated process streams and such other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) and identifying the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. In addition, the report shall include the results of sampling and analysis, identifying the nature and concentration (or mass where required) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be taken in the frequency and manner provided by 40 CFR 403(12)(b)(5). The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new user, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the city, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standard. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by variable techniques. At the discretion of the superintendent in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent, for good cause shown, may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(2)  If the superintendent has imposed mass limitations on users, the report required by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, the report required by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. Reports of users shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standard. The report shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed by the superintendent to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. (Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluent for Priority Pollutants , April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator.) 
(3)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(c)  Reporting requirements for noncategorical discharges. Industrial users with discharges which are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit such reports as the superintendent deems necessary to verify compliance with all of the general discharge limitations and prohibitions of this Code. 
(d)  Baseline monitoring report. At least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the superintendent a report which contains estimates of the measured average daily and maximum daily flow of process streams and waste streams and flow and amount of regulated pollutants in the form and containing the information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(5), and shall include in this report information on the method of pretreatment intended to be used to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. 
(e)  Signatory requirements. All reports required by this section shall contain the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and shall be signed as follows: 
(1)  By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user submitting the reports required by subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section is a corporation. For the purpose of this subsection, a responsible corporate officer means: 
a.  A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or 
b.  The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operation facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25,000,000.00 (in second quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures. 
(2)  By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user submitting the reports required by subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section is a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively. 
(3)  By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in subsection (e)(1) or (2) of this section if: 
a.  The authorization is made in writing by the individual described in subsection (e)(1) or (2). 
b.  The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well, or wellfield superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
c.  The written authorization is submitted to the city. 
(4)  If an authorization under subsection (e)(3) of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of subsections (e)(1) through (3) of this section must be submitted to the city prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.3) 
Sec. 46-156. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  When required by the city, a user shall provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the city. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.4) 
Sec. 46-157. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, MDNR, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, MDNR, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.5) 
Sec. 46-158. - Pretreatment. 
(a)  Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  The city shall annually publish in the Towne Courier newspaper a list of the users which had significantly violated any pretreatment requirements or standards during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months. 
(c)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.6) 
Sec. 46-159. - Bypass of pretreatment facilities. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the city within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The supervisor may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facility, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance. 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.7) 
Sec. 46-160. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(b)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the state disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment programs, provided however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 4.8) 
Sec. 46-161. - Harmful contributions. 
(a)  The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or the environment, causes interference to the POTW, or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
(b)  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of occurrence. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 5.1) 
Sec. 46-162. - Revocation of discharge permit.

    Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the reduction in the amount of a pollutant, or alteration of the nature of the pollutant, by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits and the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. Any user requesting application for modification shall reimburse the city for all costs of testing and date compilation required by 40 CFR 403.7. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 2.6) 
Sec. 46-197. - Alternate calculation of limits. 
    When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(1)  When calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations under this section, the superintendent shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather, upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual longterm daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. 
(2)  When calculating equivalent concentration limitations under subsection (3) of this section, the superintendent shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived under subsection (3) of this section by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year. 
(3)  Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act and this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(4)  If categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average limitations, where applied, the same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating both types of equivalent limitations. 
(5)  Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the superintendent within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 2.7) 
Sec. 46-198. - Dilution of discharge prohibited. 
    Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Code 1994, ch. 24A, § 2.9) 
Sec. 46-199. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Protection from accidental discharges. All categorical and noncategorical industrial/commercial users with the potential to discharge toxic substances or prohibited pollutants in amounts which may interfere with the operation of the POTW shall provide necessary protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense upon request of the city. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review when required, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users who are required to provide such a plan shall complete such a plan by May 1, 1985. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of all categorical and noncategorical users to telephone immediately (within 24 hours) and notify the POTW of the incident. The location shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(b)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
(c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedures.

Sec. 48-91. - Findings. 
    The city council finds the following: 
(1)  Regulation of the removal or alteration of trees, shrubs, forest resources, other forms of existing vegetation and topography will protect important physical, aesthetic, recreational, and economic assets for both present and future generations of the City of East Lansing; and 
(2)  Trees, shrubs, forest resources, and other forms of existing vegetation are essential components to the general welfare of the city by providing natural beauty, natural character, recreational opportunities, and wildlife habitat and by protecting public health through the absorption of airborne pollutants and generation of oxygen, through the reduction of excessive noise pollution, through their cooling properties in the summer months and through their root systems, stabilizing the soil, playing an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; and 
(3)  Disturbance or alteration of existing topography impacts drainage ways which can contribute to erosion and damage to adjacent properties if undertaken without prior site review to assure that proper measures are installed to prevent or reduce erosion or damage; and 
(4)  In order to assure the adequate assessment and preservation of parcels in the course of granting of land use approvals under the East Lansing City Code, parcels must remain undisturbed by clearing, grading and removal of vegetation prior to the review and issuance of any permits, approvals, special use permits or variances; and 
(5)  Incorporating existing mature trees and natural vegetation into new land use development enhances the quality of the environment for the occupants of the property, minimizes the costs to develop and landscape the property and minimizes adverse impacts on adjacent properties.

Chapter 49 - WETLAND PROTECTION 

Sec. 49-1. - Findings. 
    The city council finds the following: 
(1)  Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources that provide many public benefits, including maintenance of water quality through nutrient cycling and sediment trapping as well as flood and storm water runoff control through temporary water storage, slow release, and groundwater recharge. In addition, wetlands provide open space; passive outdoor recreation opportunities; fish and wildlife habitat for many forms of wildlife, including migratory waterfowl and rare, threatened or endangered wildlife and plant species; and pollution treatment by serving as biological and chemical oxidation basins. 
(2)  Preservation of the remaining city wetlands in a natural condition shall be and is necessary to maintain hydrological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic natural resource values for existing and future residents of the city, and therefore the city council declares a policy of no net loss of wetlands. Furthermore, the city council declares a long-term goal of net gain of wetlands to be accomplished through review of degraded or destroyed wetlands in the city, and, through cooperative work with landowners, using incentives and voluntary agreements to restore wetlands. 
(3)  Pursuant to Article 4, Section 52 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan, the conservation and development of natural resources of the state is a matter of paramount public concern in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people. Therefore, with authority from Section 30307(4) of Part 303, Wetlands Protection, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended (Act 451), the city council finds that this chapter is essential to the long term health, safety, economic, and general welfare of the people of the city and to the furtherance of the policies set forth in Part 17 of Act 451.

(1)  Prior to considering a proposal for wetland mitigation, the applicant shall show that it is practical to replace the wetland resource values which will be unavoidably impacted including: flood prevention; wildlife habitat; groundwater resource protection and recharge; pollution treatment; erosion control; nutrient sources; aesthetics; recreation; open space and any other values identified. 
(2)  If the above is met, the following criteria shall be considered when reviewing an applicant's mitigation proposal: 
a.  Mitigation shall be provided on-site where practical and beneficial to the wetland resources. If mitigation on-site is not practical and beneficial, then mitigation in the immediate vicinity, within the same watershed, of the permitted activity may be considered. Only if all of these options are impractical shall mitigation be considered elsewhere. 
b.  Any proposal shall assure that there will be no net loss to the wetland resource values. 
c.  The mitigation plan must comply will all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including the applicable rules and standards promulgated by the MDEQ pursuant to MCL 324.30319. 
d.  A plan to monitor preserved and replacement wetlands over a minimum of five years has been specified. 
(3)  Wetland mitigation and monitoring plans shall become conditions to the wetland use permit and shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
(4)  Financial assurances that mitigation is accomplished as specified by the permit condition may be required by the city engineer or city council, as applicable.

(f)  The building official shall make a final inspection of all buildings after completion, before occupancy begins, upon receiving notice from the owner, contractor, or his/her or its agent, that said building is ready for such final inspection.

(g)  Whenever it is found that a permit has been issued in violation of this chapter or any other chapter of the City Code or state law, or in consequence of a false statement or misrepresentation of conditions, or whenever it is found that work is not being performed in accordance with the plans and specifications on which the permit issued is based, the building official shall notify the person to whom the permit was issued to appear before him/her at a stated time and place and show cause why the permit shall not be revoked.

An appeal to the zoning board of appeals prior to the expiration date shall stay the expiration of the permit until final action by the board.

(4)  Written notification of city council's action shall be transmitted by the city clerk to the applicant and the planning and zoning official within five days of the action or the expiration of the 20-day review period. 
(i)  Granting of permits. After approval of the site plan in accordance with the procedures in this section, the applicant shall submit a final site plan to the planning and zoning official. The final site plan shall comply with the city council approval and incorporate any conditions of approval. The applicant shall also secure and submit copies of all required zoning variances, wetland use permits, and permits or approvals from other agencies. 
(1)  The grading, clearing and site construction elements of the final site plan shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer in accordance with applicable regulations and specifications. 
(2)  When the city engineer has approved the final site plan, the planning and zoning official shall determine if the final site plan continues to comply with the city council approval, and if so, shall forward certified copies of the final site plan to the building official and the city engineer. If the final site plan does not comply with the city council approval, the final site plan shall be processed in accordance with the provisions governing modifications as specified in subsection (k) of this section. 
(3)  When the site grading, clearing and site construction elements of the final site plan have been approved by the city engineer and all required zoning variances, wetland use permits, and permits or approvals from other agencies have been secured, the planning and zoning official may certify those portions of the final site plan. The planning and zoning official may defer action on other elements, such as final landscaping and site lighting plans, that may be submitted and approved at a later date. 
(4)  Upon receipt of the certified site plan, or a portion thereof, the city engineer and/or building official may issue a grading/soil erosion and sedimentation control permit, tree removal/land clearing permit, building permit, or other required permits in accordance with other applicable city codes and procedures. 
(5)  If the building official issues a temporary occupancy permit before all required site improvements have been completed, the building official may require that a cash deposit, certified check or irrevocable bank letter of credit in an amount equal to the city engineer's estimated cost of the uncompleted improvements be deposited with the city to insure the timely completion of the required improvements. Upon request, the building official may rebate portions of the cash deposit or certified check as improvements are satisfactorily completed or, with a letter of credit, the building official may allow the original one on file to be replaced with a new letter of credit. When all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed by the applicant, the final guarantee shall be returned by the building official. 
(6)  The authorities and responsibilities of the city engineer and the building official shall, with respect to applications having been approved pursuant to this section, be the same as for other applications for grading/soil erosion and sedimentation control permits, tree removal/land clearing permits, wetland use permits, building permits and certificates of occupancy submitted for its approval, and nothing in this section shall be constructed to abrogate such authority and responsibility. 
(j)  Time limit of approval. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the site plan approval shall remain valid for 12 months from the date of its approval by the city council. If work on the proposed development has not begun within the 12-month limit, the approval shall automatically become null and void and all rights thereunder shall lapse; except that upon written application filed at least one month prior to the expiration of the 12-month limit, the planning commission may authorize a single 12-month extension of the time limit. Once work on the proposed development site has begun, it shall be completed in accordance with the provisions and limits or extended limits of section 50-35(h) of this chapter. For developments which include two or more principal buildings or otherwise include improvements which are to be constructed in phases, each phase shall be considered as a separate project for the purposes of section 50-35(h). 
(k)  Modifications of approved site plans as described under section 50-37(1) and approved building plans as described under section 50-37(6) or existing developments. The planning and zoning official may administratively approve applications to modify previously approved site plans, or to expand or convert the use of buildings or site improvements which legally existed prior to the adoption of this section, which meet all of the following standards: 
(1)  The modification would comply with all other requirements of this chapter and other applicable regulations; 
(2)  The modification would comply with all previously imposed conditions of approval, if any; 
(3)  The modification would not otherwise increase the overall scale or intensity of the use in a way that would have a material adverse effect on adjacent properties, natural features, public streets or public services; 
(4)  The modification would not increase by more than five percent any or all of the following characteristics of the property: the total floor area of building(s); the total residential occupancy; or the total number of parking spaces required or provided; and 
(5)  The modification would not decrease by more than five percent any of the principal building setbacks from the perimeter of the property. 
(6)  The modification would not materially alter the approved architectural style, façade materials to be used, window size or overall window area more than five percent, or other architectural features and adornments. 
    An application to modify an approved site plan or to expand or convert the use of an existing building which does not meet the standards above may be referred to the city council for consideration if the modifications would not result in a significant change to the site plan and would otherwise be recommended for approval by the planning and zoning official. An application to modify an approved site plan that is not administratively approved or referred to the city council pursuant to this section shall be treated as a new application and must be approved in accordance with the procedures and standards of this section and section 50-38. In determining if an application to modify an approved site plan or to expand or convert the use of an existing building meets the standards above, the planning and zoning official may consult with other departments or agencies or seek guidance from the planning commission or city council. 
(l)  Concept plan approval. Before submitting one or more detailed site plan applications, a developer may choose to submit a proposed concept plan for review and approval. The purpose of concept plan approval is to determine whether the extent, nature and layout of the development would conform to the city's comprehensive plan and other land use policies and likely comply with the standards of this chapter and other applicable regulations, once detailed site plans are prepared and submitted. Concept plan approval signifies that the city finds the extent and nature of the development and the proposed arrangement of uses and improvements on the property are acceptable, subject to any conditions of approval and the ultimate compliance of the development to all requirements of this chapter and other relevant local policies and regulations. 
(1)  An application for concept plan approval shall provide sufficient information about the proposed development to make a determination consistent with the purpose of this review. The application shall address all the submission requirements specified in section 50-37, although it is expected that the level of detail of the design will be schematic in character. At a minimum, the application shall include the following information: 
a.  The size of the property and general site conditions. 
b.  The approximate location, size and occupancy of all proposed buildings; 
c.  The approximate location, extent, and nature of any natural features on the site; 
d.  The proposed location of streets, driveways and parking areas to provide access and serve each building; 
e.  The proposed extension of utilities necessary to serve the overall site; 
f.  Any other proposed facilities to be provided on the site; 
g.  Other information as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the review; 
h.  The fee specified in section 50-32 of this chapter. 
(2)  The schematic development plan application shall be processed in accordance with subsections (f) through (h) of this section and reviewed in accordance with the standards of review provided in section 50-38. 
(3)  An approved schematic development plan shall remain valid for 18 months from the date of its approval by the city council. If a formal application for site plan approval for at least a portion of the proposed development has not been submitted within the 18-month limit, the approval shall automatically become null and void and all rights thereunder shall lapse; except that upon written application filed at least one month prior to the expiration of the 18-month limit, the planning commission may authorize a single extension of the time limit of not more than 12 months. 
(m)  Phased development. Where a parcel is intended to be divided into several building sites, such as a site condominium, or the development would consist of two or more buildings, or the property would otherwise be developed in phases, the developer(s) may choose to submit site plans for each phase separately. At a minimum, the applicant shall initially submit an overall concept plan for the entire site, as provided for in subsection (l) of this section; the applicant may also simultaneously submit a detailed site plan application for one or more portions of the site. When the concept plan and any initial site plan have been approved, detailed site plans for each subsequent phase(s) shall be submitted for review and approval. Each subsequent phase shall be considered as an amendment to the overall site plan for the parcel. The initial phase and each subsequent phase shall comply with the requirements of this chapter and be designed to function properly should subsequent phases not be developed. 
(n)  Procedures. Procedures for the processing and review of applications for site plan approval as required by this section shall be approved by the planning commission and shall be made available, in written form, to applicants for site plan approval. 
(o)  Site plan compliance. It shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of the property to construct all structures in conformity with the approved site plans, including but not limited to the approved building elevations showing the size, height, architectural style, materials, colors, and window sizes and locations and to use and maintain the property in compliance with the approved site plan and all conditions of approval. All elements of the approved plan shall be maintained in safe and usable condition and shall promptly be repaired and/or replaced as needed. The planning and zoning official shall make periodic inspections of each site to ensure that the sites remain in compliance with the approved site plan. The violation, enforcement and penalty provisions of section 50-33 of this chapter shall apply. The building official shall issue a stop work order upon the planning and zoning official's request for any structure that is being constructed contrary to the approved site plan.

Sec. 50-38. - Standards of review for site plan approval. 
    A site plan application shall meet the development standards of the use district in which it is to be located and all other required conditions for development in this chapter, comply with other applicable local ordinances and state and federal statutes, and be consistent with the objectives of the comprehensive plan as approved and amended by the city. A site plan application shall also substantially comply with the standards of review specified below. A site plan may be approved subject to certain conditions or modifications necessary to bring the plan into conformance with these requirements, including the approval of any variance that may be granted by the zoning board of appeals. 
(1)  General site conditions. The site shall be designed and developed to provide a logical relationship between functional elements, to effectively serve the purposes for which it is to be developed, and to be reasonably compatible with surrounding properties. 
a.  The size, height, design and architectural treatment of buildings shall be reasonably compatible with surrounding properties; except, if the site is in an area which is expected to redevelop in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive plan, the size, height, design and architectural treatment of buildings shall be consistent with the objectives in the comprehensive plan. 
b.  Buildings, including windows, balconies and other openings, shall be located and designed to provide reasonable privacy for residents and employees on the site and those adjacent to the site; buffers such as walls, fencing, landscape plantings or additional setbacks may be required to protect residents and employees from adverse impacts from adjacent uses or streets. 
c.  Yard areas on the site shall be arranged and improved to provide adequate light and ventilation; separation between buildings, roads and other activity areas; trees and other vegetation; passive and active recreational areas; and to improve the appearance of the property, ensure reasonable privacy and enjoyment for residents and employees and promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
d.  Outdoor activity areas, such as pools, playgrounds, courts, cooking or dining facilities, shall be located and screened sufficiently to minimize impacts on adjacent properties or dwelling units on the site and to provide appropriate security. 
(2)  Natural features. The site shall be designed and developed to minimize the disruption or loss of its desirable natural elements and to enhance its overall appearance by incorporating those elements into required open spaces and setbacks. 
a.  The design and placement of buildings, other site improvements and open space shall respect the natural topography of the site to minimize the extent of site grading, excavation and filling. 
b.  Mature trees and significant clusters of trees and shrubs shall be retained where possible to provide shade for buildings and over parking areas and driveways, to maintain privacy between adjacent properties and to enhance the appearance of the site. 
c.  Within a regulated wetland, no filling, grading, dredging, excavating, draining or construction shall be permitted unless the required permit is first obtained from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and/or the city in accordance with chapter 49 of the City Code. Existing wetland areas not regulated by the state or the city and surface drainageways shall be preserved to the maximum practicable extent to maintain stormwater control, water quality, natural habitat and open space. 
d.  Buildings and other site improvements shall be set back an appropriate distance from the perimeter of preserved natural features to protect them from encroachment, damage, degradation or pollution, both during and after construction, to preserve the aesthetic and functional values of the resources and to provide access to use and maintain the site improvements. All construction activities within the drip line of existing trees shall be minimized to avoid damage to their root systems. Buildings and other site improvements shall be set back from the edge of a wetland or other surface water feature the following minimum distances: 
_____ 
Setbacks from preserved wetlands and other surface water features: Minimum distance: Principal buildings ..... 25 feet Accessory buildings and site features supported by frost footings ..... 15 feet Decks, stairways and other features supported by post footings ..... 10 feet Parking areas, driveways and curbing ..... 15 feet Sidewalks, patios and other flatwork ..... 10 feet Stormwater collection, detention or retention facilities ..... 10 feet  
_____ 
A vegetation strip at least ten feet wide consisting of plant species that are consistent with a wetland habitat shall be provided and maintained around the perimeter of a preserved wetland or surface water feature. Existing trees, shrubs and ground cover may be preserved within this strip or appropriate trees, shrubs and other perennial species native to a Michigan wetland habitat shall be installed to enhance the strip. Once established, this strip shall not be mowed or clear cut, except for vegetation that requires cutting to reseed and maintain healthy growth, and trees and shrubs may be selectively pruned to maintain views of the wetland or water feature and to protect and maintain access to buildings and other site improvements. Pathways no more that ten feet in width may be cleared and maintained to provide access to the wetland or surface water feature. Observation decks or docks may also be permitted to allow viewing of the water feature or wetland. 
The setback and vegetation strip requirements in this subsection may be increased or decreased if it is determined that a proposed activity is in the public interest. In determining whether the proposed activity is in the public interest, the benefit which would reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposal shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the construction or activity, taking into consideration the local, state and national concern for the protection and preservation of the environmental feature in question. The following general criteria shall be applied in undertaking this balancing test: 
1.  The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed activity. 
2.  The availability of feasible and prudent alternative locations and methods to accomplish the expected benefits from the activity. 
3.  The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects which the proposed activity may have on the public and private use to which the area is suited, including the benefits the natural feature and/or natural feature open space provides. 
4.  The probable impact of the activity in relation to the cumulative effect created by other existing and anticipated activities in or near the natural feature to be protected. 
5.  The probable impact on recognized historic, cultural, scenic, ecological, or recreational values, and on fish, wildlife and public health. 
6.  The size and quantity of the natural feature open space being considered. 
7.  The amount and quantity of the remaining natural feature open space. 
8.  Proximity of the proposed activity in relation to the natural feature, taking into consideration the degree of slope and the soil type within and adjacent to the natural feature and the setback area, the quantity and speed of surface runoff expected and the nature of the natural feature to be protected. 
9.  Economic value, both public and private, of the proposed activity and economic value, both public and private, if the proposed activity were not permitted. 
e.  Development within designated floodplain areas shall be accomplished in a way that does not alter or obstruct stormwater flow within a designated floodway, maintains the overall stormwater storage capacity of the site and does not increase risks to persons and property. 
f.  Appropriate ground cover, trees and other vegetation shall be planted and maintained on the site to control stormwater runoff and prevent erosion, siltation and dust, to provide privacy between adjacent uses and mitigate impacts from noise and lights, and to enhance the appearance of the site. 
g.  Parking and access facilities shall be landscaped in accordance with the requirements of section 50-840 of this chapter. 
(3)  Traffic access. The site shall be designed and developed to provide safe and efficient access for all forms of travel and to minimize impacts on adjacent public facilities. 
a.  The site shall not overburden adjacent public streets nor cause significant hazards to public safety due to excessive traffic generation or inadequate traffic control. 
b.  Existing and proposed public streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of chapter 40 of the City Code and applicable local standards and specifications. 
c.  Roadway or driveway connections between the site and adjacent public streets shall be spaced sufficiently apart and may be limited in number to minimize congestion and delays in traffic flow along the adjacent public streets and to minimize conflicts with other turning movements on adjacent public streets or private driveways. 
d.  Where practicable, principal access to and from the site shall be provided from major streets; access to local streets shall be designed to avoid excessive traffic volumes and speed through adjacent neighborhoods. 
e.  Appropriate curb radii and lane widths shall be provided and acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required at roadway or driveway openings to protect public safety and minimize congestion and delays along adjacent public streets. 
f.  Separate turn lanes may be required at roadway or driveway openings to reduce on-site stacking and congestion and such lanes shall be clearly marked.

a.  A budget for the public art required by this section shall be established based on the allocation of one percent of the total project cost up to $25,000.00 to be committed to the procurement and display of public art on the site. 
b.  The public art shall be a work of art as defined by section 2-313 of the City Code and shall be approved by the city's arts commission in accordance with the definition of public art and the standards set forth in section 2-315(a)(1) and (7) of the City Code and the city council prior to site plan approval.

Failure to install the public art as required by this subparagraph and in accordance with the approved site plan shall result in denial of a certificate of occupancy. Failure to properly maintain the public art in accordance with the approved site plan is a violation of the zoning code and subject to enforcement pursuant to the provisions of section 50-33. Prior to any enforcement action a violation notice shall be sent to the responsible party. A failure to cure the violation within 30 days shall constitute a violation and each day thereafter that the violation remains uncured shall constitute a separate offense. 
d.  The following projects are exempt from the public art requirements of this section: 
1.  Projects where the application of this requirement would constitute a governmental taking or otherwise be contrary to law, as determined by the zoning administrator, under the particular facts and circumstances of that case as explained in detail by the applicant. The zoning administrator may request additional information from the applicant if insufficient information is provided with the site plan to make a determination. The applicant has all appeal rights as would otherwise be applicable to any determination by the zoning administrator. 
2.  Projects where the total project cost is less than $500,000.00. 
3.  Residential projects containing fewer than four residential units.

Cross reference- Boards and commissions, § 2-241 et seq. 

Sec. 50-61. - Created; membership; meetings. 
    An appeal board, to be known as the East Lansing Zoning Board of Appeals, and to consist of seven members, is hereby created. The members of the appeal board shall be selected by the city council. The legislative body may appoint to the zoning board of appeals not more than two alternative members for the same term as regular members. One regular or alternate member may be a member of the legislative body of the city. Such member shall not serve as the chairperson of the zoning board of appeals. Alternate members may also be members of the planning commission of the city. Members shall be appointed at or before the first council meeting in December of each year to serve from and after January 1 of the following year. All members shall each hold office for a term of three years. Each member shall hold office until his/her successor is selected in the manner above provided. The board shall select its chairperson annually. The planning and zoning official shall serve as secretary of the board. All meetings shall be open to the public. The board shall adopt its own rules of procedure and keep a record of its proceedings, showing the action taken upon each matter considered. Meetings of the board shall be held at such times and places as may be designated by the planning and zoning official. Four members shall constitute a quorum. The planning and zoning official is authorized to call such meetings at any time when matters are pending requiring attention by the board. The planning and zoning official shall call such meetings whenever: 
(1)  A meeting is to be held as previously determined by the board; 
(2)  The planning and zoning official is so instructed by the chairperson; or 
(3)  The planning and zoning official is so instructed in writing by any other members of the board. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.143; Ord. No. 1157, 11-8-2006; Ord. No. 1284, 1-15-2013) 
Sec. 50-62. - Appeals generally. 
    Any decision of the building official or the planning and zoning official which falls within the jurisdiction of the board of appeals may be appealed to said board by any person aggrieved or by any office, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the building official or the planning and zoning official within such time as shall be prescribed by the board by general rule. To effect such appeal, the appellant shall file with the planning and zoning official and with the board of appeals on forms to be furnished by such official, a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The planning and zoning official shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(1)  Hearings. The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal within 60 days from the date of filing thereof, and give due notice thereof, in accordance with the board's bylaws and in accordance with the requirements of section 103 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.3103. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney at a hearing considering his/her request or appeal. 
(2)  Decisions. The board of appeals shall return a decision upon each case within 90 days after a request for appeal has been filed, unless a further time is agreed upon with the parties concerned. The board shall render and file its decision with a written statement of findings of relevant facts and reasons therefore. Any decision of the board shall not become final until the expiration of five days from the date of entry of such order, unless the board shall find the immediate effect of such order is necessary for the preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record. 
(3)  Vote. The concurring vote of four members of the board of appeals shall be necessary to reverse, wholly or partly, or to modify any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building official or the planning and zoning official or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which they are required to pass or to effect any variation in this chapter. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.144; Ord. No. 1157, 11-8-2006) 
Sec. 50-63. - Stay of proceedings pending decision on appeal. 
    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building official certifies to the board of appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with them, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay, would in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted upon due cause shown, by the board of appeals or by the circuit court, upon application and following timely notice thereof to the building official. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.144A) 
Sec. 50-64. - Powers and duties. 
    The board of appeals has the following powers and duties. 
(1)  Review. The board shall review, hear, and decide upon appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building official or the planning and zoning official in the enforcement or application of this chapter. 
(2)  Interpretation. The board shall have the power to review, hear, and decide upon appeals which request the following determinations: 
a.  Requests for the interpretation of the provisions contained within any section of this chapter; 
b.  Classify a use into a comparable use category which is not specifically mentioned by this chapter; 
c.  Determine the off-street parking and loading space requirements of any use which is not specifically mentioned in article VIII of this chapter. 
(3)  Granting of variances. The board shall have the power to authorize upon an appeal specific variances from such dimensional requirements as lot area and width regulations, building height, bulk regulations, yard width, side, and depth regulations, and off-street parking and loading requirements as specified in this chapter, provided, however, that all of the following variance conditions are adhered to and that at least one of the following special findings can be satisfied: 
a.  Variance conditions. All of the following conditions, in the judgment of the board, shall exist before any variance from this chapter shall be granted. Any variance granted shall: 
1.  Not be contrary to the public interest or the general intent and purpose of this chapter. 
2.  Not permit the establishment of a use within a given district which is prohibited therein. 
3.  Not be a variance so commonly recurring as to make reasonably practical the formulation of a general regulation by the city council. 
4.  Not cause substantial adverse effect to properties in the immediate vicinity or in the zoning district where the variance is located. 
5.  Relate only to property that is described in the application for the variance. 
b.  Special findings. If all the foregoing variance conditions can be satisfied, a variance may be granted when the board determines that any one of the following special findings can be clearly demonstrated: 
1.  That there are practical difficulties resulting from the physical characteristics of the property in question which make it unfeasible to carry out the strict letter of this chapter. 
2.  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which apply to the property in question that do not apply to other properties and which have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
3.  That such variation is necessary for the preservation of a substantial property right possessed by other properties within the same zoning district. 
(4)  Conditions of approval of variance. In granting a variance, the board may specify, in writing, such other conditions regarding the location, character, landscaping, or other treatment that will, in the board's judgment, be reasonably necessary to the furtherance of the intent of this chapter and the protection of the public interest. The breach of any such condition shall automatically invalidate the permit granted. 
(5)  Time limit on variances. Each variance granted under the provisions of this chapter shall become null and void after one year from the date of granting unless the construction or occupancy authorized by such variance or permit has commenced and is being pursued diligently to completion. 
(6)  Extensions of variances. The board may grant one extension for a period not to exceed one year for an approved variance when the appellant requests such an extension in writing to the planning and zoning official at least two weeks prior to the expiration date of the original approval and when the board determines that the salient facts of the appeal have not significantly changed. If the board determines that the salient facts of the appeal may have changed significantly, the request shall be treated as a new appeal and processed according to the provisions of section 50-62. 
(7)  Reapplication for denied variances. After a variance has been denied in whole or in part by the board, then no application shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the last denial; provided, however, that a denied variance may be reconsidered by the board when, in the opinion of the planning and zoning official, or the board, newly discovered evidence or changed conditions warrant such reconsideration. 
(8)  Planning coordination. Since the actions and policies of the board of appeals affect, and are affected by, the planning, zoning, and land use policies of the City of East Lansing, close cooperation and coordination with the East Lansing Planning Commission is desirable if the public interest is to be served and substantial justice is to be done. The planning department shall act as an advisory staff to the board and may submit maps, charts, and reports, along with data or recommendations which will aid the board in arriving at a decision. Such reports, data, and recommendations which are submitted will be purely advisory in nature and will be for the purpose of achieving better coordination of the zoning and land use policies within the City of East Lansing.

Secs. 50-65-50-90. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - SPECIAL USE PERMIT 

Sec. 50-91. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is twofold: first, to provide greater flexibility in the placement of certain kinds of uses when, because of their unique characteristics, these uses are such that they can be compatible with and complementary to the uses now permitted in the zone, provided that appropriate safeguards are imposed; second, to provide an adequate review and tighter control of certain uses which have a marked effect on the surrounding area due to their unusual design or operational characteristics or the amount of traffic they generate. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.161; Ord. No. 1061, 2-7-2006) 
Sec. 50-92. - Scope. 
    In order to accomplish such safeguards, in addition to ensuring each use complies with the site plan approval requirements of this chapter, provision is made in this division for a more detailed consideration of the proposed use in relationship to the location, design, size, operation, intensity of use, and potential impacts on traffic generation and safety, public facilities and services and the surrounding neighborhood. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.162; Ord. No. 1061, 2-7-2006) 
Sec. 50-93. - Procedure for application and review. 
    Any application for a special use permit for any use permitted under this division shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the requirements and procedures for site plan approval as specified in section 50-36 of this chapter. A special use permit application may be approved if it meets the required conditions for site plan approval as specified in section 50-36 of this chapter and the applicant makes an affirmative showing and the city finds that the application meets the additional standards of review in section 50-94 of this division. A special use permit may also be approved subject to reasonable conditions or certain modifications necessary to ensure that the use conforms to all applicable requirements. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.163; Ord. No. 1061, 2-7-2006) 
Sec. 50-94. - Standards for review. 
(a)  All uses. Except as may be provided elsewhere in this section or chapter, each special use permit application shall meet each of the following standards: 
(1)  The proposed use shall be consistent with the purpose of the use district in which it is located and the purpose and provisions of this division. 
(2)  The site plan for the property shall be approved in accordance with the provisions of section 50-36 of this chapter. 
(3)  The proposed size, height, architectural character and placement of new or expanded structures on the site shall be reasonably compatible with the existing or anticipated buildings on adjacent properties. 
(4)  Streets and access facilities serving the site shall be able to safely accommodate the expected traffic generated by the proposed use; the use shall not cause excessive traffic congestion or delays, obstruct access to adjacent properties, or imperil the safety of motorists, pedestrians or bicyclists. 
(5)  The proposed use shall not adversely affect the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties by generating excessive noise, vibration, light, glare, odors or any other form of pollution or nuisances. 
(6)  The proposed use shall not materially diminish the economic value of adjacent properties or the city as a whole. 
(7)  The proposed use shall not materially diminish the privacy, safety, security or enjoyment of any residential dwelling or residential neighborhood within the vicinity of the site. 
(8)  The proposed use shall be located with direct access to and frontage on a major street as designated in the major street plan, or within an area designated for adaptive reuse in the city center element of the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Specific uses. In addition to the standards above, to address their unique characteristics, certain uses shall also meet the applicable standards below. 
(1)  Churches. 
a.  Standards set forth in items (3) and (8) of subsection (a) above do not apply to churches. 
b.  The minimum yard requirements of the use district in which the church is to be located shall apply except that in no event shall the yard requirement be less than 0.5 feet of yard to each foot of building height (excluding steeples) as applied to rear yard or side yard depth. 
(2)  Businesses selling alcoholic beverages. The following additional standards shall apply to restaurants and businesses licensed or to be licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages or alcoholic liquor for consumption on or off the premises. 
a.  The establishment shall not be located in such proximity to churches, elementary, or secondary schools, child development centers, or community centers so as to annoy, injure, offend, disrupt, disturb, or interfere with the activities conducted thereon or the persons conducting, attending, or traveling to or from such premises. This restriction may be waived by city council at the request of the church, school district, child development center or community center whose location would otherwise prohibit the proposed use or, if there is an objection to the waiver of this restriction by the church, school or development of community center, city council may waive this restriction only after hearing and good cause shown that the proposed establishment will not be in such proximity so as to annoy, injure, offend, disrupt, disturb, or interfere with the activities of the particular church, school or development of community center. 
b.  The establishment shall not cause or continue an undue concentration of similar uses in the neighborhood such that liquor establishments and trade become a dominant influence or feature of the district or neighborhood. 
(3)  Fraternities and sororities. 
a.  The standard set forth in item (8) of subsection (a) above does not apply to fraternities and sororities. 
b.  In addition to the parking requirements for such uses specified in section 50-812, fraternities and sororities shall provide and maintain a parking access and management arrangement sufficient to serve the parking and access demands associated with chapter meetings, formal and informal social activities, or other on-site events which include the attendance of persons other than those who reside on the property. Such parking and access arrangements may include, but are not limited to, the provision of additional on-site parking, the use of private off-premises parking, the use of public parking in municipal lots or on-street spaces, and the availability of bus or shuttle service or carpooling arrangements. 
(4)  Multiple-family dwellings in business districts. Where multiple-family dwelling units are provided in conjunction with business uses on a property in a business district, the following additional standards shall apply. 
a.  Except where multiple-family dwelling units may be permitted as the sole principal use of a building to provide unique housing opportunities which are not otherwise available in the city center, at a minimum, the first floor of any building shall primarily be used for principal permitted business uses, and the number of multiple-family dwelling units and the permitted occupancy of the units shall be limited to maintain a reasonable balance between the business and residential uses on the property consistent with the purpose of each business district. The provision of first floor retail may be waived by majority vote of the city council in those areas of the B-3 district outside of the area identified in section 50-593(f) of this chapter where warranted by the existing retail opportunities in close proximity to the project. 
b.  The number of multiple-family dwelling units, the permitted occupancy of the units and the height and size of structures containing such units shall be limited to be compatible with adjacent development patterns and any nearby residential districts. 
c.  Reasonable amounts of yard areas and open space shall be provided where necessary to be consistent with surrounding use and development patterns and to provide for the privacy and enjoyment of the residents. 
d.  The design, type and operational characteristics of the business and residential uses on the property shall be compatible with one another. 
e.  The residential units shall be designed and marketed to diversify housing opportunities in the neighborhood and shall not increase existing high concentrations of similar housing units in the neighborhood. Further, in the area west of Collingwood Drive within the district boundaries of the City of East Lansing Downtown Development Authority, in order to achieve diversity in the types of housing offered in the area including an appropriate balance of owner occupied housing, senior housing, low to moderate income housing, mixed-market rental housing and other types of diverse housing in the area, for all development plans that contain housing, an appropriate number of the dwelling units shall be marketed and/or sold as owner occupied housing or housing offered to and restricted to residents 55 and older, restricted to low to moderate income housing or restricted to some other occupancy that would add diversity to the area so that at least 25 percent of the housing is owner occupied, restricted to residents 55 and older, restricted to low to moderate income housing or restricted to some other occupancy that would add diversity to the area. For purposes of this section, "development" shall include more than one structure as long as multiple structures are part of the same site plan approval. The requirement of this section shall not apply to hotels. For any development that is constructed and occupied in excess of the 25 percent requirement of this section, the developer shall be given one credit for each residential unit in excess of the 25 percent. The credits, or any portion thereof, may be used by the developer, or the developer's assignee, as a credit, on a one for one basis, to meet the 25 percent requirement for future development projects in this area. The number of credits obtained for any development shall be calculated by the zoning official and maintained in the city records. Any assignment of credits must be in writing and signed by the developer. The intent to use credits of this nature, the number of credits intended to be used, the location of the development which created the credits, and any documentation showing any assignment of the credits shall be submitted with the site plan or amended site plan. 
(5)  Additional building height. 
a.  Where a special use permit is required to permit building height above the base level permitted in any use district, the compatibility of the building shall be determined in part by the extent to which the use of the building and the building design, its setbacks and its orientation on the site successfully mitigate negative impacts upon neighboring uses, the natural features of the site and public facilities and services. Such buildings may be approved only if they comply with subsection (a) of this section and all of the following additional standards: 
1.  The building shall not be located in such proximity to a single-family or two-family neighborhood so as to cause excessive noise or shadowing impacts, or substantial reductions in personal privacy or property values. The planning and zoning administrator may require the applicant to submit a solar angle diagram and shadow analysis prepared by a registered architect or engineer showing the extent of shadowing caused by the proposed building on adjacent properties and structures. 
2.  The portion of the building extending above the base level permitted in each use district shall be located no closer to the property line of a residentially zoned property than a distance equal to the amount of the height in excess of the base level.

    Gap/critical gap means the median time headway (in seconds) between vehicles in a major traffic stream which will permit side-street vehicles at STOP or YIELD controlled approach to cross through or merge with the major traffic stream under prevailing traffic and roadway conditions. 
    Level of service means a qualitative measure, defined on a scale from A to F, describing operational conditions within a traffic stream; generally described in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, delay, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety. 
    Master plan means the comprehensive plan for the physical development of the City of East Lansing adopted by the Planning Commission pursuant to section 2-342 of the City Code and the Municipal Planning Act, Act 285 of 1931. 
    Peak hour means a one-hour period representing the highest hourly volume of traffic flow on the adjacent street system during the morning (a.m. peak hour), during the afternoon or evening (p.m. peak hour); or representing the hour of highest volume of traffic entering or exiting a site (peak hour of generator). 
    Regional transportation plan means the most recent plan adopted by the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission which identifies transportation deficiencies and guides the expenditure of transportation funds in the region. 
    Study area means the geographic area containing those critical arterial intersections (and connecting roadway segments) which are expected to be affected by the site-traffic generated by a development. 
    Traffic impact study means the analysis of the potential traffic impacts generated by a proposed project. This type of study and level of analysis will vary dependent upon the type and size of the project. The types of traffic impact studies: 
(1)  Traffic impact rezoning study means a traffic study which typically contrasts the traffic impact associated with uses permitted under current zoning with uses permitted under the zoning district requested.

DIVISION 5. - CONDITIONAL REZONING 

Sec. 50-110. - Purpose. 
    It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the best interest of the city, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking a change in zoning boundaries, if certain conditions could be proposed by property owners as part of a request for a rezoning. It is the intent of this section to provide a process consistent with the provisions of section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, 2008 PA 110, as amended (codified at MCL 125.3405 et seq.) by which an owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-111. - Application and offer of conditions. 
(a)  An owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This written offer shall be made prior to the planning commission public hearing. 
(b)  The required application and process for considering a rezoning request with conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning requests made without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the requirements of this division. 
(c)  The owner's offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district. 
(d)  The owner's offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the property for which rezoning is requested. 
(e)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a special land use permit under the terms of section 50-91 of this Code may only be commenced if a special land use permit for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
(f)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a variance under the terms of section 50-61 of this Code may only be commenced if a variance for such use or development is ultimately granted by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
(g)  Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require site plan approval under the terms of section 50-36 of this Code may only be commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
(h)  The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of rezoning consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are voluntarily offered by the owner in writing, signed, dated, and made part of the record of proceeding. An owner may withdraw all or part of its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the city council provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the planning commission's public hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be referred to the planning commission for a new public hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation. 
(i)  The offer shall be supplemented with sufficient graphic representation to depict written conditions. 
(j)  The owner shall describe how the proposed use fits the comprehensive plan and zoning district involved. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-112. - Planning commission review. 
    The planning commission, after public hearing and consideration of the factors for rezoning, set forth in section 50-31(b) of this Code may recommend approval, or denial of the rezoning. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-113. - City council review. 
    After receipt of the planning commission's recommendation, the city council shall deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning request. The city council's deliberations shall include, but not be limited to, a consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in section 50-31(b) of this Code. Should the city council consider owner amendments, withdrawing all or part of its offer of conditions, to the proposed conditional rezoning advisable and if such contemplated amendments to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered by the owner, then the city council shall, in accordance with section 308(1) of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.3308, refer such amendments to the planning commission for review and recommendation thereon within a time specified by the city council and proceed thereafter in accordance with said statute to deny or approve the conditional rezoning. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-114. - Approval. 
(a)  If the city council finds the rezoning request and offer of conditions acceptable, the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a formal written conditional rezoning agreement acceptable to the owner and conforming in form to the provisions of this section. The conditional rezoning agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by the city council to accomplish the requested rezoning. 
(b)  The conditional rezoning agreement shall: 
(1)  Be in a form recordable with the register of deeds of the county in which the subject land is located or, in the alternative, be accompanied by a recordable affidavit or memorandum prepared and signed by the owner giving notice of the conditional rezoning agreement in a manner acceptable to the city council. 
(2)  Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains. 
(3)  Contain a statement acknowledging that the conditional rezoning agreement runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land. 
(4)  Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or other documents submitted or approved by the owner that are necessary to illustrate the implementation of the conditional rezoning agreement. If any such documents are incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify where the document may be examined. 
(5)  Contain a statement acknowledging that the conditional rezoning agreement or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof may be recorded by the city with the register of deeds of the county in which the land referenced in the conditional rezoning agreement is located. 
(6)  Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the subject land preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained within the conditional rezoning agreement. 
(7)  Other information as requested by the city necessary to define the conditional rezoning agreement. 
(c)  Upon the rezoning taking effect, the zoning map shall be amended to reflect the new zoning classification along with a designation that the land was rezoned with a conditional rezoning agreement. The city clerk shall maintain a listing of all lands rezoned with a conditional rezoning agreement. 
(d)  The approved conditional rezoning agreement or an affidavit or memorandum giving notice thereof shall be filed by the city with the register of deeds of the county in which the land is located. 
(e)  Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned shall conform thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use and development within the new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive provisions contained in the conditional rezoning agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-115. - Compliance with conditions. 
(a)  Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon land that has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and maintain the development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the conditional rezoning agreement. Any failure to comply with a condition contained within the conditional rezoning agreement shall constitute a violation of this zoning code and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided by law. 
(b)  No permit or approval shall be granted under this division for any use or development that is contrary to an applicable conditional rezoning agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-116. - Time period for establishing development or use. 
    Unless another time period is specified in the ordinance conditionally rezoning the subject land, the approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required permits must be commenced upon the land within 18 months after the conditional rezoning took effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time limitation may upon written request be extended by the city council if (1) it is demonstrated to the city's reasonable satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion and (2) the city council finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that would render the current zoning with a conditional rezoning agreement is compatible with other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise inconsistent with sound zoning policy. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-117. - Reversion of zoning. 
    If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land do not occur within the time frame specified under section 50-116, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in MCL 125.3405(2). The reversion process shall be initiated by the planning and zoning official, at the time which the conditional rezoning agreement is no longer valid, requesting that the planning commission proceed with consideration of rezoning of the land to its former zoning classification. The procedure for considering and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the same as applies to all other rezoning requests. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-118. - Subsequent rezoning of land. 
    When land that is rezoned with a conditional rezoning agreement is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning classification or to the same zoning classification but with a different or no conditional rezoning agreement, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to section 50-117 above or otherwise, the conditional rezoning agreement imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owner's written request, the city clerk shall record with the register of deeds of the county in which the land is located a notice that the conditional rezoning agreement is no longer in effect.

(b)  The conditional rezoning agreement may be amended thereafter in the same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-120. - City right to rezone. 
    Nothing in the conditional rezoning agreement nor in the provisions of this section shall be deemed to prohibit the city from rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a conditional rezoning agreement to another zoning classification; provided, however, that no such rezoning shall be effective prior to the expiration of the time period for commencement of the development or land use as specified under section 50-116. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this division and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.3308. 
(Ord. No. 1252, 3-20-2012) 
Sec. 50-121. - Failure to offer conditions.

Sec. 50-122. - Notice of adoption. 
    A notice of the conditional rezoning ordinance adoption shall include a summary of conditions of approval and be published and mailed in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 50-31(c).

DIVISION 7. - CLUSTERED DEVELOPMENT PLAN 

Sec. 50-321. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  These provisions are intended to permit and regulate large scale planned residential communities using innovative clustered designs as an alternative to traditional subdivision development in the R-1 and R-2 single-family residential districts. Through this overlay zoning process, all forms of housing development are permitted, singularly or in combination, but at an overall site density commensurate with the limits of the underlying single-family zoning district. This process also permits limited office uses, golf courses and country clubs and a variety of other open space and recreational elements to complement the development and benefit the residents of the planned community. This process encourages innovative, comprehensive and integrated design to ensure that the different uses present are compatible and complementary with each other and with their neighbors. It also limits total site development to preserve substantial areas of open space and protect desirable natural features of the site. 
(b)  It is also the purpose of the district to achieve the following objectives: 
(1)  To have land developed in a planned and orderly manner, at one time or in phases, in accordance with an overall site plan.

ARTICLE V. - MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 50-361. - Purpose and scope. 
(a)  The purposes of this division are to require the development of dwelling units in multiple-family residential districts that are visitable, usable, and safe for occupancy by persons with disabilities and to accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and functional abilities while not significantly impacting housing costs and affordability. 
(b)  This division shall apply to the new construction of all multifamily residential dwellings in all residential development projects in the city's multiple family residential districts constructed under the Michigan Building Code and to townhouse and duplex development projects with greater than ten dwelling units constructed under the Michigan Residential Code, in the aggregate of all phases. 
(Ord. No. 1385, 11-9-2016) 
Sec. 50-362. - Findings at time of adoption. 
(a)  Individuals with mobility difficulties may require special accommodations to their homes to allow for continued independent living. This chapter is reasonably necessary to serve this population as well as those anticipating a disability by enhancing opportunities for the full life cycle use of housing without regard to the physical abilities or disabilities of a home's occupants or guests. 
(b)  There has been a significant increase, locally, of persons in need of accommodations in their housing related to Michigan State University. Michigan State University reports 1,592 students (up four percent over last year) with permanent disabilities that received services from Michigan State University's Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD) with 111 additional receiving services for temporary conditions. Fifty students reported an open case with Michigan Rehabilitation Services while five reported working with the Bureau of Services for Blind Persons. 
(c)  The RCPD staff assessed and registered 411 new students with permanent disabilities via the Academic Orientation Program and ongoing self-identification activities which evidences a trend for the increased need of accommodations for housing. The disability counts by major characteristic (permanent disabilities only) and the relationship to the previous year's count were reported to be as follows: 
(1)  Deaf/hard of hearing-57 (up 14% from last year) 
(2)  Blindness/visual impairment-45 (down 2% from last year) 
(3)  Mobility-142 (up 14%) 
(4)  Brain injury-70 (up 4%) 
(5)  Learning disability-783 (up 2%) 
(6)  Psychiatric-570 (up 16%) 
(7)  Chronic health-349 (up 7%) 
(8)  Autism spectrum-57 (up 14%) 
(9)  Other-44 (up 25%) 
(10)  Multiple-426 (up 12%) 
(d)  Michigan State University reported 163 employees (up 19 percent over last year) with active permanent disabilities were current with the RCPD; 40 were newly registered this year with a net population increase of 26 given retirements and other transitions which is further evidence of a trend for the increased need in housing accommodations. Disability counts by major characteristic (permanent disabilities only) and the relationship to the previous year's count were reported to be as follows: 
(1)  Deaf/hard of hearing-23 (up 44% over last year) 
(2)  Blindness/visual impairment-16 (down 6%) 
(3)  Mobility-67 (up 14%) 
(4)  Brain injury-14 (up 56%) 
(5)  Learning disability-11 (no change) 
(6)  Psychiatric-24 (up 20%) 
(7)  Chronic health-56 (up 22%) 
(8)  Autism spectrum-1 (no change) 
(9)  Other-13 (up 100%) 
(10)  Multiple-31 (up 29%) 
(e)  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 14.9 percent of U.S. residents were 65 and older in 2015, while 3.8 percent were 80 and older. By 2050 these percentages are projected to increase to approximately 22 percent and eight percent respectively. In that same period overall population is projected to increase 24 percent resulting in a near doubling of the 65 and older population. These demographic trends will increase the demand for senior housing with accommodations.

DIVISION 2. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, RM-8 

Sec. 50-381. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  The RM-8 residential district is a broad and flexible zoning classification which permits a variety of housing at different densities and limited office use. It establishes a base level of development at a relatively low density and other requirements which, at a minimum, will preserve the attractiveness, desirability, and privacy of residential neighborhoods. It encourages the planning and development of larger parcels by permitting different types of housing at different densities within the site and limited amounts of office use to buffer residential uses from major streets. It also provides density bonuses, reductions in lot sizes and setbacks and other flexibility in the base standards, when the objectives below and certain other specified standards are met, to encourage innovative design. The ultimate goal of the district is to increase the amount and variety of housing opportunities in the city while protecting the interests of residents and the overall attractiveness of the city. 
(b)  It is also the purpose of the district to achieve the following objectives: 
(1)  To have land developed in a planned and orderly manner by requiring a minimum site size and by providing density bonuses as an incentive to accumulate larger parcels, at one time or in phases, in accordance with an overall site plan. 
(2)  To have a variety of housing opportunities available within the city by encouraging a range of different housing types and innovative designs. 
(3)  To encourage more affordable housing by permitting clustered and innovative site designs and by providing for higher densities and limited office use within the development. 
(4)  To control congestion and safety along public streets and to provide safe and convenient access by limiting access to major streets, by requiring improved facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, and motor vehicles, and by requiring linkages to neighboring developments and public facilities. 
(5)  To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion, and nuisance impacts by regulating the size and placement of buildings and parking facilities and by requiring buffers consisting of setbacks and landscape screens between uses and along streets. 
(6)  To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a desirable living environment for residents by preserving natural features, particularly stands of mature trees, wetlands and floodplains, and by requiring open space and recreational facilities.

Sec. 50-383. - Required conditions. 
    The following standards must be complied with by a development within the RM-8 residential district. 
(1)  Minimum site area. The site must have a contiguous area of at least five acres, exclusive of existing and intended rights-of-way along abutting public streets. The site may consist of two or more contiguous parcels of land which shall be developed by a single owner or a group of owners acting jointly in accordance with an approved site plan which encompasses the entire site. 
(2)  Base residential density. The base number of residential units permitted on a site shall be determined by dividing the total site area by the minimum site area per unit standards from the following schedule: 
Type of Unit Minimum Site Area Efficiency or 1 bedroom 4,000 sq. ft. per unit 2 bedroom 5,500 sq. ft. per unit 3 bedroom or larger 7,000 sq. ft. per unit Extended care, group housing 2,000 sq. ft. per person, based on the maximum permitted residential occupancy  
For the purposes of this calculation, total site area shall not include any portion of the site which is used for offices or a golf course or country club, including their related parking areas, accessory uses and required yard areas. Where the type of unit to be built is not known or stipulated at the time of site plan review, as may be the case with subdivided building lots, each unknown unit shall be assumed to be a three-bedroom unit in determining the number of units permitted. 
(3)  Density bonuses for larger sites. Density bonuses may be given for sites of five acres or more where the proposed development would be consistent with the purpose of this district and substantially contribute to achieving one or more of its objectives as stated in section 50-381. If approved, the bonuses shall be in the form of percentage reductions in the minimum site area required for each unit stated in subsection (2) of this section, as shown in the following schedule: 
Number of Acres Reduction in Minimum Site Area Per Unit Fewer than 10 10% 10 but fewer than 20 20% 20 but fewer than 30 30% 30 but fewer than 40 40% 40 or more 50%  
If bonuses are approved, the total number of units permitted shall be determined by dividing the total site area, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, by the reduced site area per unit standard. 
(4)  Phased development; density of individual elements. A site within this district may be planned and developed by a single owner or developer, or it may be developed in phases by two or more owners or developers in accordance with an overall site plan for the entire site. Individual elements of the overall site plan may be designed and developed at different densities as long as the total number of dwelling units on the entire site complies with the overall density limit established in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. 
(5)  Maximum office use. The gross floor area devoted to office use, exclusive of accessory office use as permitted in section 50-382(3)d, shall not exceed a figure equal to ten percent of the gross floor area of all principal buildings on the site. 
(6)  Minimum residential lot area. Where part or all of the site is subdivided into separate building lots for single-family detached units or for similar units which abut or are attached with party walls, such as duplexes and townhouses, minimum lot areas shall be provided according to the following schedule. 
Minimum Lot Area For a detached unit 3,400 sq. ft. For each attached unit 2,000 sq. ft.  
(7)  Maximum building height. The maximum permitted height of buildings shall be determined according to the following schedule: 
a.  Principal residential buildings. 
Site Size Maximum Height Fewer than 10 acres 3 stories, or 40 feet 10 but fewer than 20 acres 4 stories, or 50 feet, subject to an approved special use permit as provided by article II, division 3 of this chapter 20 or more acres 6 stories, or 70 feet, subject to an approved special use permit as provided by article II, division 3 of this chapter  
b.  Office buildings. 
Site Size Maximum Height Fewer than 20 acres 1 story, or 24 feet 20 or more acres 2 stories, or 36 feet  
c.  Accessory buildings. 
Site Size Maximum Height Fewer than 10 acres 1 story, or 15 feet 10 or more acres 2 stories, or 25 feet Golf course clubhouse 2 stories, or 36 feet  
(8)  Maximum building and ground coverage. 
a.  The maximum building and ground coverage ratios for the entire site shall be 25 percent and 40 percent, respectively. These ratios may be increased to 30 percent and 45 percent where the site is 20 acres or larger in size or where no buildings are more than 21/2 stories in height. For the purpose of this district, spaces occupied by recreational facilities provided for the use of residents and their guests, up to a total of five percent of the site, shall not be counted as coverage. Such facilities may include freestanding recreational structures, such as pools and clubhouses, and separate improved recreational surfaces, such as basketball and shuffleboard courts. 
b.  For subdivided building lots within the development, the maximum building and ground coverage ratios shall be 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively. If the amount of building and ground coverage on subdivided lots is not known nor otherwise stipulated at the time of site plan review, the coverage ratios for the entire site shall be calculated by assuming that each lot is developed to the maximum permissible standards. 
(9)  General setback requirements. The basic minimum setback requirements for principal and accessory buildings and parking spaces and parking lots are as follows: 
Buildings Parking a. From major streets 50' 50' b. From other public streets 25' 25' c. From private roads 20'  0' d. From exterior site boundaries where the abutting property is within the R-1, R-2, or R-3 residential districts 2×H+LI 25' e. From other exterior site boundaries 25'+HI+LI 25' H = Building height. HI = Height increment = 50% of the building height over 25 ft. LI = Length increment = 10% of the building length over 50 ft.  
(10)  Setback reductions. 
a.  The basic setback standards specified in subsections (9)a, b, d, and e of this section may be reduced by up to 50 percent but in no case to less than 20 feet, where unique site characteristics, compatible design and scale, or landscaping or design features in excess of the requirements in subsection (15) of this section will achieve the objectives in section 50-381 and accomplish the same purposes for which the setbacks are intended. These purposes are: 
1.  Ensuring reasonable privacy for residents and neighbors of the development; 
2.  Protecting residents and neighbors from noise, shadowing, and other nuisance impacts; 
3.  Maintaining adequate visibility for safety along streets and sidewalks; and 
4.  Maintaining an attractive appearance of the development from abutting properties and public streets. 
Such characteristics or features may include, but would not be limited to: significant slopes which effectively reduce the apparent size of buildings and screen parking areas from view; dense buffers of mature trees and other plant materials along exterior property lines; significant landscape treatments which include earth berms, fences, or walls at least three feet in height in addition to a variety of plant materials; buildings which are designed and located to maximize privacy and minimize noise, shadowing, and other impacts between adjacent properties; and buildings which are designed at a scale which is comparable to and compatible with surrounding uses. 
b.  The setback requirements for parking facilities located along an exterior property line may be waived, in whole or in part, where the owners of two adjacent properties agree in writing to develop shared access and parking facilities to serve both properties. If site plans for both properties are not submitted simultaneously, each site plan must clearly show the parking and access facilities to be shared, along with required details and specifications. The shared facilities may be constructed in phases, provided that, each phase is readily accessible and is constructed and maintained according to required specifications. 
(11)  Setback requirements for interior lots. Buildings and parking spaces on subdivided lots within the development shall meet the standards in subsection (9) of this section. There shall be no other setback requirements from the lot lines on such lots. 
(12)  Minimum distance between buildings. Two buildings shall be located no closer to one another than a distance equal to the height of the taller one, except that this distance may be reduced by up to 50 percent if the buildings are designed and located to maintain privacy between neighbors and to minimize noise, shadowing, and other nuisance and appearance impacts on residents. In no case shall two detached buildings be located closer than ten feet apart. 
(13)  Minimum horizontal distance between building wings. The angle between two wings of one building shall not be less than 90 degrees. In instances where two wings of the same building face each other, such as in a U-shaped building, the wings must be separated according to the standards in subsection (12) of this section. 
(14)  Required parking. 
a.  Parking facilities shall be provided in accordance with article VIII of this chapter, except that the required number of spaces for an office use which is developed in conjunction with a residential development, as provided in section 50-382(2), may be waived in whole or in part. The waiver may be granted when it is determined that there would be sufficient numbers of conveniently located spaces available for customers and employees of the office use during its hours of operation. Restricted hours of operation may be stated as a condition of the special use permit for the office use to ensure that sufficient parking will be available to residents of the development. 
b.  Parking facilities may be allowed within or under any building; otherwise, parking spaces not on a driveway shall be located no closer than ten feet to any building. 
(15)  Open space and recreation. 
a.  A minimum of 20 percent of the total site, exclusive of required setbacks, shall be open space held for the use and enjoyment of residents of the development. Private yards on subdivided lots, preserved woodlots and wetlands, playgrounds, and the space occupied by freestanding recreational facilities and buildings may be counted as open space. Where land is to be dedicated as open space within subdivisions or condominium developments, appropriate easements or land dedication documents shall accompany the application for approval. 
b.  A variety of playground equipment or other improved recreational areas or facilities shall be provided in accordance with the anticipated interests of the expected occupants of the development. 
(16)  Perimeter landscaping. Trees of a type and size specified in section 48-32 of the City Code shall be planted no more than 60 feet apart within the right-of-way along all public streets abutting or within the development. A variety of trees and shrubbery shall be planted between buildings, parking areas, or other improved facilities and all exterior boundaries of the development. These requirements may be modified or waived where there are existing trees or shrubbery to be retained. 
(Code 1994, ch. 55, § 5.41-4; Ord. No. 998, 6-25-2002; Ord. No. 1087, pt. III, 12-21-2004)

b.  The placement, bulk, and design of structures and uses shall be arranged to minimize contrasts in scale between abutting uses and exposure to nuisance factors, such as noise and glare, and to maximize privacy for residents and neighbors. 
c.  Each development shall contain a reasonable mixture of two or more of the principal uses as permitted in section 50-382(1), unless the development is so small that a mixture would be impractical or if the type of dwelling unit proposed would complement and expand the range of existing housing opportunities available in the surrounding neighborhood. 
d.  The type and mixture of principal uses present shall be appropriate for the size, character and location of the site, compatible with adjacent uses and consistent with the objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Office use. 
a.  The inclusion of an office use in a residential development shall be permitted only if the benefits of the office use to residents, neighbors, and the city at large outweigh any potential interference or disruption because of noise, traffic, physical activity, or other attributes of the office use. 
b.  The nature, placement, and design of office use on the site shall be arranged to minimize traffic and nuisance impacts on residents and neighbors of the development. 
c.  Offices may be located within structures used predominantly for residential purposes or in separate structures. If a separate structure is provided for office use, it must be architecturally consistent with other structures on the site and with the overall residential image of the property. 
(3)  Golf courses and country clubs. 
a.  Principal vehicular access to the facility shall be arranged to minimize adverse impacts on surrounding residential dwellings and pedestrian and bicycle safety. 
b.  Buildings and parking areas shall be sufficiently set back and screened to maintain privacy for surrounding residential dwellings. 
c.  Structures provided in conjunction with the course must be architecturally compatible with other structures on the site and with the overall design of the development. 
d.  Individual golf holes and driving ranges shall be placed and oriented to minimize risks of damage to surrounding residential dwellings. 
(4)  Public facilities and services.

DIVISION 4. - MEDIUM DENSITY MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, RM-22 

Sec. 50-421. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this district is to provide for residential development at a medium population density. The provisions of this district are intended to recognize that a certain amount of flexibility in multiple-family living is desirable and the district is designed to complement the requirements of the low and high density multiple-family districts. The provisions of this district are intended to provide for sites in logical locations after consideration of such factors as the following: the capacity and character of adjoining streets; the nature of surrounding uses; the nearness to large concentrations of employment such as the university; or where a substantial amount of primarily vacant land exists or where smaller individual parcels of land can be feasibly assembled to form a single, larger parcel suitable for multiple-family apartments. It is intended that this district accommodate a compatible development of residential use at a higher density than single-family, but no lower standards of quality. Attractiveness, order, and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air, and usable open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship to each permitted use in this district.

The B-1 district also permits certain other uses which are comparable to and compatible with an office environment in design and function, including personal service businesses. However, the B-1 district is intended to prohibit commercial establishments of a general retail nature which require constant visits by the general public. The B-1 district also permits certain other uses which may be necessary in support of office use or mixed use structures with residential dwellings which may be compatible with such an environment, subject to additional regulation to ensure such uses do not cause undesirable or excessive amounts of traffic, congestion or other adverse impacts.

DIVISION 4. - CITY CENTER COMMERCIAL DISTRICT, B-3[9] 

Footnotes:

Cross reference- Businesses, ch. 8. 

Sec. 50-591. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this district is to provide for a wide range of commercial and high density residential land uses designed to serve the residents and shoppers of the East Lansing City Center. Because of its proximity to the Michigan State University campus and nearby residential neighborhoods, a major characteristic of the City Center is its intense core of pedestrian activity. This activity helps to create a unique social environment where people can gather and enjoy the festive atmosphere of a university downtown, attractive landscaping and greenery, and the diversity of retail shops. 
(b)  The provisions of this district are intended to encourage the planned development of pedestrian amenities and public and private open space, and closely regulate the need for direct automobile access to each establishment. Also important in the future development of the City Center is the concept of mixed-use development promoted by this district and the East Lansing Comprehensive Plan. Mixed-use development for purposes of this district is defined as the combination of commercial and residential land uses within the same building. Since the City Center contains only limited geographic area for expansion, intensifying development through a mixture of uses within the same building is of major importance to the city's efforts to expand the tax base and broaden the housing and shopping opportunities available in the City Center.

Any building existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be allowed to expand without regard to this standard. Small, separately held lots of less than 10,000 square feet that abut a residential district may also be exempted from this requirement if the planning commission determines that the development potential of the lot is limited because of its size, configuration or location and that the proposed design and use of the lot would provide a desirable buffer between adjacent uses. 
(f)  The building height shall be four stories or 64 feet if they do not have a residential component and six stories or 96 feet if they have a residential component; except buildings may be up to eight stories or 112 feet in height or below the required height, subject to an approved special use permit as provided by article II, division 3, of this chapter; and except further, that within that portion of the area zoned in this district bounded by Grand River Avenue, Bailey Street, Albert Avenue, Grove Street, Linden Street, Abbot Road, City Parking Lot 15, the north-south alley west of Abbot Road and 200 West Grand River Avenue (The Peoples Church), the city council may, upon an affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council, permit an increase in stories or a maximum building height of up to 140 feet for a building deemed by the city council to be of significant public benefit subject to an approved special use permit as provided in article II, division 3 of this chapter. Further, additional stories may be added to existing one and two story buildings that total less than four stories or 64 feet in height if the existing building remains substantially the same. 
(g)  Maximum building and ground coverage. The percentage of total site area allowed to be covered shall be determined according to the following schedule: 
_____ 
Base Ratio Base Allotment Maximum Permitted Building coverage 80% + (*) = 100% Ground coverage 85% + (*) = 100%  
*Bonus allotments of building and ground coverage may be granted, provided that, the proposed use, its site or its relationship to adjacent properties incorporates certain architectural or site design features which allow for public or private open space, free movement of pedestrian traffic, abundant light and air, and other related elements. Qualifying features may include, but are not limited to, atriums, arcades, enclosed walkways, rooftop gardens, landscaped areas, plazas, and outdoor dining areas. 
_____

(j)  On-premises parking. Consistent with the purposes of this district and the city's policies to optimize use of its consolidated parking facilities in the City Center commercial district, on-premises parking facilities intended as accessory uses to serve one or more uses on the same lot shall be prohibited, except where: 
(1)  The applicant has demonstrated that the parking is necessary for the residents or customers of the proposed use and the municipal parking facility cannot accommodate the use; or 
(2)  The applicant has demonstrated that the parking is necessary for increased accessibility for handicapped persons. 
If it is demonstrated that on-premises parking is necessary, the planning commission may stipulate conditions on the arrangement and operation of such parking to ensure that it is used for the purposes for which it is intended and approved or to ensure that it does not cause disruption of pedestrian or vehicular circulation. 
(k)  Off-premises parking. To ensure accessible parking for all uses in the district, the standards of subsection 50-814(d) must be met. 
(l)  Applications for a building and/or occupancy permit to construct or expand a building or to convert or extend the use of a building which would result in an increased parking demand, as determined from the standards in section 50-812, shall first be submitted to the planning and zoning official for review. 
(1)  To determine the number of parking spaces available, the planning and zoning official shall yearly prepare a report on the utilization of parking spaces within the district which specifies the number of spaces available by location, price, and tenure rates, and time of day. The report shall be presented to and approved by city council. The planning and zoning official shall also keep a record of all new, expanded, and converted uses which generate increased parking demands. The planning and zoning official shall not approve an application when the total amount of additional parking demands approved under subsection (l)(2) and subsection (l)(3) of this section within a one-year period would exceed a figure equal to 75 percent of the total number of parking spaces determined to be available in the annual report. 
(2)  If the application would result in an increase of ten or fewer spaces for a use within a two-year period, the planning and zoning official shall approve it, if there are adequate and appropriate parking spaces available to serve the use, as defined by the following standards: 
a.  The price and tenure rates for available parking spaces must be consistent with the expected parking habits of customers, employees, and tenants of the proposed use. 
b.  The parking spaces must be available at all times consistent with anticipated peak parking demands of the proposed use. 
c.  The parking spaces must meet the standards of subsection 50-814(d). 
(3)  If the application would result in an increase of more than ten spaces within a two-year period or would exceed the limit of 75 percent of available spaces described above, the applicant shall submit a parking plan to the planning commission for review at a public hearing. The parking plan shall indicate where customers, employees, and tenants of the proposed use will be expected to park; the estimated number of employees and tenants; the anticipated time(s) of peak customer loads; the location and arrangement of all existing or proposed on-site parking spaces as may be permitted under subsection (j) of this section; evidence of any arrangement(s) made by the applicant to use other off-premises parking spaces; and evidence of any proposed action(s) by the applicant to control or limit the parking demand generated by the proposed use. The planning commission shall approve the parking plan if it determines that the proposed use would not adversely affect surrounding properties and public facilities and that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  Because of the particular characteristics of the proposed use, it would not be expected to generate a significant increase in parking demand. 
b.  Existing or proposed on-site spaces or other private off-street parking facilities, as may be permitted under subsection (j) of this section, would meet the parking needs of the proposed use. 
c.  The parking demand would be adequately accommodated within the municipal parking system due to the availability of spaces appropriate to serve the proposed use, as defined in the standards in subsection (l)(2) of this section.

Sec. 50-671. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this district is to permit a specialized range of uses which will strengthen the local economy by expanding job opportunities and diversifying the city's tax base in a manner which is consistent with the overall character of the city and compatible with surrounding uses and facilities. The district is intended to accommodate larger office buildings and complexes, scientific and applied research facilities, and uses dedicated to the development and application of innovative technology, production techniques and products, as well as commercial recreational facilities. The nature, scale, and function of such uses will be limited and regulated to ensure that they pose no significant or unusual risk to the public health, safety, and welfare, generate a minimum of noise, heat, glare, odor, dust, vibration, heavy truck traffic or other nuisances; emit no harmful radiation or pollution of the air, water, or ground; and pose a minimum of traffic, fire, or other safety hazards. The location of such uses will be limited to areas which are highly visible and accessible from major transportation facilities. The design and development of land and facilities in this district will be regulated to create a low density, well planned, park-like environment with architecturally attractive buildings and structures, large, well landscaped yard areas and vistas, and screened parking, access, and storage facilities. To achieve these objectives, the district requires the integrated planning of large tracts of land while permitting phased development to minimize disruptions and instability for existing residents.

DIVISION 5. - RESIDENTIAL RENTAL RESTRICTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 50-772. - Residential rental restriction overlay districts R-O-1, R-O-2 and R-O-3. 
    Residential rental restriction overlay districts R-O-1, R-O-2 and R-O-3 are hereby established. 
(Ord. No. 1035C, 4-7-2004) 
Sec. 50-773. - Purpose and objectives. 
    The residential rental restriction overlay districts R-O-1, R-O-2 and R-O-3 are zoning classifications which permit owners of property within R-1, R-2 and RM-8 residential zoning districts to petition city council to establish an overlay district, and district use regulations in their residential neighborhood, which would prohibit or restrict the rental uses of one-family dwellings within the neighborhood. These districts establish three levels of restrictions which operate to preserve the attractiveness, desirability, and privacy of residential neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental properties and thereby preclude the deleterious effects rental properties can have on a neighborhood with regard to property deterioration, increased density, congestion, noise and traffic levels and reduction of property values. The goal of the overlay district is to allow owners of property within residential neighborhoods to control the types of rental properties, if any, that are permitted in one-family dwellings within their neighborhood. It is also the purpose of the districts to achieve the following objectives: 
(1)  To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion, and nuisance impacts by regulating the types of rental properties; 
(2)  To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a desirable living environment for residents by preserving the owner occupied character of the neighborhood; 
(3)  To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. 1035C, 4-7-2004) 
Sec. 50-774. - Uses permitted. 
    Uses permitted in the R-O-1, R-O-2, and R-O-3 residential rental restriction overlay district are as follows: 
(1)  In the R-O-1 residential rental restriction overlay district, permitted uses are all uses in the underlying zoning district except the use or occupancy of a one-family dwelling unit so as to require a rental housing license pursuant to section 6-175 (Article 10) of the Code of the City of East Lansing. 
(2)  In the R-O-2 residential rental restriction overlay district, permitted uses are all uses in the underlying zoning district except the use or occupancy of a one-family dwelling unit so as to require a rental housing license pursuant to section 6-175 (Article 10) of the Code of the City of East Lansing unless the use or occupancy is in accordance with a Class I rental license and the owner of the property owned it on the date the overlay district ordinance was approved by city council. 
(3)  In the R-O-3 residential rental restriction overlay district, permitted uses are all uses in the underlying zoning district except the use or occupancy of a one-family dwelling unit so as to require a rental housing license pursuant to section 6-175 (Article 10) of the Code of the City of East Lansing unless the use or occupancy is in accordance with a Class I rental license. 
(Ord. No. 1035C, 4-7-2004) 
Sec. 50-775. - Procedures. 
    The following procedures must be complied with in order to establish a residential overlay district: 
(1)  A petition requesting an overlay district must be submitted to the city clerk on forms provided by the city clerk. The petition requirements are as follows: 
a.  At least two days prior to circulating a petition, the circulator(s) of the petition must distribute a rental restriction overlay district information sheet, approved and created by the city, to each property owner of record within the area to be petitioned, a copy of which shall be available in the city clerk's office for review. 
b.  The petition must identify the specific overlay district that is sought by specifying either an R-O-1, R-O-2 or R-O-3 overlay district. 
c.  Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns property within the proposed district and be signed by the circulator. 
d.  The petition must contain the signature and address of two-thirds of the parcel owners within the proposed boundary of the overlay district, exclusive of public property. Jointly owned parcels will be considered owned by a single person for purpose of petitioning and any co-owner may sign a petition for such parcel. Only one owner of each parcel will count towards the two-thirds requirement. If a person owns more than one parcel of property within the proposed district, they may sign the petition for each parcel they own. 
e.  Each person signing the petition must also enter, on the petition, adjacent to their signature, the date that the person signed the petition. 
f.  The petition must accurately advise the signer of what restrictions would be imposed on the property if the overlay district is established. The circulator(s) of the petitions shall verify on the petition that the required information sheet was distributed to each property of record at least two days prior to circulation of the petition and those signing the petition must acknowledge that they received the required information sheet at least two days prior to signing the petition by marking the appropriate box next to their signature. 
g.  The proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be described in the petition and the boundaries must, if practicable, consist of streets, alleys, platted subdivision boundaries or existing zoning district lines which totally enclose the proposed district. 
h.  There must be at least 50 separate lots or parcels within the proposed district as described in the petition or the proposed district must constitute a discrete neighborhood geographic area. 
i.  The proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be entirely within R-1, R-2, or RM-8 zoning districts and the parcels within the proposed district must be contiguous. 
j.  The proposed boundaries may not overlap a boundary of existing overlay districts or the boundary of an overlay district that is already the subject of an introduced ordinance pursuant to this section. 
k.  When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six months prior to the time the petition is filed with the city clerk shall be counted in determining the validity of the petition. 
(2)  Upon presentation to the city clerk for review, the clerk shall verify the signatures on the petitions. If insufficient signatures are presented, the clerk shall return the petitions to the person filing the petitions and identify the valid and invalid signatures. If sufficient valid signatures are presented, the clerk shall refer the petitions to the zoning department which shall then, within 30 days, determine whether the petitions are in conformity with the remaining conditions of this section. 
a.  If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the requirements of this section, the zoning administrator shall draft an appropriate ordinance and forward it to city council for introduction in accordance with the petition procedures set forth in section 50-31. All procedures set forth in section 50-31 for zoning changes by petition shall thereafter be followed. 
b.  If the petition is not in conformity with the requirements of this section, the zoning administrator shall reject the petition and return it to the clerk with a written explanation as to why the petition does not meet the requirements of this section. The clerk shall then forward the petitions, and the explanation, to the person who filed the petitions. 
c.  If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with the boundary requirements, it may be resubmitted with the proper boundary lines if it is accompanied by certification that a copy of the petition and written notice was mailed to each property affected by the change, notifying them that their property was either added to or deleted from the petition and if by the correction of the boundary line the petition still meets all other requirements of the code. 
d.  If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid signatures, it may be resubmitted with the additional signatures necessary to have it comply as long as the other signatures remain valid. 
e.  If an ordinance is forwarded to city council pursuant to this section, after consideration of the petition and the recommendations of the zoning administrator, if any, the city council may make additions or changes in the boundaries of the proposed overlay district to prevent spot zoning, to include or exclude areas that logically should have been included or excluded in the petition, to make the boundaries of the proposed overlay district abut boundary lines of other zoning districts and overlay districts, and to adopt an alternate ordinance in conformity with the suggested changes whether or not the two-thirds majority requirement of property owners would still be met with the proposed changes. 
f.  If the city council, in adopting an ordinance for an overlay district, applies the ordinance to fewer parcels of property than the petition sought, the owners of at least two-thirds of the parcels remaining in the overlay district must have signed the original petition. 
(3)  Subsequent to the introduction of an ordinance proposing to establish an overlay district, the circulator(s) of the petition for the overlay district or a majority of those persons who signed the petition for an overlay district may file a written request with the city council to table consideration or further proceedings toward the adoption of the ordinance for 60 days in order to allow the submission of an alternate petition for a different type of restriction for the same proposed overlay district. If such a petition is submitted during the 60-day period, city council may introduce an alternate ordinance in conformity with the subsequent petition and the ordinances shall, to the extent possible, be processed simultaneously. The planning commission shall include in its recommendations which ordinance it concludes, after public hearing, has the majority of the support of the property owners in the proposed district. 
(4)  No earlier than one year after the adoption of an ordinance establishing an overlay district, a petition for a change of the type of overlay district may be submitted by following the procedures for establishing an initial overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 1035C, 4-7-2004; Ord. No. 1091, 11-16-2004; Ord. No. 1251, 2-15-2011) 
Sec. 50-776. - Effect of overlay district ordinance. 
(a)  Upon introduction of an ordinance to create an overlay district and at all times while the ordinance is pending final decision, there shall be a moratorium on the issuance of initial rental unit licenses to the extent that no initial rental housing license shall be issued within the proposed overlay district to the owner of a one family dwelling unit that would be precluded if the overlay district was adopted, regardless of whether the license was applied for prior to or subsequent to the ordinance's introduction. If more than one ordinance is pending seeking alternate types of overlay districts pursuant to subsection 50-775(3), no initial license shall be issued within the proposed district that would be precluded if the most restrictive ordinance was adopted, regardless of whether the license was applied for prior to or subsequent to the ordinance's introduction. 
(b)  Upon passage of an ordinance by city council establishing an overlay district, no initial rental unit license shall be issued to an owner of property in the overlay district inconsistent with the restrictions of the overlay district and it shall be unlawful to use or allow any property to be used except in conformity with the requirements of the underlying zoning district and overlay district. Any property in the overlay district that has an existing rental housing license, or has had a rental housing license within one year of adoption of the overlay district, shall be allowed to continue its use and occupancy in accordance with the law existing prior to the date of the adoption of the overlay district. No existing rental housing use or occupancy in an overlay district shall be considered to be a nonconforming use as the result of adoption of an overlay district unless the rental license expires for more than one year. If an owner surrenders an existing license or allows, either intentionally or unintentionally, a license to remain expired for more than one year, any subsequent use of the property shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by the overlay district. 
(c)  Except as set forth in subsection 50-775(3), if an ordinance introduced pursuant to this section is denied, a subsequent ordinance for an overlay district that includes the same parcels may not be introduced for one year following introduction of the previous ordinance. 
(d)  Any ordinance which is not adopted within six months of its introduction shall be deemed denied unless the ordinance was tabled or otherwise delayed for 60 days pursuant to subsection 50-775(3), in which case it shall be deemed denied if not adopted within eight months of its introduction.

DIVISION 6. - EAST VILLAGE DISTRICT 

Sec. 50-790. - Defined area. 
    The East Village District is approximately 35 acres bound by Bogue Street to the west, Grand River Avenue to the north, Hagadorn Road to the east, and the Red Cedar River to the south (Fig. 1). The current information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shows that the 100-year floodplain and the floodway covers approximately 40 percent of the 35 acres. An update to these plans is expected sometime in 2006, and it is anticipated that this area will decrease. The boundary for the district was initially determined by the district master plan as reflected in Ordinance 1140. In the future, the district may expand if the expansion meets the intent of the district master plan. 

Figure 1. The properties master planned for the East Village District are located over the entire area between Bogue Street and Hagadorn Road south of Grand River Avenue and north of the Red Cedar River. 
(Ord. No. 1139, 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 50-791. - Definitions. 
    In addition to the definitions in sections 50-5-50-9, the following definitions shall apply to the East Village District: 
    Build-to line (BTL) means an alignment established a certain distance from the curb line to a line along which the building shall be built. Build-to lines vary for major streets and local streets and are dimensioned on the siting plans (see section 50-793). Build-to lines along Grand River Avenue will be based on the future right-of-way (R.O.W.) for Grand River Avenue improvements based on the 2000 Grand River Avenue Study and any future plans developed from the study. 
    Facade means the elevation or "face" of a building, from ground level to roof line. 
    Floodplain, 100-year means the low land near a watercourse which has been, or may be, covered by water of a flood of 100-year frequency, as established by engineering practices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It shall also mean that a flood of this magnitude may have a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Floodway encroachment means any fill, structure, building, accessory use, or development in the floodway. 
    Floodplain/floodway remediation means the process of improving the floodway capacity that has by natural and man-made circumstances decreased over the years, causing an increase in the 100-year floodplain. 
    Major streets shall be Grand River Avenue, Hagadorn Road, and Bogue Street. All other streets in the District shall be considered local streets. 
    Shared parking means parking spaces assigned to more than one use where persons utilizing the spaces are unlikely to need the spaces at the same time of day. 
    Siting means the location and placement of a building, structure, parking, or other objects. 

    Transparency means use of material that allows one to see into a building. 
    Traffic impact study means a plan prepared to determine the impacts, if any, that a proposed redevelopment plan would have on existing roads. The plan shall provide solutions and/or alternatives as needed. 
    Shared parking study means a plan prepared to determine the parking requirements based on the proposed uses and the expected range of time of day each use would require parking. The plan shall provide solutions and/or alternatives as needed. 
    Riverbank improvement plan means a plan prepared to determine where the use of riverbank improvement techniques would be beneficial to the river environment. The plan will be secondary to the city's floodplain/floodway remediation plan and shall be provided by the developer at the request of the city. 
    Street wall means the main wall of a structure that is closest to and most nearly parallel with an adjacent street. 
    New urbanism means the process of reintegrating the components of modern life (housing, workplace, shopping, and recreation) into compact, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use neighborhoods linked by transit. 
(Ord. No. 1139, 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 50-792. - Regulating plan. 
    East Village District has four form-based zones (Fig. 2): 
A.  Grand River Avenue/Bogue Street Area 
B.  Grand River Avenue Area I 
C.  Grand River Avenue Area II 
D.  Water's Edge Area 
Note: Exact boundaries for each zone are subject to change based on development plans that are consistent with the district master plan. 

E.  General requirements for each zone. 
(1)  [Intent.] The intent of the East Village Form-Based Zoning Codes are to provide for the economic, social, and environmental benefits of the East Village District. 
(2)  Economic. 
a.  In order to maximize the economic benefits of the district, redevelopment plans shall provide for an increase in density of the area while providing a mixture of uses, quality architecture, adequate parking facilities and site access. 
b.  Buildings in each zone can be up to eight stories and 112 feet in height and may provide a mixture of residential uses or office uses. Depending on the zone in which the building will be constructed, a building may be required to provide for office and retail uses on the first floor of the building. The city council may, upon an affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council, permit a maximum building height up to ten stories and 140 feet, as long as the additional building height will cause no significant negative impact on adjacent properties, public streets and parking facilities, or public utility and services. 
The first floor of any building may include various office, public/semi-public uses and lobbies for upper levels. Traffic impact and shared parking studies prepared by a professional transportation consultant are required to assure adequate access and that parking is neither insufficient nor excessive to accommodate the proposed mixture of uses. It is the responsibility of the developer to submit the plans prior to receiving preliminary site plan approval. 
(3)  Social. 
a.  In order to maximize the social benefits of the district, redevelopment plans shall provide for services and amenities which diversify such offerings within the zones. 
b.  Multi-family redevelopment plans shall provide mixed-market rental units, and may provide owner occupied housing, and low to moderate income housing. 
c.  Redevelopment plans shall demonstrate acceptable motorized and non-motorized circulation through the district and easy access for the surrounding neighborhoods and the university. 
d.  Redevelopment plans shall provide pedestrian-oriented, human-scale, street-level environments. This will be made possible through the requirements for first story transparency, build-to lines, minimum sidewalk widths, minimum and maximum building heights, and landscaping. It is the city's objective that alleys, patio seating, parks, and plazas designed to function for a variety of public events be incorporated through public/private cooperation and partnership as part of redevelopment plans for the district. It is also the city's objective that other elements such as outdoor dining and rooftop gardens be included in redevelopment plans where appropriate. 
(4)  Environmental. 
a.  In order to maximize the environmental benefits of the district, redevelopment plans must protect and improve the condition of the Red Cedar River and its banks. 
b.  When appropriate, the city shall contract a consultant specializing in floodplain/floodway remediation to prepare a floodplain/floodway remediation plan that shall provide the technical information needed to determine where and when remediation would benefit the environmental integrity of the river as well as the development opportunities along the river edge. The city may require, the preparation of a riverbank improvement plan by a consultant specializing in riverbank restoration shall be the responsibility of the developer. Such plan will be secondary to any floodplain/floodway remediation plan. When requested, the plan shall provide the technical information needed to determine where and how to improve the riverbank. The completion of this plan, when required, is necessary in order to grant final approval of redevelopment plans. 
c.  Stormwater management techniques, as determined by the city engineer, shall exceed minimum requirements of the city's stormwater management in areas that have the potential to pose the most significant threat to the quality of the river environment. Stormwater management techniques will also be required to cover as little usable open space as necessary to maintain proper function. This may require underground storage in certain areas. 
F.  Description of East Village Zones. 
(1)  Grand River Avenue Area I and Grand River Area II Zones. 
a.  These two zones are characterized by shallow depth, high visibility along Grand River Avenue, and premium river frontage (Fig. 4). 

Figure 4. Section showing development possibilities in the Grand River Avenue Area Zone utilizing required methods to develop within the confines of the Red Cedar River. 
b.  Note: Project sites may be required to provide a 25-foot riverbank buffer based on the findings of the floodplain/floodway remediation plan. 
c.  Any development frontage on Grand River Avenue is required to comply with setback standards and if the development contains housing, it shall contain a mixture of market rate housing types and contain office and retail uses on the ground floor unless waived by a three-fourths vote of the council because of the availability of adjacent or nearby retail preexisting uses. 
(2)  Grand River Avenue/Bogue Street Area Zone. 
a.  This zone is characterized by its frontage on two major streets, with increased visibility for businesses and its accessibility from campus. 

Figure 5. A graphic representation looking north on Bogue Street showing the potential character of the district as redeveloped under the intent of the Master Plan, Bondy Studio. 
b.  Redevelopment within this zone is required to meet setback standards and if the redevelopment contains housing, it is required to consist of a mixture of market rate housing opportunities and may provide for owner occupied and/or low to moderate income housing. Redevelopment projects in this zone are also required to contain office and retail uses on the ground floor in any Grand River Avenue frontage unless waived by a three-fourths vote of the council because of the availability of adjacent or nearby retail preexisting uses. 
c.  Redevelopment projects within this zone with frontage on the river are required to also comply with the standards set forth in section E(4). 
(3)  Waters Edge Area Zone. This zone is characterized by its premium river frontage and its central location between the other two zones in the district. The size and shape of the zone could accommodate public spaces large enough to support a variety of public events (Fig. 6). 

Figure 6. A graphic representation showing the character of the Red Cedar River Corridor as intended in the Master Plan, Bondy Studio. 
a.  Redevelopment within this district shall be consistent with all design standards applicable to the district except major street setback requirements. 
b.  Any redevelopment project within this zone that includes frontage on the river must comply with the requirements set forth in section E(1)(b), above.

3.  Forecasted trip generation of proposed use for the a.m. and p.m. peak hour and average day. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other commonly accepted sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three similar projects in Michigan. 
4.  Any additional information requested by the city engineer needed to summarize the full extent of traffic impacts. 
5.  A summary of findings. 
6.  Mitigation plan which may include measures such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques or a reduction in the proposed intensity of use. 
b.  The adequacy of parking facilities to meet the needs of a redevelopment proposal shall be verified by the submission of a study of shared parking prepared by a consultant specializing in shared parking studies. It shall clearly establish those uses that will utilize the shared spaces at different times of the day, week, month and year, including seasonal or mode adjustment factors, the study shall: 
1.  Be based on the most current Urban Land Institute's shared parking study methodology or other generally accepted methodology; 
2.  Address the size and type of activities, the composition of occupants, the rate of turnover for proposed shared spaces and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads; 
3.  Provide for a reduction by not more than 50 percent of the combined parking required for each use and no reduction in the number of spaces reserved for persons with disabilities. 
c.  Six on-site surface parking spaces are allowed for every one-half acre, or more, of redevelopment site for customer convenience and short-term loading and unloading. This may be met by six parallel parking spaces along a local street adjacent to the redevelopment site or six on-site parking spaces at the rear of the building off shared alleyways. All other required parking must be located within a parking structure. 
d.  Alleys must have a minimum width of 20 feet for access of public services. 
e.  Service and loading/unloading areas shall be located at the rear of buildings off shared alleyways. 
(3)  Public areas. 
a.  Public sidewalks must be a minimum of 22 feet wide on Grand River Avenue, 20 feet wide on Bogue Street and 14 feet wide on all local streets. Street trees, benches, bicycle racks, bus shelters, street lights, and any other amenities shall be located within the required sidewalk areas. 
b.  Public sidewalks shall be constructed with a combination of concrete and brick as shown on the siting plans (see subsections 50-793(E)(1)(3)). 
c.  Amenities located in public areas such as kiosks, benches, bus shelters, newspaper racks, and trash receptacles shall be consistent with the intent of the Downtown East Lansing Design Guidelines Manual. 
(4)  Landscaping and amenities. 
a.  Street trees shall be provided at a minimum of one for every 35 feet of street frontage along Grand River Avenue and Bogue Street, and one street tree for every 20 feet of frontage along local streets. These street trees may be placed an equal distance apart or clustered. 
b.  Surface parking areas located behind buildings off shared alleys shall provide a ten-foot buffer between the sidewalk and parking. A minimum of one street tree shall be provided per buffer. The remaining planting area should consist of a minimum of one species of evergreen shrub, two species of deciduous shrubs, and three species of perennials, including groundcovers (see subsections 50-793(E)(1) and (3). A three-foot high decorative wall with similar materials as used on the facade of adjacent buildings may be used in lieu of a ten-foot planting buffer for screening parking areas. All plant material must be suitable for urban conditions and be site appropriate for scale and light exposure. 
(5)  River protection. 
a.  Any redevelopment which has frontage on the river shall improve and maintain the floodway/floodplain in a way that protects the area from flooding consistent with development constraints due to the location of the 100-year floodplain. (Fig. 10). 
b.  At the city's request, a riverbank improvement plan shall be prepared by a consulting firm specializing in riverbank restoration at the developer's expense. The intent of this plan is to determine areas along the bank, for each individual development project, that are in need of stabilization in order to prevent erosion of the bank. When a plan is requested by the city, the plan shall make recommendations for bank stabilization and filtering contaminants from run-off prior to reaching the river. These methods must be incorporated into redevelopment plans.

Sec. 50-795. - Nonconforming uses and buildings. 
    Uses and buildings legally existing within the East Village zoning district at the time this division is adopted may be continued, although such uses or buildings do not conform to the standards of the district. The following provisions shall apply to nonconforming uses and buildings in this district: 
(1)  Except, as set forth in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph, a building which does not conform to the regulations of this district shall not be enlarged and a use which does not conform to the regulations shall not be extended throughout any parts of the structure that were not originally designed for that use unless the use and building are changed to comply with the regulations of this district. 
a.  The nonconforming use of a licensed rental occupancy may be extended throughout any parts of the building except that the addition or enlargement of a bedroom that is completely below grade and the conversion of a garage into a bedroom are prohibited. 
b.  Renovations or additions may be made to a nonconforming multiple family building which will not cumulatively increase the existing total floor area (meaning, for this provision only, the total of all interior square footage without basements or attics) by more than 20 percent pursuant to this provision and the renovations or additions do not result in increased occupancy. 
(2)  A nonconforming building shall not be converted in use in a way which would result in a higher parking requirement according to the ratios in section 50-812, regardless of the number of parking spaces present; except, buildings deemed to be culturally or historically significant by the city council may be converted in use consistent with the goals and objectives of the East Village Master Plan, subject to an approved special use permit as provided by article II, division 3, of this chapter.

Cross reference- Stopping, standing and parking, § 44-521 et seq. 

Sec. 50-811. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for adequate vehicular and bicycle parking space for differing types of land uses within the city, and to set standards for the construction and use of off-street parking and access facilities, so as to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. The specific requirements of this section are designed to provide standards for paving, curbing, and proper drainage of parking and access surfaces to prevent soil erosion and hazards to health from stagnating water and movement of loose materials; and to set minimum design standards, marking, and signage requirements to ensure proper traffic flow, sufficient area for parking and turning, safe ingress and egress onto streets, and sufficient access for public service vehicles, so as to prevent unnecessary threat or damage to property or life. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-812. - Required parking ratios. 
    It shall be the responsibility of both the owner and occupant of any property to provide off-street parking as required and regulated in this article. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, such parking shall be provided on the same premises with the use it is required to serve. The minimum number of required parking spaces shall be determined from the ratios listed below. Appropriate evidence, such as building floor plans and seating plans, shall be submitted to determine the minimum parking requirement for each use. Where per-roomer or per-person standards are used, the minimum parking space requirement shall be based upon the maximum potential occupancy of the dwelling as determined from relevant lot area and floor area standards in this chapter and chapter 6, article III of the City Code. Where per-seat standards are used but a fixed seating plan is not provided, the parking ratio for the use shall be based upon the maximum permitted occupancy of the identified room(s) as computed from the Uniform Building Code. Where buildings contain multiple tenancy, gross floor area shall exclude common public hallways, arcades, and mechanical/maintenance rooms which support the entire building. Where alternative standards are provided, the one resulting in the highest number of parking spaces shall be used. Where the computed ratios for a use result in a fractional requirement, the requirement shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of spaces. Also, the ratios below assume that typical accessory uses as permitted may be present and no additional parking spaces are required for them except as specifically stated in the standards below.

(3)  Consistent with the city's objectives to maximize open space and minimize the adverse effects of excess ground coverage on the general environment, neighboring properties, and storm sewers, the total amount of parking provided for uses that require 50 or more parking spaces shall not exceed a figure equal to 1.25 times the minimum parking requirement determined from 50-812 of this chapter. However, the developer of a project may obtain a waiver of the maximum allowable amount of parking or 1.25 times the minimum requirement under this Code where the applicant can demonstrate a need for additional parking spaces which cannot be appropriately satisfied by other off-premises or on-street parking spaces. The demonstration of need may be based on one or more of the following factors: 
a.  Employee, customer, tenant, or visitor demands. 
b.  Regular or seasonal peak demands. 
c.  Potential conversion of part or all of the property to a use which has a higher parking requirement. 
d.  Potential congestion or safety hazards, either on site or along adjacent public streets. 
Where anticipated parking needs and impacts cannot be accurately predicted, the city may require that construction of additional parking spaces in excess of the 1.25 ratio be deferred until the need for the additional spaces can be demonstrated by actual measurements. 
(4)  Consistent with the city's objectives to maximize open space and minimize the adverse effects of excess ground coverage in the RA, R-1, R-2 and R-3 low density residential zones and to minimize the adverse impacts of automobiles on neighboring properties and on the general environment, the total amount of parking provided for residential uses permitted in these zones, exclusive of driveways in front yards, shall not exceed six parking spaces, or 1.5 times the permitted residential occupancy, whichever is less. Residential parking includes a garage or paved surface, at least eight feet by 16 feet in size, which is accessible and can be used at all times for parking a motor vehicle.

_____
Sec. 50-814. - General parking regulations. 
(1)  Use of parking and access areas. Off-street parking spaces, stacking spaces, and access facilities shall be used solely for the purposes of parking and maneuvering motor vehicles except where otherwise allowed in this chapter. No commercial repair or service work on vehicles shall be conducted on any parking, storage, or access facilities, nor shall such facilities be used to park or store disabled, dismantled, inoperable, or unregistered vehicles. 
(2)  Parking in yards. No motor vehicle shall be parked on any yard except upon a driveway or parking space designed and constructed according to the standards of this chapter. 
(3)  Residential parking. In residential districts no parking space shall be provided in a front yard, or in an exposed side yard of a corner lot, except in conjunction with a single-family, two-family, or townhouse structure. Parking spaces may be placed on a driveway and in a tandem arrangement, provided that, no more than 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces are totally or partially located in the front yard or exposed side yard, and provided further that no parking space extends into a public right-of-way. 
(4)  Off-premises parking. In order to encourage the use of public transportation, limit the amount of impervious surface, thereby reducing stormwater runoff, and support redevelopment efforts in older structures, the City of East Lansing allows for off-premises parking under certain circumstances. For multiple-family uses, office uses, or uses located in any of the B business districts of this chapter, the required off-street parking facilities may be provided on a property separate from that of the use such facilities are intended to serve, subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Off-premises parking facilities must be located within one of the B business districts, the P parking district, the municipal parking system, or other locations as approved by city council. 
1.  Off-premises parking facilities for multiple-family residential uses must be located within one-quarter of a mile of the use they are intended to serve, as measured between properties along probable pedestrian pathways or documentation shall be provided to demonstrate convenient access through public or private mass transit. 
2.  Off-premises parking facilities for office or retail uses must be located within 500 feet of the use they are intended to serve, as measured along probable pedestrian pathways. Where a portion of an off-street parking lot or a contiguous series of on-street parking spaces falls within the 500-foot area, all of the spaces within the lot or the series of spaces shall be counted. 
b.  Off-premises parking facilities must be improved and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
c.  Evidence must be submitted that such off-premises parking facilities will remain available to serve the intended use. If utilizing a municipal parking facility, parking passes must be purchased on a yearly basis and if using other locations documentation shall be updated on a yearly basis or approval under this section shall expire and the extent and occupancy of the use shall be restricted proportionately to the minimum requirement for the use under this chapter and the number of parking spaces available on site. 
d.  Off-premises parking facilities must not be necessary to meet the requirements of another use. 
e.  Off-premises parking facilities shall be reviewed in conjunction with the use they are intended to serve and shall be considered an integral part of any approval granted to the use they are intended to serve. 
f.  Notwithstanding items (a) through (e) of this subsection, city council may approve or deny the request for off-premises parking based on the proximity of public transit, the type(s) of uses proposed for the site, the proximity to major employment, and/or education facilities and the general standards of section 50-36. 
(5)  Maximum use restriction. If fewer spaces are available to serve a use than the minimum requirement for the use under the standards of this chapter, the extent and occupancy of the use shall be restricted proportionately to the number of parking spaces available. 
(6)  Mixed use. Where two or more uses occupy a property or occupy adjoining properties which are developed with shared parking and access facilities under a single site plan, the following rules apply: 
a.  The combined parking requirement shall be the sum of the individual requirements for each use present except as follows: 
1.  In the B-2 and B-3 districts, where the mixed use includes a residential use, the parking requirements otherwise established by this Code for the residential portion of the use are reduced by 50 percent. 
2.  Where the individual uses are expected to experience peak parking demands at different times, where the individual uses serve complementary functions, or where the property owner demonstrates that due to the specific type of uses, proximity to transit, proximity to public parking and other circumstances that the parking demands of the building or buildings will be met with less parking than otherwise required by this chapter, the city council may permit an appropriate reduction of the combined parking requirement in conjunction with site plan approval, in addition to any other reductions authorized by this chapter. 
b.  For existing buildings, the planning and zoning official may permit a reduction of the combined parking requirement by up to 25 percent where the property owner provides written evidence, such as a lease or condominium bylaws, which limits the hours of operation of individual tenants to ensure that peak parking demands do not exceed the number of parking spaces present. 
(7)  Changes in use. Any change in the use or occupancy of a property which would result in a higher parking requirement according to the ratios in section 50-812 or any change in use from a specific use that caused the city council to grant a reduction from the requirements of this Code, regardless of the number of parking spaces present, shall be considered an expansion of the use and shall be subject to the review procedures and standards specified in this chapter. This provision shall not apply where a reduction of the combined parking requirement for a multiple tenant building has been granted under subsection (f) above so that the peak parking demand for the property does not increase. For any expansion of a use, all existing and proposed parking and access facilities shall be improved and maintained in accordance with the standards of this chapter. 
(8)  Motorcycle parking. Up to three vehicular parking spaces on a property may be converted to motorcycle parking spaces, consistent with the dimensional standards in section 50-816(1). For every four motorcycle parking spaces provided, required automobile parking can be reduced by one space.

b.  The boundaries, with dimensions, of existing and proposed paving on the lot and the location and dimensions of parking spaces. 
c.  The location and dimensions of any buildings or other structures on the lot. 
d.  The nature of the paving material or materials to be used and the nature of adjacent ground cover. 
e.  A landscape plan if required under subsection 50-840(1). 
f.  For pavement expansions, existing and proposed grades are required. 
(2)  Permit issuance. The paving permit shall identify the property upon which the paving is to be installed and describe the specific area which is to be paved and the type of surface to be used. The paving permit shall be posted in a conspicuous location on the lot during the paving operation. 
(3)  Nonconforming paving. A paving permit may be issued for a driveway or parking space pavement reconstruction as defined in section 50-8 which legally exists at the time of adoption of this provision as long as it meets the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed reconstruction shall not increase or extend any existing nonconformity. 
b.  The proposed reconstruction shall not cause or permit a change in the occupancy or use of the property. 
c.  The proposed reconstruction shall not increase the number of parking spaces provided on the property. 
d.  The proposed reconstruction does not increase the quantity of stormwater runoff directed to adjacent private properties. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-816. - Parking and access facility design standards. 
    Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, parking and access facilities shall be designed according to the following standards. 
(1)  Parking space size. Each parking space shall be a rectangular area a minimum of 20 feet in length and nine feet in width, exclusive of driveways. In conjunction with single-family, two-family, and townhouse structures, parking spaces may be on a driveway and may be a minimum of eight feet wide and 18 feet long. Motorcycle parking spaces shall be a minimum of eight feet in length and four feet in width. Where 25 or more parking spaces are required for a use, up to 30 percent of the number of required spaces may be reduced in size, but not less than a minimum of eight feet wide and 16 feet long. Some number of parking spaces may be required to be wider than the minimums stated above to be accessible for physically handicapped persons. 
(2)  Driveway width. Driveways shall be at least eight feet wide for one-way travel and at least 18 feet wide for two-way travel. Driveway aisles within a parking lot that provide access into abutting parking spaces shall be developed according to the following standards. 
Parking Space 
Arrangement Minimum Aisle 
Width Parallel parking 12-foot aisle width 30° angle parking 11-foot aisle width 45° angle parking 13-foot aisle width 60° angle parking 18-foot aisle width 90° angle parking 20-foot aisle width*  
*If the driveway is regularly used by sanitary trucks, delivery trucks, or other large vehicles, the minimum width shall be increased to 24 feet. 
If abutting parking spaces are arranged at an angle other than those listed above, the minimum driveway width shall be determined according to the next highest standard from the table. For example, if 75-degree angle parking is provided, the minimum driveway width shall be the standards for 90-degree angle parking, or 20 feet. 
(3)  Yard paving restriction. In all residential districts, the amount of paving in a front yard and in a side yard along a street on a corner lot shall not exceed an amount equal to 25 percent of the front yard area as defined in section 50-9 of this chapter or up to 35 percent where 10 percent of the paving is pervious paving material. On lots within the RA, R-1, R-2, and R-3 districts, no more than 30 percent of the rear yard may be used for parking and access facilities, inclusive of garages, carports, and surface paving. 
(4)  Parking and driveway setbacks. Except as provided for in subsection (7) of this section, parking spaces and driveways shall be set back according to the provisions of this chapter. In no case shall a parking space or driveway be placed closer than eight feet from a rear lot line or three feet from any other property line, except where the driveway must penetrate across the lot line to provide access to the adjacent street or alley. A parking space may be located contiguous to an alley when the space is directly accessed from the alley. If the closed end of a parking space abuts a front, rear, or side yard, or a required landscape screen, or is eight feet or less from a property line, wheel stops, bumper guards, or similar devices shall be placed to prohibit vehicles from extending beyond the end of the parking space.

If the building official and city engineer determine that an existing driveway or parking area has been properly maintained, the driveway or parking area may be replenished with the above material without having to meet the minimum subgrade and base requirements set forth under subsection 50-816(5). The building official and city engineer shall take into account the nature of the use, such as heavy transient vehicle movement and the number of vehicles parked or stored, when making the determination. 
c.  Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) aggregate (i.e., crushed stone) designated as 6A shall be used to maintain or reconstruct front yard driveways and paving areas except when the building official and city engineer have approved an alternate material, meeting the gradation of the required aggregate, due to circumstances unique to a property. MDOT aggregate designated as 22A or 23A shall be used to maintain or reconstruct side and rear yard parking areas except when the building official and city engineer have approved an alternate material, meeting the gradation of the required aggregate, due to circumstances unique to the property.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1287, adopted June 18, 2013, amended and renumbered former art. IX, §§ 50-851-50-857 as art. X, §§ 50-851-50-857. The former art. IX, pertained to nonconforming uses and buildings, and derived from the 1994 Code, ch. 55, §§ 5.131-5.137; and Ord. No. 1117, adopted Feb. 7, 2006. 

Sec. 50-851. - Continuation generally. 
    The lawfully permitted use of land or structures existing at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto may be continued, although such use does not conform to the standards of the district in which such land or building is located. Such uses shall be deemed nonconforming uses. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-852. - Nonconforming use of land. 
    Where no structure is involved, the nonconforming use of land may be continued, provided however: 
(1)  A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance, unless specifically allowed by other provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such nonconforming use at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(3)  If a nonconforming use of land, or any portion thereof, ceases for any reason for any continuous period of more than 30 days, or is changed to a conforming use, any future use of the land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-853. - Nonconforming use of a structure. 
(1)  Except as authorized herein, a structure, the use of which does not conform to the use regulations for the district in which it is situated, shall not be enlarged unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use. If the use is nonconforming only as a result of its licensed rental occupancy, the structure may be enlarged by an addition if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The addition, based on the floor area in existence at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, increases the existing total floor area (meaning, for this provision only, the total of all interior square footage without basements or attics) by no more than 20 percent pursuant to this provision. 
b.  The addition is located on the side or rear of the structure or is constructed as one or more dormers. 
c.  The addition is not added to an area that is partly or completely below grade. 
d.  The addition is in compliance with all other laws and regulations. 
(2)  Except as authorized herein, a structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be structurally altered or reconstructed unless: 
a.  Such alterations are required by law; or 
b.  It is maintenance and repair work that is required to keep the structure in sound condition; or 
c.  The structural alterations are permitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this section; or 
d.  The use is nonconforming only as a result of its licensed rental occupancy and the structural alterations do not do any of the following: 
(i)  Add any bedrooms that are partly or completely below grade or enlarge any bedrooms that are partly or completely below grade. 
(ii)  Convert an existing garage into a bedroom. 
(iii)  Combine a licensed rental unit with another licensed rental unit or unlicensed dwelling unit unless the subsequent use is a conforming use. 
(3)  Except for a use that is a nonconforming licensed rental occupancy, a nonconforming use may not be extended throughout any parts of the structure which were not originally designed for such use. 
(4)  A nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to a conforming use. 
(5)  If a nonconforming use of a structure ceases for any reason for a continuous period of more than one year, or is changed to a conforming use, or if the structure in which such use is conducted or maintained is moved for any distance whatsoever, for any reason, then any future use of such structure shall be in conformity with the standards specified by the zoning ordinance for the district in which such structure is located. 
(6)  If a structure in which a nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is removed, the subsequent use of the land on which such structure was located, and the subsequent use of any structure thereon, shall be in conformity with the standards specified by the zoning ordinance for the district in which such land or structure is located. 
(7)  Changing the use of a nonconforming single-family or two-family residential structure to a rental dwelling (licensed or unlicensed) for occupancy by other than a family or domestic unit (as defined by this chapter) shall be deemed a change which enlarges or extends the nonconforming use of a structure, except in the following circumstances: 
a.  For so long as the owner of the structure, as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, continues to reside in said structure; and/or 
b.  For so long as the owner of the structure, as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, continues to own said structure. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013; Ord. No. 1382, 11-9-2016; Ord. No. 1432, 9-18-2018) 
Sec. 50-854. - Nonconformity other than use. 
    A structure which is conforming in use but which does not conform to all of the other requirements of the zoning ordinance for the district in which said structure is located shall not be considered to be nonconforming with the meaning of section 50-853 and section 50-855. However, no permit shall be issued and no changes shall be made on the structure or the land on which such structure is located that will result in the increase of any such nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-855. - Restoration of damaged structures. 
    Whenever any structure legally nonconforming in use is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, wind, flood, or other catastrophe to an extent greater than its state equalized value as determined by the city assessor, then any future use of the structure and land on which the structure is located shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district in which such structure is located. 
(1)  Where such a structure is damaged to an extent less than its assessed value, it may be rebuilt and the use continued, but not to any greater extent than in the previously existing structure; but where such rebuilding can feasibly be done in greater conformity with this chapter in the opinion of the East Lansing Building Official, he/she shall so require in any building permit, provided, that any such structure licensed as a rental on November 8, 1995, may be rebuilt to the extent necessary to retain the occupancy permitted by license on November 8, 1995. 
(2)  Whenever a legally nonconforming structure which was licensed as a rental on November 8, 1995, is damaged to an extent greater than its state equalized value, such structure may be rebuilt and the use continued to the extent necessary to retain the maximum occupancy permitted by license on November 8, 1995; but the East Lansing Building Official shall require in any building permit that such rebuilding shall otherwise be done so as to obtain the maximum conformity with this chapter which may be feasible for the permitted occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-856. - Registration of nonconforming use of land or structures. 
    Any nonconforming use of land or structures may be registered in the office of the East Lansing Building Official within one year after the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. Such registration shall include the identification of the premises, a description of the nature and extent of the nonconforming use, and if necessary to the description, a plot plan, drawn to scale, showing property lines, all structures, and any other pertinent information, and an affidavit by the owner as to the date since which such nonconforming use has existed. Failure to so register shall place the burden of proof on the property owner that any alleged nonconforming use of land or structures legally existed at the time this chapter or any amendment thereto became effective. 
(Ord. No. 1287, 6-18-2013) 
Sec. 50-857. - Small lots owned separately. 
    Nothing in the area requirements of this chapter relating to lot width or area per family shall prohibit the erection of a one-family dwelling on a lot held under a separate and distinct ownership from contiguous lots and which has been under such separate and distinct ownership since a date prior to the 1960 zoning ordinance, even though such lot has less width or less area than the lot area per family requirement of this chapter for the district in which such lot is located, provided that all other regulations of the district are complied with.
