601.01 Intent and Primary Use; Open Space; and Public Recreation. To identify public to
quasi to public lands which provide for open space, public or recreational use.
601.01 Types of Zoning Districts. Land within the City is generally classified by this
ordinance to be within one of two base zoning districts. Land within any base zoning district
may also be classified into one or more overlay zoning districts. As specifically denoted, some
overlay districts have regulations that will always apply regardless of the base zoning district
prov1s1ons.
601.02 Overlay Zoning Use Districts. At the time of adoption ofthis Ordinance or at some
future date, the Governing Body may adopt overlay districts to promote specific orderly
development or to protect some specific sensitive natural resource
601.02 Establishment of Base Districts. The following base zoning districts are hereby
established:
R-1 Single Family Residential
R-2 Single Family Residential
601.03 Establishment of Overlay Districts. Overlay districts within St. Mary's Point are
separated into two classifications to distinguish how they relate to underlying base zoning district
provisiOns.
(1) Complementary Overlay Districts
(2)
Complementary overlay district regulations are to be read in addition to underlying base
zoning district regulations. Whenever there is a conflict between overlay and base zoning
district provisions, the more restrictive provision shall apply. The following
complementary overlay districts are hereby established:
Commercial Food Production Overlay Zone (CFP): Preserve commercial agriculture
as a viable permanent land use and a significant economic activity within the community.
Areas designated CFP would provide land area for permanent economically viable
commercial food production.
Airport Protection Overlay Zone (AZ): Protect life from potential aircraft catastrophe
and noise by restricting development in Airport Zones.
Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone (PUD): Allow innovative and flexible
design for developments that are more sympathetic to both man and nature, and which
are not possible under current regulations.
Flood Plain Protection (FP): Protect the natural environment, homes and other
structures from flood waters by preserving the natural overflow areas of lakes, streams
and rivers.
Prevailing Overlay Districts
Prevailing overlay district reg1tions are to be read as superseding all underlying base
zoning district regulations. Whenever there is a conflict between overlay and base zoning
district provisions, the preva:lling overlay district regulation will always apply. Base
zoning district regulations will onl;: be in effect when the prevailing overlay district does
not address a specific circumstance. The following prevailing overlay districts are hereby
established: .
Riverway District (RW): Conserve and protect the natural environment of the St. Croix
River Valley by ensuring man-made impacts near the river adhere to set standards. Subdistricts
of the riverway district may include:

LS-1
LS-2
Intent and Primary Use

which parcels of land in the Residential, A -1 and A-2 Districts having unusual building
characteristics due to sub-soil conditions, elevation of water table, water area, relative location or
shape of the parcel, may be more efficiently used. Cluster development may also provide a means
to preserve good agricultural land, open green space, scenic views and other desirable features of
the natural environment. The owner of any tract ofland in any Residential, A-1 and A-2 District
may submit a plan on the use and development of such tract ofland as a cluster development to the
Governing Body for a conditional use permit authorizing completion of the project according to the
plan. The plan for the proposed project shall conform to the requirements of the use district within

published herewith and made part of this chapter, said map is designated as the Official Zoning
Map ofthe community and shall be maintained as provided herein by the community zoning
administrator. The district boundary lines on said map are intended to follow street right-of-way
lines, street centerlines or lot lines unless such boundary line is otherwise indicated on the map. ill
the case of unsubdivided property or in any case where street or lot lines are not used as boundaries,
the district boundary lines shall be determined by use of dimensions or the scale appearing on the
map. All ofthe notations, references and other information shown thereon shall have the same
force and effect as if fully set forth herein and are hereby made a part of this chapter by reference
and incorporated herein as fully as if set forth herein at length. Whenever any street or other public
way is vacated, any zoning district line following the centerline of said vacated street or way shall
not be affected by such vacation.

other conflict appears in this chapter with respect to permitted uses within a district, the more
restrictive portion shall be applied.
Where any proposed use for any district is not listed in Section 604 herein but is determined
by the City Council to be similar in character to a use listed in Section 604, the City Council may
require the proponent ofthat use to proceed under provision ofthis Ordinance applicable to that
similar use. Where any proposed use for any district is not listed in Section 604 and is determined
by the City Council not to be similar in character to any use listed therein, that proposed use shall be
allowed in any district. Such a determination by the City Council shall not preclude the proponent
ofthe use from making immediate application to the city for Amendment of this Ordinance

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS
301. Construction.
301.01. In the event of conflicting provisions in the text of
this Ordinance, and/or other Ordinances, the more restrictive
provision shall apply. The Community Zoning Administrator shall
determine which is more "restrictive'' and appeals from such
determination may be made in the manner provided herein.
301.02. Words used in the present tense include the past and
future tense; the singular number includes the plural and the plural
includes the singular; the word "shall" is mandatory, the word "may"
is permissive.
301.03. Unless otherwise specified, all distances shall be
measured horizontally.
302. Definitions.
302.01. For the purpose of this Ordinance, certain phrases and
words are hereby defined as follows:
(1) Accessory Use. A use subordinate to and serving the
principal use on the same lot and customarily
incidental thereto, such as vegetative cutting and
grading and filling.
(2) Appurtenance. A structure subordinate to and serving
the principal structure on the same lot and customarily
incidental thereto such as garages, decks, essential
services, signs, docks, and stairways and lifts, except
that appurtenance does not include private water supply
and sewage and waste disposal systems below the ground.
(3) Bluffline. A line along the top of a slope connecting
the points at which the slope, proceeding away from the
river or adjoining watershed channel, becomes less than
twelve percent (12%) and it only includes slopes
greater than twelve percent (12%) visible from the
river or any water course tributary to the river. The
location of the bluffline for any particular property
shall be certified by a registered land surveyor or the
Zoning Administrator. More than one (1) bluffline may
be encountered proceeding away from the river or
adjoining watershed channel. All setbacks required
herein shall be applicable to each bluffline.
(4) Building Line. A line measured across the width of the
lot at the point where the principal structure is
placed in accordance with setback provisions.
2
(5) Channel. A natural or artificial depression of
perceptible extent with a definite bed and banks to
confine and conduct flowing water either continuously
or periodically.
(6) Dwelling Unit. A residential accommodation which is
arranged, designed, used, or intended for use
exclusively as living quarters for one (1) family.
(7) Harbor. A portion of a body of water along or landward
of the natural shoreline deep enough for recreational

shoreline features as to provide protection from winds,
waves, ice, and currents. Natural harbors consist of
bays and estuaries, while artificial harbors are
constructed by dredging.
(8) - Marina. An area of concentrated small craft mooring,
where ancillary facilities may be provided for some or
all of such services as fueling, sewage pumpout, boat
launching, boat repair, and boat storage; except that
marina does not mean temporary docks associated with
riparian residential development if the mooring area is
of a size not to exceed the resource limitations of the
site and the needs of the residents of the development.
(9) Nonconforming Use. Any use of land established before
the effective date of a St. Croix Riverway Ordinance
which does not conform to the use restrictions of a
particular zoning district. This should not be
confused with substandard dimensions of a conforming
use.
(10) Ordinary High Water Mark. A mark delineating the
highest water level which has been maintained for a
sufficient period of time to leave evidence upon the
landscape. The ordinary high water mark is commonly
that point where the natural vegetation changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial. In
areas where the ordinary high water mark is not
evident, setbacks shall be measured from the stream
bank of the following water bodies that have permanent
flow or open water; the main channel, adjoining side
channels, backwaters, and sloughs.
(11) Riverway Boundary. A legally described line
delineating the landward extent of the St. Croix
Riverway.
(12) Scenic Easement. An interest in land, less than fee
title, that limits the use of the land for the purpose
of protecting the scenic, recreational, and natural
characteristics of areas in the St. Croix Riverway.
Unless otherwise expressly and specifically provided by
mutual aareement of the parties, the easemen~ shall be:

Unless specifically provided by the parties, no such
easement shall give the holder or any beneficiary the
right to enter on the land except for enforcement of
the easement.
(13) Screening. The presence of vegetation or topography
which makes any structure on any property visually
inconspicuous in summer months as viewed from the
river.
(14) Setback. The minimum horizontal distance between any
part of a structure and the ordinary high water mark or
a bluffline. In areas where the ordinary high water
mark is not evident, setbacks shall be measured from
the stream bank of the following water bodies that have
permanent flow or open water: the main channel,
adjoining side channels, backwaters, and sloughs.
(15) Slope. All lands between the ordinary high water mark
and the riverway boundary having an angle of ascent or
descent of more than twelve percent (12%) from the
horizontal.

INTRODUCTION
~ashington County is but one of the land areas making up the Saint
t :inneapolis seven county Metropolitan Area. Its present land use
a~~cter is varied -- as in any area, but predominantly it is made of
ricultural land units. Its proximity to the core of the metropolitan
ea suggests that with the forecasted expansion of population, the land
e in Washington County will continue to change as it has in the last
fteen years. In regard to land use, the changes will be in the direction
smaller pieces of land for housing and commercial uses, and finally
rge scale commercial use such as sales, office, multiple dwelling or
ncentrated housing developments.
During the course of such change, on a large or small scale, land
ldings are divided into lots with provision for new streets and for the
sic utilities such as power, telephone, water and sewer. This conversion
land into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation
ensure an attractive, efficient and safe community environment.
ovision must also be made for possible future resubdivision, for after
e subdivision of a land parcel has been approved and buildings permitted,
e same standards must be met by future resubdivision. The division,
nbination or resubdivision of land parcels are the first step in shaping
~ physical character of a community and as such are important process
ich should be subject· to public regulation.
Adequate, up-to-date Subdivision Regulations, as well as good
1inistration and enforcement, are the tools to control the change in land
~. These Subdivision Regulations must reflect the desire of the County
o ined in its Comprehensive Development Plan. Because the County's
~L . will vary as an area progresses toward urbanization, both the
1prehensive Plan and Subdivision Regulations need periodic review 
. ally, of course, the zoning requirements outline the actual land area
.ge controlled by the Subdivision Regulations within the framework of the
.prehensi ve Plan.
WHY PLAT
The land use pattern of Washington County is changing from an
icultural land use, which required large parcels of land, to an urban
i use, requiring much smaller parcels. Land has been bought and sold
ng metes and bounds descriptions, but now with smaller parcels being
'ht and sold the practice of describing them by metes and bounds is no
~er practical.
Many metes and bounds descriptions, past and present, written by
1alified people do not properly describe conveyance of land. Overlaps
gaps have been created by these poor descriptions and can only be
~ected by the courts. Descriptions based on a good boundary survey can
~hecked, therefore the record plat is a highly desirable instrument.
underlying description of the property to be platted can be adjusted or
·ected, based on a boundary survey. The recorded plat then becomes a
.1 rlocument denoting lots and blocks as the subdivision of the described
:t  land. Clean, simple and accurate conveyances can then be made and
:r. l as Lot, Block-Plat Name.

The present platting system was established to provide a simple
system for keeping records of the division and ownei'ship of land.
Minnesota Statutes give the registered land surveyor exclusive rights
to prepare plats. The statutes also set minimum standards that the
surveyor must meet, and regulate the plat itself, as to information
required, size, number and kind. The reader is referred to the
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 505 and the standard procedures for
platting in Washington County.
HOW PLATTING IS ACCOMPLISHED
Prior to the preparation of a plat, the subdividers or owners
should meet with local officials, with the Washington County Planning
Department, and the County Engineer in order to be made fully aware
of all applicable ordinances, regulations, and plans in the area to
be subdivided. At this time or at a subsequent informal meeting, the
subdivider should submi~ a general sketch plan of the proposed
subdivision and preliminary proposals for the provision of water
supply and waste disposal. The sketch plan can be presented in
simple form but should show any zoning changes which would be
required, and should show that consideration has been given to the
relationship of the proposed subdivision to existing community
facilities that would serve it, to neighboring subdivisions and
development, and to the topography of the site. The subdivider is
urged to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the Planning
Department and the local g·overning body at this point in order to
save time and effort and facilitate the approval of the plat.
The next step is for the subdivider to prepare a preliminary
plat for the area to be subdivided. The preliminary plat is a very
detailed drawing showing the proposed development and necessary
accessory information. It contains more detail than is required on
the sketch plan and serves as the basis for the public hearing. It
also serves as the master plan for a development where subdividing a
piece of land is carried out stepwise, by a series of plats, where
the first plat which is approved and recorded may be only part of the
total plan, and may later be followed by other plats, all in
conformity with the overall plan.
After the preliminary plat is approved, the subdivider will have
his surveyor prepare a final plat covering all or part of the land to
be subdivided. The final plat is a legal document designed primarily
to record in the county offices the exact boundaries and location of
parcels of land. Before the governing body will approve the plat, it
will usually require the subdivider to agree to do certain things,
such as pave streets. The governing body will make sure that all
such matters are agreed to by the subdivider, and are covered as
necessary by written contract, and by bond, before the plat is
approved.·

( The following briefly outlines the platting process·for
' unincorporated communities in Washington County:
(1) Prepare Sketch Plan. Meet with township officials and
Planning Department to discuss zoning requirements and
platting procedure.
(2) Prepare Preliminary Plat. Submit seven (7) copies to
County Surveyor in order to be placed on agenda for
Washington County Plat Commission.
(3) Submit Preliminary Plat to township officials for review
and public hearing after review by the Washington County
Plat Commission.
(4) Submit preliminary plat to watershed district for review
and approva~. If lakeshore property, preliminary plat
must also be submitted to the Minnesota Department of
Natural .Resources.
(5) Prepare Final Plat. After the Washington County Plat
Commission and local governing body has given preliminary
plat approval, submit copies to County Surveyor and to
the Washington .County_Plat Commission for approval.
(6) Submit final plat to township officials for approval.
(7) Obtain all required signatures and final approval by
County Board.

SECTION 1. PURPOSE
101. The process of dividing raw land into home sites, or
lparate parcels for other uses, is one of the most important factors
L the growth of any community. Few activities have a more lasting
:feet upon its appearance and environment. Once the land has been
1bdivided into urban lots and the streets, homes, and other
~ructures have been constructed, the basic character of this
!rmanent addition to the community has become firmly established.
~ is then virtually impossible to alter its basic character without
1bstantial expense. In most subdivisions, roads and streets must be
~intained and various public service must be provided. The welfare
: the entire community is thereby affected in many important
~spects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the general public,
1e developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived,
~signed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper
t.andards.
All subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval shall
~lly comply, in all respects, with the regulations set forth
erein. It is the purpose of these regulations to:
(1) Encourage well planned, efficient, and attractive
subdivisions by establishing adequate standards for design
and construction.
( 2) Provide for the health and safety of residents by
requiring properly designed streets and adequate sewage
and water service.
(3) Place the cost of improvements against those benefiting
from their construction.
( 4) Secure the rights of the public with respect to public
lands and waters.
(5) Set the minimum requirements necessary to protect the
public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general
welfare.

such public water system.
(7) Public Sanitary Sewer. In all cases where trunk line
sanitary sewer facilities are available, the subdivider
shall be required to install sanitary sewers in the plat
and connect the same to such trunk line sewers. If such
facilities are not available but it is expected they will
be within five (5) years, the governing body may require
that such sewers, together with all necessary laterals
extending from the main sewer to the street curb shall be
installed and capped for future connection as service
becomes available. In that event .the subdivider may also
install on-site disposal units provided they are so
31
( 8)
located as to permit easy and the least expensive
connection to the sewer when it becomes available and
usable. Where such on-site units are installed, the
subdivider shall provide underground plumbing to extend
three (3) feet beyond the footing which plumbing shall be
plugged. The area around the stack shall be scored so
that the septic tank line can be disconnected and
connection can be made with the public sanitary sewer

.sed only in part to the improved property and the remaining cost
out of general tax levy, provision may be made for the payment
portion of the cost by the community. Further, if any
-vement installed within the subdivision will be of substantial
'it to lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, provision
e made for causing a portion of the cost of the improvements,
·senting the benefit to such lands, to be assessed against the
In such a situation, the subdivider will be required only to
'or such portion of the whole cost of said .improvement as will
·sent the benefit to the property within the subdivision.
803. Agreement Providing for the Installation of Improvements.
803.01. Prior to the installation of any required improvements
,rior to approval of the plat, the subdivider shall enter into a
·act in writing with the local community requiring the subdivider

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE WASHINGTON COUNTY SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE
REGULATING THE SUBDIVISION OF L~ND IN WASHINGTON COUNTY.
The Board of Commissioners of Washington County ordains:
SECTION 1:
SECTION 2:
SECTION 3:
I
Amend Section 604.01 of the Washington County I
Subdivision Ordinance by deleting this section in it~
entirety and replacing it with the following:
Section 604.01. Cul-de-sac or other dead-end
streets, permanently designed as such shall not exceed
600 feet in length in subdivisions in which lots are
less than 2 1/2 acres in size. In subdivisions where
lots are 2 1/2 acres in size or greater, cul-de-sacs
permanently designed as such shall not exceed 1/4 mire
in length. In subdivisions in which lots are 2 1/2
acres or greater, temporary cul-de-sacs shall not exceed
2,640 feet nor provide access to more than 20
homesites. ·In subdivisions in which lots are less than
2 1/2 acres, temporary cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 800
feet nor provide access to more than 20 home sites.
Temporary cul-de-sacs are those in which it can be
clearly shown that the road could reasonably continue
and would ~esult in a through road at some time in the
foreseeable future.
A variance to this section may be granted only for
a permanent cul-de-sac· and only if it can be clearly
shown that by reason of u~favorable land form, or the
irregular shape of the land from which the subdivision
is made, a normal st~eet pattern cannot be established,
or that land would be wasted by not granting such a
variance.
The Zoning Administrator is hereby directed to change
the Washington County Subdivision Ordinance in
accordance with the foregoing amendment.
Effective Date. This Ordinance shall be and is hereby
de.clared to be in full force and effect from and after
its passage and publication according to law.

CHAPTER 402, FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
ESTABLISHING FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS FOR THE CITY OF ST. MARY'S POINT
THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ST. MARY'S POINT, WASHINGTON COUNTY,
MINNESOTA, DOES ORDAIN:
Section 1. Amendment. Chapter 402 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of St.
Mary's Point is hereby amended to delete the same in its entirety.
Section 2. Adoption. The Code of Ordinances for the City of St. Maty's Point is
hereby amended to add a Chapter 402 adopting a Flood Plain Management Ordinance Establishing
Flood Plain Management Regulations for the City of St. Mary's Point, and further providing as
follows:
"402 FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
402.010 Statutory Authorization. Findings of Fact and Purpose.
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Mi1mesota has, in Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 1 03F and Chapter 462, delegated the responsibility to local government units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of St. Mary's Point,
Minnesota does ordain as follows:
B. Findings of Fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of St. Mary's Point, Minnesota, are subject to
periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established
by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 402.010 B.1 by
provisions contained herein.
402.020 General Provision~.
A. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of St. Mary's Point, and shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the
attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or
General Flood Plain Districts.
B. Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map together with all
materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
ordinance. The attached material shall include the document entitled as "Flood Hazard
Boundary Map and Flood Insurance Rate Map", dated September 26, 1975; the "Flooded Areas
of St. Mary's Point, Minnesota", prepared by the U.S. Geologic Survey, 1971; and the "Letter of
Map Revision" prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated January 13,
1987. The Official Zoning Map and attached materials shall be on file in the Office ofthe City
Clerk for the City of St. Mary's Point.
C. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall
be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any
increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
D. Interpretation.
1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the
Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by
State Statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a
formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make
the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year)
flood profile and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district
boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board and to
submit technical evidence.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside
the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of St. Mary's
Point or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
G. Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance
shall not be affected thereby.
402.030 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall
be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to
give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.
(1) Accessory Use or Structure- a use or structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
(2) Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having
its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of
excavation below ground level.
(3) Conditional Use- means a specific type of structure or land use listed in
the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with
appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes
and upon a finding that:
(a) certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, and
(b) the structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land
use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing
neighborhood.
( 4) Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of
flood way boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying
a proportionate share of flood flows.
(5) Flood- a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the
stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
(6) Flood Frequency- the frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
(7) Flood Fringe- that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway.
Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "Zone AlO" used on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map
for the City of St. Mary's Point, Minnesota.
(8) Flood Plain- the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
(9) Flood-Proofing - a combination of structural provisions, changes, or

abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile,
refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or
regulatory flood plain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water,

(12) Principal Use or Structure- means all uses or structures that are not
accessory uses or structures.
(13) Reach- a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of
a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment

have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to
occur on an average frequency in the magnitude ofthe 100-year recurrence interval. Regional

Elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood
plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a flood way.

the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel trailers/vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria

402.060 Flood Fringe District (FF).
A. Permitted Uses. Permitted Uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as
Permitted Uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use
districts exist, then any residential or non residential structure or use of a structure or land shall
be a Permitted Use in the Flood Fringe provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance.
All Permitted Uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe "Permitted Uses" listed in
Section 402.060 B and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Section 402.060 E.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so
that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen
( 15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a
minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside dimension at ground
level may be internally flood proofed in accordance with Section 402.050 D.5(c).
3. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
mie-thousand (1 ,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
Conditional Use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with
Section 402.060 B.l of this ordinance.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
5. The provisions of Section 402.060 E of this Ordinance shall apply.
C. Conditional Uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in
accordance with Section 402.060 B.1 and B.2 or any use of land that does not comply with the
standards in Section 402.060 B.3 and B.4 shall only be allowable as a Conditional Use. An
application for a Conditional Use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation
procedures specified in Sections 402.060 D and E and Section 402.110 D of this Ordinance.
D. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.
l. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to
elevate a structure's lowest floor above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. These
alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area
shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:
additional standards:
(a) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
(b) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
(c) it is used solely for-parking of vehicles, building access or storage.
The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
(d) Design and Certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as being in compliance with the general design standards
of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities must be at or above the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from
entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
(e) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas. Abovegrade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under
garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans
must stipulate:
(i) The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. When
openings are placed in a structure's walls to provide for
entry of flood waters to equalize pressures, the bottom of
all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters.
(ii) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4
classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used
solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
2. Basements, as defined by Section 402.030 (2) of this Ordinance, shall be
subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation provided the basement is structurally
dry flood proofed in accordance with Section 402.060 D.3 of this
Ordinance.
3. All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed
below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the
structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry flood
proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and
this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or
FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
4. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel
operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an
erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shore1and management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland
ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood
event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the
Governing Body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material
from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5. Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing
Body.
6. The provisions of Section 402.060 E of this Ordinance shall also apply.
E. Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.
1. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two (2) feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. If a
variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the
period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that
adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
2. Commercial Uses- accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and
parking lots may be at elevations lower than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not
be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if
the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities
greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
3. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood
durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in Section 402.060 E.2 above. In considering permit applications,
due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in flood plain areas.
4. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected
by the use ofriprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 1 00-year flood elevation -
FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested.
5. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity
of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a
floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
6. Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in Section
402.100 C.
7. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
402.070 General Flood Plain District.
A. Permissible Uses.
1. The uses listed in Section 402.050 A of this Ordinance shall be permitted
uses.
2. All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation
criteria pursuant to Section 402.070 B below. Section 402.050 shall apply if the proposed use is
in the Floodway District and Section 402.060 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood
Fringe District.
B. Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations Within the General Flood
Plain District.
1. Upon receipt of an application for a Conditional Use Permit for a use
within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the
following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination
of the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and whether the proposed use is within the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
(a) A typical valley cross-section showing the chmmel of the stream,
elevation ofland areas adjoining each side of the channel,
cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development,
and high water information.
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground;
pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations; size, location, and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the
site; location and elevations of streets; photographs showing
existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream; and
soil type.
(c) Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line
of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the
proposed development.
2. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to
determine the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota
Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000-6120.6200 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The
designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation
methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to
commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional i1ood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank
areas.
(c) Compute the flood way necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser
stage increase than 0.5 foot shall be required if, as a result of the
additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result.
An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream
within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
3. The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert to the Governing Body. The Governing Body must
formally accept the teclmical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe
District boundary or deny the permit application. The Governing Body, prior to official action,
may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Depmiment ofNatural Resources or the Planning Commission for
review and comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe Boundaries have been determined,
the Governing Body shall refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process
the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 402.050 and 402.060
of this Ordinance.
402.080 Subdivisions.
A. Land Suitability Review Criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the
reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots
within the flood plain districts shall contain a building site at or above the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision and to
the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe boundaries,
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be
clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
B. Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations in the General Flood Plain District. In the General
Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the information required in Section 402.070 B of this
Ordinance to determine the 1 00-year flood elevation, the Flood way and Flood Fringe District
boundaries and the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation for the subdivision site.
C. Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 1 00-year flood elevation.
FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested.
402.090 Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads and Bridges.
A. Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water
supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the
State Building Code or elevated to above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within
the flood plain shall comply with Sections 402.050 and 402.060 of this Ordinance. Elevation to
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of
these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads
may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services
would not endanger the public health or safety.
C. On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems. Where public utilities are not
provided:
1. On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
2. New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during
times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the State's current
statewide standards for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in
compliance with this Section.
402.100 Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Parks and Placement of
Travel Trailers and Travel Vehicles.
A. New Manufactured Home Parks. New manufactured home parks and expansions to
existing manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by
Section 402.080 of this Ordinance.

shall prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, in addition to those specified in Section
402.110 D. 6, which are in conformity with the purposes of this Ordinance. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the Conditional Use
Permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance punishable under Section
402.13 0. A copy of all decisions granting Conditional Use Permits shall be forwarded by mail to
the Commissioner ofNatural Resources within ten (10) days of such action.
3. Procedures to be followed by the Planning Commission in Passing on
Conditional Use Permit Applications Within all Flood Plain Districts.
(a) Require the applicant to furnish such of the following information
and additional information as deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission for determining the suitability of the particular site
for the proposed use:
(i) Plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevation of the lot, existing or
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
flood-proofing measures, and the relationship of the above
to the location of the stream channel.
(ii) Specifications for building construction and materials,
flood-proofing, filling, dredging, grading, channel
improvement, storage of materials, water supply and
sanitary facilities.
(b) Transmit one copy ofthe information described in subsection (a)
to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance, where necessary, in evaluating the proposed
project in relation to flood heights and velocities, the seriousness
of flood damage to the use, the adequacy of the plans for
protection, and other technical matters.
(c) Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or
expert, the Planning Commission shall determine the specific flood
hazard at the site and evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in
relation to the flood hazard.
4. Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Planning Commission Shall Be
Based. In passing upon Conditional Use applications, the Planning Commission shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this Ordinance, and:
(a) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others or they may block bridges,
culverts or other hydraulic structures.
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
(d) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(e) The importance ofthe services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
(g) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for the area.
G) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
(l) Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
Ordinance.
5. Time for Acting on Application. The Planning Commission shall act on
an application in the manner described above within 60 days from receiving the application,
except that where additional information is required pursuant to Section 402.110 D.4 of this
Ordinance. The Planning Commission shall render a written decision within 60 days from the
receipt of such additional information.
6. Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits. Upon consideration of
the factors listed above and the purpose of this Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall attach
such conditions to the granting of Conditional Use Permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the
purposes of this Ordinance; Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
402.120
(a) Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities.
(b) Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation.
(c) Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
(d) Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
compensatory storage, dikes, levees, and other protective
measures.
(e) Flood-proofing measures, in accordance with the State Building
Code and this Ordinance. The applicant shall submit a plan or
document certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the flood-proofing measures are consistent with the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and associated flood factors
for the particular area.
Nonconforming Uses.
A. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or
amendment ofthis Ordinance but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance may be continued subject to the following conditions:
1. No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
2. Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming
use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or use shall be
protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in accordance with any of the elevation
on fill or flood proofing techniques (i.e. FP-1 through FP-4 flood proofing classifications)
allowable in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in Section 402.120 A.3 below.
3. The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming
structure over the life ofthe structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations
and additions constructed since the adoption of the Community's initial flood plain controls must
be calculated into today's current cost which will include all costs such as construction materials
and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards of Section 402.050 or 402.060 of this
Ordinance for new structures depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or Flood
Fringe, respectively.
4. If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any ..
future use of the building premises shall conform to this Ordinance. The assessor shall notify the
Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of nonconforming uses which have been
discontinued for a period of 12 months.
5. If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including floods, to an extent of 50 percent or more of its market value at the time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. The
applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in Sections 402.050, 402.060 or
402.070 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the Floodway, Flood Fringe
or General Flood Plain District, respectively.
402.130 Penalties for Violation.
A. Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
grants of Variances or Conditional Uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable
as defined by law.
B. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City ofSt. Mary's Point from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedyany violation. Such actions may include
but are not limited to:
1. In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and Local Government may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available
to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders
for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood
insurance availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good faith to enforce these
official controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize
its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
2. When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the
attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate
the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon
as is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of
Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with the
Community's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
3. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this Ordinance and all other Official Controls and the nature and extent of the
suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or
development, the Zoning Administrator may order the construction or development immediately
halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the Community. If the construction or
development is already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
(a) issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made
within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls, or
(b) notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not
to exceed 30 days.
4. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the Zoning
Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute
an additional violation of this Ordinance and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning
Administrator shall also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to
restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the violation of this Ordinance.
402.140 Amendments.
The flood plain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be removed from flood plain
areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or
above the elevation of the regional flood and is contiguous to lands outside the flood plain.
Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner ofNatural Resources if he
determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
All amendments to this Ordinance, including amendments to the Official Zoning Map, must be
submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption.
Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
(FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before
adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given 1 0-days written notice of all
hearings to consider an amendment to this Ordinance and said notice shall include a draft of the
ordinance amendment or technical study under consideration."
Section 3. Effective Date. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and
after its passage and publication according to law.
Passed and adopted by the City Council of the City of St. Mary's Point, Washington
County, Minnesota, on this 3rd day of September, 2002.

RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED
JAN I 3 1987
Mr. Thomas Lutgen
Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources
500 Fayette Road
St. Paul, Minnesota 55146
Dear Mr. Lutgen:
This is in regard to the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the U~incorporated
Areas of Washington County, Minnesota, and the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs} for the Cities of Afton, Bayport, Lake St. Croix Beach, Lakeland,
Lakeland Shores, and st. Mary's Point, Minnesota. The 100-year flood
elevations shown for the St. Croix River in the currently effective FIS for
the county do not match those shown for the river on the currently effective
FIRMs for the' cities. We wish to inform you of the measures being taken to
resolve these mismatches.
The FIS for Washington County, which was published on May 17, 1982, presents
the most accurate and up-to-date 100-year flood elevations for the st. Croix
River. These elevations are lower than those presented on the FIRMs for the
cities. Enclosed with this letter is a copy of the 100-year flood profile for
the st. Croix River as shown in the published FIS for Washington County. The
100-year flood elevations shown on the FIRMs for the cities have been plotted
on this profile to show the magnitude of the differences.
The differences between the 100-year flood elevations shown in the FIS for the
county and those shown on the FIRMs for the Cities of Afton and St. Mary s
Point are less than .5 foot; therefore, no revisions to the effective FIRMs
for these cities are warranted. If revisions become- necessary for other
reasons, the FIRMs for the cities will be updated to reflect the 100-year
flood elevations shown on the flood profiles in the FIS for the county.
The differences between the 100-year flood elevations shown in the FIS for the
county and those shown on the FIRMs for the Cities of Bayport, Lake st. Croix
Beach, Lakeland, and Lakeland Shores are greater than 1 foot; therefore, we
have informed our Chicago Regional Office that the FIRMs for these cities will
be revised by Letters of Map Revision in the near future.

SECTION 3. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION & FINDINGS OF FACT
301. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of
Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 104, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to minimize flood losses.
302. Findings of Fact.
302.01. The flood hazard areas of the unincorporated areas of
Washington County, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation
which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
302.02. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance
is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is
consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources.

SECTION 4. DEFINITIONS
401. Rules
401.01. In the event of conflicting provisions in the text of
this Ordinance, the more restrictive provision shall apply. The
County Zoning Administrator shall rule on what is more "restrictive"
and appeals from said decisions may be made in a manner provided.
401.02. Words used in the present tense include the past and
future tense; the singular number includes the plural and the plural
includes the singular; the word "shall" is mandatory, and the word
"may" is permissive.
402. Definitions.
402.01. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same
meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this Ordinance
its most reasonable application.
(1) Accessory Use or Structure. A use or structure on the
same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental
and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
(2) Basement. Any area of a structure, including crawl
spaces, having its floor or base sub-grade (below
ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the
depth of excavation below ground level.
(3) Conditional Use. A specific type of structure or land
use listed in the official control that may be allowed
but only after an in-depth review procedure and with
appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in
the official zoning controls or building codes and upon
a finding that: (1) certain conditions as detailed in
the zoning ordinance exist and (2) the structure and/or
land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if
one exists and are compatible with the existing
neighborhood.
(4) Equal Degree of Encroachment. A method of determining
the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain
lands on both sides of a stream are capable of
conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
(5) Flood. A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a
stream or in the stage of a lake that results in the
inundation of normally dry areas.
- 3 -
(6) Flood Frequency. The average frequency, statistically
determined, for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equalled or exceeded.
(7) Flood Fringe. That portion of the floodplain outside
of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the
term "Floodway Fringe" used in the Flood Insurance
Study for Washington County.
(8) Floodplain. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered
by the regional flood.
(9) Floodproofing. A combination of structural provisions,
changes, or adjustments to properties and structures
subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or
elimination of flood damages.
(10) Floodway. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel
of the watercourse and those portions of the adjoining
floodplain which are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the regional flood.
(11) Obstruction. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee,
dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel
modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in,
along, across, or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water,
either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water.
(12) Normal Ordinary High Water Mark. A mark delineating
the highest water level which has been maintained for a
sufficient period of time to leave evidence upon the
landscape. The ordinary high water mark is commonly
that point where the natural vegetation changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial.
(13) Principal Use or Structure. All uses or structures
that are not accessory uses or structures.
(14) Reach. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a
longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by
a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area,
the segment of a stream or river between two
consecutive bridge crossings would most typically
constitute a r~ach.
(15) Regional Flood. A flood which is representative of
large floods known to have occurred generally in
- 4 -
Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the
magnitude of the 100 year recurrence interval.
Regional flood is synonymous with the term "Base Flood"
used in the Flood Insurance Study.
(16) Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation shall be an elevation no
lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional
flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachment on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.

development standard required in an official control
including this ordinance to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the
official control, but only as applied to a particular
property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship,
practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined
and elaborated upon in the Washington County Zoning
Ordinance.

SECTION 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS
501. Application of this Ordinance.
501.01. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this
Ordinance are either more restrictive or less restrictive than
comparable conditions imposed by any of the other Chapters of the
Washington County Development Code or by any other law, ordinance,
statute, resolution, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which
are more restrictive, or which impose higher standards or
requirements shall prevail.
501.02. The provisions of this Ordinance are in addition to,
rather than in lieu of, regulations imposed by Chapter 1, Zoning
Ordinance and Chapter 2, Shoreland Management Ordinance, of the
County Development Code for Washington County, Minnesota.
501.03. Lands to which ordinance applies. This Ordinance shall
apply to all lands within the unincorporated areas of Washington
County shown on the Official Zoning Map as being located within the
boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain
Districts.
501.04. Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The Official
Zoning Map, together with all materials attached thereto, is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.
The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the
unincorporated areas of Washington County prepared by the Federal
Insurance Administration dated May 17, 1982, and the Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps therein. The
Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the office of the County
Auditor and the Washington County Zoning Administrator.
501.05. Regulatory flood protection elevation. The Regulatory
Flood Protection Elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one
foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachment on the floodplain that result
from designation of a floodway.
501.06. Interpretation.
(1) In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this Ordinance shall be held to be the minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor
of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by
State Statutes.
(2) The boundaries of the zoning district shall be
determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning
Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
- 6 -
location of the boundaries of the district as shown on
the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions, the Planning Commission shall
make the necessary interpretation based on available
technical data. Persons contesting the location of the
district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the Planning
Commission and to submit technical evidence.
501.07. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be
used, and no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this
Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.
501.08. Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended
by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall prevail.
501.09. Warning and disclaimer of liability. This Ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land
uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part
of Washington County or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
501.10. Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or
portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance
shall not be affected thereby.

those areas designated as floodway on the Flood
Boundary Floodway Maps and/or as established by
elevations delineated by the Federal Emergency
Management Administration.
(2) Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District shall
include those areas designated as floodway fringe on
the Flood Boundary Floodway Maps.
(3) General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain
District shall include those areas designated as
unnumbered A Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
The boundaries of these districts shall be shown on the Official
Zoning Map. Within these districts all uses not allowed as permitted
uses or permissible as conditional uses shall be prohibited.
602. Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be
used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this
Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. Within the Floodway, Flood
Fringe and General Floodplain Districts, all uses not listed as
permitted uses or conditional uses in Sections 7, 8 and 9 that
follow, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is
provided here that:
602.01. New manufactured homes and replacement manufactured
homes are subject to the general provisions of this Ordinance and

repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and
nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general
provisions of this Ordinance and specifically Section 14.
602.03. As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed
structures must be certified by ground surveys and floodproofing
techniques must be designed and certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect as specified in the general
provisions of this Ordinance and specifically as stated in Section 13
of this Ordinance.
- 8 -
SECTION 7. FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW)
701. Permitted Uses.
701.01. The following uses have a low flood damage potential and
do not obstruct flood flows. These uses shall be permitted within
the Floodway District to the extent that they are not prohibited by
any other ordinance and provided they do not require structures,
fill, or storage of materials or equipment. In addition, no use
shall adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways or
any tributary to the main stream or of any drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system.
(1) Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture,
grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck
farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop
harvesting.
(2) Industrial-Commercial uses such as loading areas,
parking areas, and airport landing strips.
(3) Private and public golf courses, tennis courts, driving
ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching
ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature
preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting
preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges,
hunting and fishing areas, and single or multiple
purpose recreational trails.
(4) Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play
areas.
702. Conditional Uses.
702.01. The following uses are allowed following the issuance of
a Conditional Use Permit provided they are also permitted uses in the
Washington County Zoning Ordinance.
(1) Structures accessory to uses listed in 701.01 above and
uses listed in 702.02 through 702.08.
(2) Placement of fill.

(7) Other uses similar in nature to uses described in
Sections 701 and 702 which are consistent with the
intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
(8) Structural works for flood control such as levees,
dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where
the intent is to protect individual structures and
agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to
or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
703. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses.
703.01. All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill
(including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage
of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a
conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the
100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in
the reach or reaches affected.
703.02. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the
procedures and standards contained in Section 1303 of this Ordinance
and Section 505 of Chapter 1, Washington County Development Code.
703.03. The conditional use shall be permissible in the
underlying zoning district if one exists.
703.04. Fill.
(1) Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials
deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be
protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching,
rip rap or other acceptable method.
(2) Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall
not be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site
development plan is submitted which includes an
erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
(3) As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (2)
immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and
gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage
of fill or other materials which would have caused an
increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood
but only after the Washington County has received an
appropriate plan which assures the removal of the
materials from the floodway based upon the flood
warning time available. The conditional use permit
must be title registered with the property in the
Office of the County Recorder.
- 10 -
703.05. Accessory structures (temporary or permanent) permitted
as conditional uses by Section 702.01 (1) and Chapter 1 of the
Washington County Development Code.
(1) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
(2) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be
constructed and placed on the building site so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of
floodwaters.
(a) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed
with the longitudinal axis parallel to the
direction of flood flow, and
(b) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as
those of adjoining structures.
(3) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or
structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the
FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4
floodproofing classification in the State Building Code
provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size,
and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be
used solely for parking of vehicles and limited
storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must
meet the following additional standards, as
appropriate:
(a) The structure must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of
the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and
(b) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a
structure must be elevated to or above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or properly
floodproofed.
703.06. ·Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in
time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially
injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited.
- 11 -
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed
if readily removable from the area within the time
available after a flood warning and in accordance with
a plan approved by the Zoning Administrator.
703.07. Structural works for flood control that will change the
course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public
waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute,
Chapter 105. Community-wide structural works for flood control
intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be
allowed in the floodway.
703.08. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway
~hall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the
technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on
both sides of a stream.
- 12 -
SECTION 8. FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
801. Permitted Uses.
801.01. The following uses shall be permitted uses within the
Flood Fringe District to the extent that they are not prohibited by
any other ordinance:
(1) Any uses permitted in Section 701.
(2) Accessory structures provided they comply with the
provisions of Section 703.03 of this Ordinance and the
Washington County Zoning Ordinance.
(3) Residences and other structures constructed on fill so
that the basement floor or first floor, if there is no
basement, is at or above the Regulatory Flood
Protection elevation. The finished fill elevation
shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and shall extend
at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the
limits of any structure or building erected thereon.
Fill shall be compacted and the slopes shall be
protected by rip rap or vegetative covering.
Residences constructed on fill shall be subject to the
vehicular access requirements in Section 804.01.
(4) As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory
structures that constitute a minimal investment and
that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside
dimension at ground level may be internally
floodproofed in accordance with Section 703.05 (3).
801.02. No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect
the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, or of any drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility
or system.
801.03. The placement of fill where a cumulative total of
one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is proposed to be located on
the parcel shall require a conditional use permit, unless said fill
is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with
Section 801.01 (3) of this Ordinance.
801.04. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be
elevated on fill to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
802. Conditional Uses.
802.01. Any strticture that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with Section 801.01 (3) or any use of land
that does not comply with the standards in Sections 801.03 and 801.04
- 13 -
shall only be allowed as a conditional use. An application for a
conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in Sections 803, 804 and 1303 of this
Ordinance, and Section 505 of Chapter 1 of the Washington County
Development Code.
803. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.
803.01. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill
may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. These alternative methods may
include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or
above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under
garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered
above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:
1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure; 2) is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and 3) is used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative
elevation methods are subject to the following standards:
(1) Design and Certification - The structure's design and
as-built condition must be certified by a registered
professional engineer of architect as being in
compliance with the general design standards of the
State Building Code and, specifically, that all
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities
must be at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from
entering or accumulating within these components during
times of flooding.
(2) Specific Standards for ·Above-Grade, Enclosed Areas -
Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces
or tuck under garages must be designed to internally
flood and design plans must stipulate:
(a) The minimum area of openings in the walls where
internal fldoding is to be used as a floodproofing
technique. When openings are placed in a
structure's walls to provide for entry of
floodwaters to equalize pressures, the bottom of
all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
(b) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood
resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or
FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code
- 14 -
and shall be used solely for building access,
parking of vehicles or storige.
803.02. Basements, as defined by Section 402.01 (2) of this
Ordinance, shall be subject to the following:
(1) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed
below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.
(2) Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation provided the
basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance
with Section 803.03 of this Ordinance.
803.03. All areas of nonresidential structures including
basements to be placed below the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally
dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code.
Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 and FP-2
floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and this
shall require making the structure watertight with the walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed
to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
803.04. The placement of fill where a cumulative total of
one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is proposed to be located on
the parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand
and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or
construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control
plan must be submitted. The plan must clearly specify methods to be
used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of
the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified
individual acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. The plan may
incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from
the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
803.05. Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in
time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially
injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited.
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed
if readily removable from the area within the time
available after a flood warning and in accordance with
a plan approved by the Zoning Administrator.
803.06. The provisions of Section 804 of this Ordinance shall
also apply.
- 15 -
804. Standards for Flood Fringe Uses.
804.01. All new principal structures must have vehicular access
at or above an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. If a variance to this
requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify
limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for
times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
804.02. Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards,
railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. However, a permit for such
facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall
not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides
for adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a
depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater
than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
804.03. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be
taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations
especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain
accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower
elevations subject to requirements set out in Section 804.02 above.
In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given
to needs to an industry whose business requires that it be located in
floodplain areas.
804.04. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of rip rap, vegetative cover or other
acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above
the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be
investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change
of special flood hazard area designation is requested.
804.05. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the
hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other
encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.

Permit for a use within the General Floodplain District, the
applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following
information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for
the determination of the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and
whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe
District.
(1) A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of
the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side
of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by
the proposed development, and high water information.
(2) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of
the ground; pertinent structure, fill, or storage
elevations; size, location, and spatial arrangement of
all proposed and existing structures on the site;
location and elevations of streets; photographs showing

which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance may
be continued subject to the following conditions:
(1) No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or
altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
(2) Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure
or nonconforming use which would result in increasing
the flood damage potential of that structure or use
shall be protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation in accordance with any of the elevations on
fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 through
FP-4, Floodproofing Classifications) allowable in the
State Building Code, except as further restricted in
(3) below.
(3) The cost of any structural alterations or additions to
any nonconforming structure over the life of the
structure shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
assessed market value of the structure excluding the
land value unless the conditions of this Section are
satisfied. (The assessed market value is the market
value of the structure in the Offices of the Washington
County Assessor for the year in which applic~tion for
the building permit is made), The cost of all
structural alterations and additions constructed since
the adoption of the Community's initial floodplain
controls must be calculated into today's current cost
which will include all costs such as construction
materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower
and labor. If the current cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the current market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards
of Section 7 or 8 of this Ordinance for new structures,
depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe, respectively.
(4) If any nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve
(12) consecutive months, any future use of the building
premises shall conform to this Ordinance. The assessor

percent (50%) or more of its market value at the time
of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. The
applicable provisions for establishing new uses or
structures in Sections 7, 8 or 9 will apply depending
upon whether the use or structure is in the Floodway,
Flood Fringe or General Floodplain District,
respectively.

1101 LICENSING AND REGULATING THE
RETAIL SALE OF CIGARETTES
1101.010. Purpose
Because the City recognizes that many persons under the age of eighteen (18) years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco related
devices, and because studies, which the City hereby accepts and adopts1
, have shown that most
smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of eighteen (18) years and that those
persons who reach the age of eighteen (18) years without having started smoking are significantly
less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several
serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government;
this Ordinance shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco
products, and tobacco related devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to
protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco
products, and tobacco related devices, and to further the official public policy of the State of
Minnesota in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat.

1102 PROVIDING FOR SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE
PROCESSING OF ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATIONS REGARDING
CITY-ISSUED LICENSES AND PERMITS
Findings and Purpose
The City of St. Mary's Point regulates many types of activities. For many of these
activities, the City issues licenses or permits. Licenses or permits are issued for those activities
which have the most profound effect (or potential effect) upon the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens. For example, licenses and permits are issued for bars and retail liquor establishments,
junkyards, the sale of cigarettes, the operation of mining pits, and other special uses of property
which require the City Council to be particularly aware ofthe activities being conducted.
From time to time, the City is also called upon to determine if the holder of a license
or a permit has violated the terms of that license or permit. Similarly, there are sometimes
allegations that the license or permit holder has violated a statute, ordinance or rule which also
regulates the proper operation of that activity.
Current City Ordinances do not adequately establish a uniform procedure for the
City to determine if a violation has occurred. Ordinances also do not adequately delineate what
remedies are available to the City to insure that licenses and permits are properly followed in the
future so as to adequately protect the health, safety and welfare ofthe City's residents.
This Ordinance is designed to establish a uniform method of determining whether or
not violations have occurred. It is the intent of the City Council to establish a system which would
provide fair and adequate notice to the permit/license holder ofthe alleged violation and a hearing
before the City Council. The possible penalties which are provided for are designed to protect the
public from future violations. Specifically, the sanctions should deter a violator from engaging in
future violations and should serve as a warning to other individuals engaged in the same types of
activities that the City Council will respond appropriately to proven violations.
1102.020 I jcenses and Permits
The terms of this Ordinance shall apply to all licenses and permits (of any kind)
issued by the City of St. Mary's Point.
1102.030 Hearing Requirements
A. All hearings as envisioned within this Ordinance shall take place before the
219
City Council at the City Council Chambers or at such other place as is convenient and proper, given
the nature ofthe matter under consideration.
B. None ofthe civil sanctions authorized herein shall be imposed by the City
Council until the license/permit holder has been given an opportunity for a hearing before the City
Council.
C. Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions found within
Minnesota's Administrative Procedure Act (M.S. §14.57 to §14.69).
D. This Ordinance does not require the City of St. Mary's Point to conduct its
hearing before an employee ofthe Office of Administrative Hearings. Rather, it is intended that
hearings will take place before the City Council.
1102.040 Civil Sanctions
If the City Council finds that a license or permit holder has failed to comply with
their license or permit, or has failed to comply with any applicable statute, rule or ordinance related
to the operation of the activity for which a license or permit has been granted by the City, then the
City Council may revoke the license or permit, suspend the license or permit for a period of up to
sixty (60) days, impose a civil penalty of up to Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars for each
violation, or impose any combination ofthese sanctions.
1102.050 Payment ofFines
A. If the Council imposes a civil fine, the Council shall also allow the
license/permit holder a reasonable time to pay the fine. A "reasonable time to pay" means that all
fines shall be paid within sixty (60) days unless the Council determines that a longer period of time
is justified under the circumstances of the case.
B. Failure of a license/permit holder to pay a fine within sixty ( 60) days (or
within the time otherwise allowed by the Council) shall cause that license or permit to become
immediately suspended until full payment is received by the City Clerk.
. ll02.060 Revocation or Suspension
Any license/permit holder who has had their license or permit suspended or revoked
pursuant to any of the terms of this Ordinance, shall not be allowed to operate the activity which
required the license or permit until the license or permit is reinstated. Any operation during a
period of suspension or revocation shall be deemed to be an additional violation of the terms of the
220
permit or license.
1102.070 Constitutionality
If any portion of this Ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional,
such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision, and such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
