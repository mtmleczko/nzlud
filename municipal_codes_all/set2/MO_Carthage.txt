PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Carthage of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the first section of Chapter 2 is 2-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-2 and 1-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-2.1, 1-2.2 and 1-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully maintaining this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Tom Simpson, City Administrator, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 1-8-02) 
Sec. 6-435. - Naming process. 
(a)  At the time parkland or a facility is acquired but before development occurs, the city will assign a nondescript temporary working name for the area or facility. 
(b)  Once the development is initiated, the public services committee will receive naming applications for review by the committee. 
(c)  After a name is decided upon by the public services committee, public notice of the recommended qualifying name will occur once during a thirty (30) day period in the city's official newspaper. Citizen comments and recommendations must be in writing to the public services committee and be postmarked within the thirty (30) day public notice period. 
(d)  For an individual (excluding historically significant individuals) to be considered, that person must have contributed significantly to the acquisition or development of the park or facility or to the city overall. The recommended name must be accompanied by a biographical sketch which shall provide evidence of contributions to the park, facility, or city overall. 
(e)  After the thirty (30) day public notice period, the public services committee will submit the recommended name to the city council for final approval. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 1-8-02) 
Sec. 6-436. - Renaming. 
(a)  The renaming of parks, public buildings, structures, facilities, and streets is strongly discouraged. It is recommended that efforts to change a name be subject to the most critical examination so as not to diminish the original justification for the name or discount the value of the prior contributors. 
(b)  Only those parks, public buildings, structures, facilities, and streets named for geographic location, outstanding feature or subdivision should be considered for renaming. Parks named by deed restriction cannot be considered for renaming. 
(c)  Public buildings, structures, facilities, and streets named after individuals should never be changed unless it is found that the individual's personal character is or was such that the continued use of their name for a park or facility would not be in the best interest of the city. 
(d)  In order for public buildings, structures, facilities, and streets to be considered for renaming, the following must occur: 
The recommended name must qualify according to this policy, and; be accompanied by a petition from the particular public park, facility, or street users.

(Ord. No. 02-02, § I, 1-8-02) 
Sec. 6-438. - Plaques, markers, memorials. 
 All plaques, markers, and memorials are subject to the same naming criteria in this policy. 
 Because of their proneness to vandalism and maintenance, plaques, markers, and memorials should be used sparingly. 
 The public services committee, subject to approval by the city council, establishes the style, size, and placement of all plaques, markers, signs, and memorials. 
 It is anticipated that certain signs or markers such as city limit signs may display names to bring attention to current or former Carthage residents. These names will be considered as transient and subject to rotation at the discretion of the city council, as recommended by the public services committee.

Sec. 17-58. - Procedure for hearings upon applications for certificates of appropriateness. 
(a)  Determination by planning, zoning and historic preservation commission. The planning, zoning and historic preservation commission shall review the application for a building or demolition permit or for a certificate of appropriateness and issue or deny the certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the application. Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be provided the applicant and the city engineering department within seven (7) days following the determination and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness in the case of an approval. 
    A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six (6) months of the day it is issued. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of eighteen (18) months and are renewable. If the project is not completed as shown on the certificate of appropriateness, the project shall be deemed in violation of this section. 
(b)  Denial of a certificate of appropriateness. A denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the denial. The planning, zoning and historic, preservation commission shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission to reconsider its denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the differences between the owner and the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission. The applicant may resubmit an amended application or reapply for a building or demolition permit that takes into consideration the recommendations of the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission. 
(c)  Procedure for appeal. A determination by the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission that a certificate of appropriateness be denied may be appealed to the city council. The applicant may within thirty (30) days after the date of the denial file with the city clerk a written appeal to the city council. The council shall than set a hearing date not more than thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of appeal. In considering the appeal, the city council shall consider whether the planning, zoning and historical preservation commission appropriately followed the guidelines set forth by ordinance for the consideration of a certificate of appropriateness. 
    A determination by the city council that the appeal is denied shall be the final administrative decision reviewable under the Missouri Administrative Procedure and Review Act, and any appeal from this denial shall be to the circuit court as provided therein. 
(d)  Standards for review. In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a certificate or appropriateness, the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to any design guidelines in the ordinance designating the landmark of historic district. 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
(2)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature shall be avoided when possible. 
(3)  All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(4)  Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(7)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(8)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(9)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
(e)  Certificate of economic hardship. Application for a certificate of economic hardship shall be made on a form prepared by the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission only after a certificate of appropriateness has been denied. The planning, zoning and historic preservation commission shall schedule a public hearing concerning the application in the same manner as provided for hearing application for certificate of appropriateness. 
    The planning, zoning and historic preservation commission may solicit expert testimony or require that the applicant for a certificate of economic hardship make submissions concerning any or all of the following information before it makes its determination on the application: 
(1)  Estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. 
(2)  A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation. 
(3)  Estimated market value of the property in its current condition; after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition or removal; after any changes recommended by the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission; and in the case of a proposed demolition, after renovation of the existing property for continued use. 
(4)  In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility for rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. 
(5)  Amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased, including a description of their relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer. 
(6)  If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two (2) years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two (2) years; and depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period. 
(7)  Remaining balances on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two (2) years. 
(8)  All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing, or ownership of the property. 
(9)  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any, within the previous two (2) years. 
(10)  Assessed value of the property according to the two (2) most recent assessments. 
(11)  Real estate taxes for the previous two (2) years. 
(12)  Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for-profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, or other. 
(13)  Any other information, including personal financial information of the owner, applicant, or principal investors in the property considered necessary by the planning, zoning and historic preservation commission to a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owners. 
(f)  Determination of economic hardship. The planning, zoning and historic preservation commission shall review all of the evidence and information required of an applicant for a certificate of economic hardship. It shall make a determination within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the application whether the denial of a certificate of appropriateness has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. This determination may be used in a resubmission request for a certificate of appropriateness. The determination of economic hardship will not guarantee the granting of a certificate of appropriateness. Rather, it will serve as added supportive documentation for the request. Written notice of the determination shall be provided in the same manner as stated above. 
    A finding of economic hardship may not be granted unless the applicant has, for a period of six (6) months, made a good-faith effort to sell such structure at or below fair market value to an entity which gives reasonable assurance of its willingness to preserve or restore such structure. Fair market value shall be that price arrived at between a seller willing to sell and a purchaser desiring to buy. A good-faith effort to sell shall be found by the commission when it has determined that the applicant has made an active effort to sell said property by listing it for sale with a real estate broker and in a multi-list system located within the city at a price not more than ten (10) percent above the fair market value as established by an appraiser. During this six-month period, a "For Sale" sign, as placed there by the real estate broker, must be visible on the property at all times. The certificate shall not be issued or may be revoked if it is proven that the applicant refused to sell to a buyer whose intention was to restore or preserve the structure, at fair market value or for a price at which the applicant has offered it to others whose intention was to demolish or remove the structure. The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness may be suspended while any condemnation proceedings are pending. 
(g)  Appeals. A determination by the planning, zoning, and historic preservation commission that an application for a certificate of economic hardship be denied shall be appealable to the city council as and like in the same manner as a denial of a certificate of appropriateness.

ARTICLE VI. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE[4] 
Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 04-39, Arts. 1-7, adopted Aug. 10, 2004 did not specify manner of codification, hence; inclusion of these provisions as Art. VI, §§ 17-101-17-103, 17-121-17-127, 17-141-17-144, 17-161-17-165, 17-171-17-176, 17-191, 17-211 was at the discretion of the editor. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 17-101. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 89.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of City of Carthage, Missouri ordains as follows. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 1, § A, 8-10-2004) 
Sec. 17-102. - Findings of fact. 
1.  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Carthage, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
3.  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
a.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one (1) percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Jasper County dated November 2, 2012 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
b.  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
c.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point. 
d.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
e.  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 1, § B, 8-10-2004; Ord. No. 06-13, § I, 2-28-2006; Ord. No. 07-12, § 1, 3-13-2006; Ord. No. 12-35, § I, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 17-103. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 17-102(1); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this article to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
3.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 2, § C, 8-10-2004) 
Sec. 17-124. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 2, § D, 8-10-2004) 
Sec. 17-125. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 2, § E, 8-10-2004) 
Sec. 17-126. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create a liability on the part of city, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, Art. 2, § F, 8-10-2004)

Sec. 17-164. - Floodway. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 17-121 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
2.  The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial-improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.  If subsection 2. of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
4.  In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in section 17-161(2).

    In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria: 
1.  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
2.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and,

1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 2 through 6 below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Sec. 17-176. - Conditions for approving variances for agricultural structures. 
    Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in division 5, sections 17-174 and 17-175 of this article. 
    In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed. 
1.  All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management regulations of this article shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures. 
2.  Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
3.  For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with section 17-161(4)b. 
4.  The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with section 17-161(4)a. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
5.  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 17-161(4)d. 
6.  The agricultural structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with section 17-162(1)c. 
7.  Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
8.  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the agricultural structures. 
9.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
10.  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 22-51. - Streets. 
(a)  Unless otherwise approved by the commission, provision must be made for the extension of main thoroughfares, as shown on the major street plan of the commission; and 
secondary streets must provide free circulation within the subdivisions. Off-center street intersections will not be approved except in unusual cases. 
(b)  The system of streets designated for the subdivision, except in unusual cases, must connect with streets already dedicated in adjacent subdivisions, and where no adjacent connections are platted, must in general be the reasonable projection of streets in nearest subdivided tracts, and must be continued to the boundaries of the tract subdivided, so that other subdivisions may connect therewith. 
(c)  Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided to connect with future streets in adjacent land, but courts or "places" may be permitted where the form or contour of the land makes it difficult to plat with connecting streets. Such courts or "places" shall provide proper access to all lots and shall generally not exceed four hundred (400) feet in length, and a turnaround shall be provided at the closed end, with an outside radius of at least fifty (50) feet. 
(d)  In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets or customary subdivision practices in the neighborhood. Where no existing plats control, the blocks shall generally not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet in length, except that in outlining subdivisions a greater length may be permitted where topography or other conditions, in the opinion of the council and commission, justify such lengths. In blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrian ways through the block may be required near the center of the block. Such business use shall generally not exceed six hundred (600) feet. 
(e)  Width of major streets must be approved by the commission or if a major street plan is adopted by the commission such streets shall conform to such plan. A building line safeguarding future widening, may be required by the council or commission in lieu of dedication of the indicated width. Dedication of a half street adjoining unplatted property will be accepted. No reserve strips will be permitted unless by special approval of the council and commission. 
(f)  In districts where apartments or business buildings are apt to be built in the future, or where there is through traffic, minor streets shall be at least sixty (60) feet in width. In districts where detached residences are allowed minor streets shall be at least fifty (50) feet in width. 
(g)  Except in unusual cases, alleys or loading courts shall be provided in business blocks. Alleys are optional in residential districts. Alleys shall have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet. In case of intersecting alleys a cut-off shall be required of at least five (5) feet measured from the point of intersection of the alley lines, the resultant connecting lot line to be at least five (5) feet in length. 
(h)  The streets shall so be laid out as to correspond with the prolongations of existing streets, as far as practicable.

(Code 1978, § 420.050(C)) 
Sec. 22-54. - Lot lines. 
    All rectangular lots and all other lots, so far as practicable, shall have the side lines at right angles to the street on which the lot faces, or radial to curbed street lines. Lots with double frontage are undesirable, and shall be avoided wherever possible. 
(Code 1978, § 420.050(J)) 
Sec. 22-55. - Utility easements. 
    Where alleys are not included in the plat, easements of not less than five (5) feet shall be provided on each side of rear or side lot lines, where required by the council or commission, for public utilities, if necessary for the extension of main water or sewer lines, or similar utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots. Easements shall connect with established easements in adjoining property. 
(Code 1978, § 420.050(K)) 
Sec. 22-56. - Building lines. 
    Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for residential use, and may be required on lots intended for business use, and shall provide at least the setback required by the zoning ordinance. 
(Code 1978, § 420.050(L)) 
Sec. 22-57. - Parks, schools, sites and playgrounds. 
    Suitable sites for parks, schools, playgrounds or other public requirements shall be indicated on the preliminary plat, so that it can be determined which of such sites should be indicated on the final plat, and when and in what manner such areas will be acquired by the city.

(Code 1978, § 420.070) 
Sec. 22-77. - Staged installation. 
    The subdivider may, at his election, make required improvements on a progressive basis, but in no instance shall a building permit be issued for construction prior to installation and approval of minimum requirements in any block of the subdivision. 
(Code 1978, § 420.070) 
Sec. 22-78. - Bond. 
    The council may accept bond in an amount sufficient to ensure minimum improvements will be installed prior to erection of structures on any block in the subdivision. 
(Code 1978, § 420.070) 
Sec. 22-79. - Streets and alleys. 
(a)  New streets and alleys in the subdivision shall be graded and paved. Specifications for the paving will be furnished by the city street department, public works department or the city's contract engineering firm. 
(b)  Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets, except where the construction of a sidewalk along one (1) side of a cul-de-sac with less than four (4) homes may be allowed to provided that each home has direct access to the sidewalk. Sidewalks may also be required elsewhere where deemed to be in the interest of public safety. 
(c)  Unless otherwise required or permitted, sidewalks shall be placed in the street right-of-way and located approximately one (1) foot from and parallel to the edge of the right-of-way. 
(d)  Where sufficient foot traffic will be realized across proposed streets to merit a crosswalk and/or pedestrian signal, the installation of such signals or striping of the street to provide for the safety of pedestrians may be required. 
(e)  An internalized pedestrian circulation system in the form of paved walking paths or jogging trails may be substituted in whole or part for sidewalks along residential streets with approval from the public works department and the planning and zoning commission.

(Code 1978, § 420.070(3)) 
Sec. 22-82. - City participation in cost of certain improvements. 
(a)  The city shall reimburse, subject to the availability of funds, the developer of a platted subdivision of land for the cost of all concrete curbs and gutters which have been installed along streets which have been constructed in accordance with the City Code. The same would apply to any existing subdivision where the platted street has not yet been graded, and all of the platted lots are owned by the developer. The proposed plans for the expenditure must be submitted to the city for approval prior to construction. 
(b)  The developer is required to construct the sanitary sewers, water mains, electric lines, and street improvements prior to making any reimbursement to the developer for the concrete curbs and gutters. 
(c)  The city shall, subject to the availability of funds, install sanitary sewers, water mains, and electric lines if requested by the developer, and shall assess the cost to each lot. The cost of the improvements shall be payable in ten (10) equal annual installments bearing interest at eight (8) percent per annum. 
(d)  The developer would reimburse the city the amount of the sewer, water, and electric assessment against any lot, whenever the lot is sold, leased, or otherwise conveyed to another party. 
(e)  The developer shall execute a note acceptable to the city, assuring the city that the special assessments would be paid. 
(f)  The city, at its discretion, and where financially feasible, shall extend sanitary sewers and water mains to existing vacant lots under separate ownership within the city and shall allocate the costs to the benefitting properties. The charges against the undeveloped properties would be interest-free, and would be due and payable upon connection to the city utility. Properties already improved with a well or a septic tank shall also be assessed, but shall pay their share of the utility extension, at such time that a permit is issued for connection to the city utility. 
(g)  The city shall be responsible for the construction and the cost of any pumping stations and force mains required within its sanitary sewer systems.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 22-101. - Introduction. 
    On January 24, 1989, the city council adopted Ordinance No. 6162 which provided for the construction of municipal improvements and the payment thereof, in accordance with policies and procedures to be approved by the city council prior to the ordinance becoming effective. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
Sec. 22-102. - Provisions of Ordinance No. 6162. 
    Ordinance No. 6162 provides for the following commitments by the city subject to final approval of each project by the city council: 
(1)  The city will reimburse the developer of a platted subdivision of land for the cost of all concrete curbs and gutters which have been constructed along streets in accordance with the City Code. The same applies to any existing subdivision where the platted street right of way has not been improved, and all of the platted lots are owned by the developer. The proposed expenditure for curb and gutter construction must be submitted to the city for approval and commitment prior to construction. 
(2)  The developer is required to construct the sanitary sewers, water mains, electric lines, and street improvements before the city makes its reimbursement to the developer for the concrete curbs and gutters. 
(3)  The city agrees to finance the installation of sanitary sewers, water mains, and electric lines if requested by the developer, and assess the cost to each lot. Principal and interest payments would be spread over a period of ten (10) years at an interest rate of eight (8) percent. The city reserves the right to limit its participation in any project. 
(4)  The developer will reimburse the city the amounts of the sewer, water, and electric assessments against any lot, whenever the lot is sold, leased or otherwise involves another party. 
(5)  The developer will furnish a form of guarantee, acceptable to the city, assuring the city that the special assessments will be paid. 
(6)  The city, upon request, and at its discretion, will extend sanitary sewers and/or water mains to existing vacant lots under separate ownership within the city, and will allocate the costs to the benefiting properties. Such charges allocated to the undeveloped properties, including interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum, would be due and payable upon connection to the utility. Properties already improved with a well and/or septic tank will also be charged in the same manner, and will pay their share of the cost of the utility extension, at such time that a permit is issued for connection to the utility. 
(7)  The city will be responsible for the construction and the cost of any pumping stations and force mains required within its sanitary sewer system. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
DIVISION 2. - APPLICABLE PROJECTS 

Sec. 22-103. - Criteria for eligibility. 
    In accordance with Ordinance No. 6162, eligible projects must satisfy the following criteria: 
(1)  Must be a platted subdivision of land, comprised of residential lots. 
(2)  The residential subdivision must be under a single ownership, and for the purpose of encouraging the construction of residences. 
(3)  The residential lots are planned for future sale, and the residences will be privately financed under separate ownership. 
(4)  The residential lots in any project shall be legally subject to special assessments, which can be collected by the city in accordance with state statutes. 
(5)  The utility extensions must be for residential lots or comparable small tracts of land under separate ownership, where the city's special assessment policy is not applicable. 
(6)  Any project involving state or federal funds in the financing thereof is not eligible. Such financial restriction shall not apply to single-family residences under separate private ownership. 
(7)  Projects designed for rental units are not eligible. 
(8)  Only tracts of land that are within the city limits or will be annexed subject to project approval, are eligible for city financial participation. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
Sec. 22-104. - Same-City council authority. 
    The city reserves the right to determine the eligibility of any project, the limit of its participation, and the financial capability of the developer to meet future special assessments. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
DIVISION 3. - FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 22-105. - Owner/developer obligations. 
    The city's intent is to assist the owner/developer of a subdivision of land with the financing of streets and utilities, in an effort to encourage residential development within the city limits. To be eligible for city participation on a project, the developer must; 
(1)  Own the land. 
(2)  Furnish evidence that future special assessments will be paid. 
(3)  Furnish a performance bond, or a letter of credit, or an alternate surety that special assessments will be paid. 
(4)  Furnish references if requested, and information regarding previous projects. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
Sec. 22-106. - Method of financing. 
    Due to particular circumstances involving each project, the city reserves the right to select the method of financing which appears to be in the best interest of all parties involved. The time necessary to carry out the financial arrangements, and the city's involved risk are the most important considerations. Therefore the city may consider alternate methods of financing depending upon the scope of the project. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
Sec. 22-107. - Financing alternatives. 
(a)  In accordance with Article VI, section 26(d) of the Constitution of Missouri, the city, by vote of two-thirds of the qualified electors thereof voting therein, may become indebted for the purpose of constructing streets, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains. The city may provide that a portion or all of the cost of any such improvements will be levied and assessed on property benefitted by such improvements. The city must collect any special assessments so levied to retire the bonds issued for such improvements. 
(b)  Such bonds would be a general obligation of the city, and would be paid off within a period of twenty (20) years. 
(c)  Any assessment that has been levied against any lot or parcel of land would be due and payable upon its change in ownership. 
(d)  The voters within the city would authorize the sale of a certain dollar volume of bonds, a portion of which would be sold as each benefit district is established by the city council. 
(e)  The city reserves the right to take into consideration its financial risk in determining the feasibility of forming any particular benefit district. Particular attention will be given to other financial arrangements made by the developer which would affect payment of the special assessments to the city. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
Sec. 22-108. - Review board. 
(a)  For the purpose of administering this article, a review board shall meet upon call to review all preliminary applications which have been submitted to the city engineer's office. It shall be the responsibility of the review board to solicit whatever information is necessary to determine the eligibility of a particular project. Any project that is deemed feasible by the board, for financial participation by the city, shall be referred to the city council for final approval. Upon passage of a resolution by the city council at a regularly scheduled council meeting, the project would then be advanced through the financing process by the city engineer's office, with the assistance of the city administrator. 
(b)  Any decision rendered by the review board may be appealed to the city council for its consideration. Since the proposed projects involve the commitment of city funds, the council's decision will be final. 
(c)  The review board shall be comprised of the following persons: 
City administrator 
City engineer 
General superintendent CW&EP

Sec. 22-109. - Utility extensions. 
(a)  Upon a written request from an owner or owners of land, the city will consider financing the extension of utilities to serve designated lots or small tracts of land under separate ownership which front an existing street. 
(b)  Under such plan the city will address each request in the following manner: 
(1)  If a petition for a utility extension bears the names of more than fifty (50) percent of the property owners who own more than fifty (50) percent of the street frontage, all of the properties involved will be assessed for the improvement. 
(2)  If the petition for a utility extension is requested by less than fifty (50) percent of the property owners that would be served by the utility extension, the city, at its discretion, may proceed with the project by formally assessing only those property owners who have requested the utility extension. A special assessment would be levied against each petitioner's property, and such debt would be retired by annual installment payments over a period of years determined by the city upon approval of the project. The annual rate of interest would be eight (8) percent. Those properties which do not desire to participate in the project will not be formally assessed via a special assessment which would appear on the tax rolls. In lieu of that, the city engineer's office will maintain records showing the amount of the special assessment that would have been formally placed against the property via the tax rolls. At such time that an application is submitted for a building permit, or a utility connection, the applicant will be required to pay off in full, all of the assessments which have been held by the city. Such payment shall include an interest payment at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum. It shall be the property owner's responsibility to inform each new owner of the affected property, of the outstanding obligation. The city engineer's office will notify the county recorder's office of the informal assessment against the property at such time that it is made of record in the city engineer's office. 
(c)  As an alternate method of financing utility extensions, the board of public works, at its discretion, may finance utility extensions using reserve funds of the utility. The board shall have the authority to transfer reserve funds between utilities, as a loan. Such loans would be repaid in a manner determined by the general superintendent of Carthage Water and Electric.

DIVISION 4. - EXISTING CITY POLICY 

Sec. 22-110. - Special assessments. 
    At the time of passage of Ordinance No. 6162, the city had certain established policies pertaining to street improvements and extension of utilities. For the ease of future reference such policies are set forth as follows: 
(1)  Street improvements. In locations where individual property owners abut an existing street, and it is their desire to have the city construct the necessary storm water drainage facilities, curb and gutter, and street resurfacing, the owners may initiate pavement improvements by submitting a petition to the city. The petition must contain the signatures of more than fifty (50) percent of the property owners who own more than fifty (50) percent of the street frontage abutting the proposed improvement. 
After having ascertained that the petition is valid, the city will pay seventy-five (75) percent of the cost of the street improvements, and all of the cost of the drainage facilities. The abutting property owners will pay for twenty-five (25) percent of the cost of the street improvements and all of the cost for the curb and gutter. The property owners share of the cost is placed on the tax roll as a special assessment against each parcel of land abutting the improvement. Such assessment is required to be paid off over a period of five (5) years at an interest rate of eight (8) percent per annum. 
(2)  Sanitary sewers. To date the city is composed of eighty-eight (88) separate sewer districts, each of which has been assessed for the cost of the sanitary sewers constructed within each district. However, as alternate the property owners may construct their own sewers without becoming involved in the special assessment process. 
(3)  Water mains. Water main construction is financed similar to sanitary sewers, except that the assessment is established at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per foot along the abutting property. 
(Res. 1164, 4-11-89) 
DIVISION 5. - CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND 

Sec. 22-111. - Council to establish fund. 
(a)  The city council shall establish a capital improvement fund for the purpose of administering this article. Upon acceptance of this article, the city council shall place a referendum before the voters in the city for the issuance of $ ____________ of general obligation bonds, to be sold in increment amounts as acceptable projects are approved by the city council. According to Article VI, section 26(d) of the State Constitution, voter authorization for the issuance of the bonds requires a two-thirds majority of the voters. Should the referendum fail during the first ballot, the same issue shall be brought before the voters at a later date, at the city council's discretion. 
(b)  The city clerk shall be responsible for the capital improvement fund, similar to any other city funds.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER DETENTION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 6628, adopted July 26, 1994, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of § I (A-K) of said ordinance as §§ 24-201-24-211 was herein included at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 24-201. - In General. 
    Stormwater runoff and the velocity of discharge are considerably increased through development and growth of the city. 
    Prior to the development of the land, surface conditions provide a higher percentage of permeability and longer time of concentration. With the construction of buildings, parking lots, etc., permeability and the time of concentration are significantly decreased, resulting in an increase in both the rate and volume of runoff. 
    These modifications may create harmful effects on properties downstream. Therefore, to minimize these effects the following minimum stormwater detention requirements have been established. 
    This section shall apply to all industrial, commercial, institutional, apartment developments, and all housing developments containing one (1) acre or more, within the incorporated limits of the City of Carthage. Detention on areas of less than one (1) acre in size shall be at the discretion of the city engineer. 
    All housing developments containing one (1) acre or more lying outside the corporate limits of the City of Carthage shall not be considered for annexation until the owner of said development has submitted information to the City of Carthage Engineering Department showing stormwater retention plans as necessary to comply with the provisions of this section. Detention on areas of less than one (1) acre in size shall be at the discretion of the city engineer. 
    This section shall not apply to platted subdivisions or additions filed of record prior to the passage of this section, in which the streets and utilities have been constructed.

Sec. 24-202. - Stormwater detention plans. 
    A complete set of stormwater detention plans and calculations shall be provided for all construction projects which increase stormwater runoff. 
    Plans for the construction of public improvements shall be submitted to and approved by the city engineer. 
    The required stormwater detention plans for private improvements shall be submitted along with the building plans to the city engineer for review and approval. These plans shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Missouri.

Sec. 24-203. - General. 
    Introduction: This document provides acceptable procedures for designing storm drainage systems and detention facilities within the City of Carthage, Missouri. While these procedures or methods will provide for the design of most drainage systems and storage facilities, certain situations may require additional criteria or a more in-depth design than that described in this document. Designers are encouraged to discuss anticipated requirements for any new or rehabilitated system with the city engineer prior to commencing design. 
    Related documents: Construction requirements of components of the stormwater drainage system shall be as specified in the Standard Specifications for Street Construction, City of Carthage. 
    Erosion from construction activities shall be controlled as per the requirements of the City of Carthage, Model Best Management Practices (BMP's) for Land Disturbance. 
    Applicability: The criteria within this document shall apply to all new and storm drainage and detention facilities and to the rehabilitation of existing drainage systems and facilities. 
    Design requirements: All designs shall be completed under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Missouri. Designs shall be based on land use in the tributary area as zoned, as actually or proposed developed, or as indicated by the city's land use plan. The basis for determining which criteria shall be whichever use indicates the greatest runoff volume. 
    Precipitation data is shown in Table 1. These quantities shall be utilized in all calculations unless the designer can show sufficient evidence of justification for lesser amounts. 
    Runoff coefficients for various land uses are shown in Table 2 and shall be utilized for both pre-developed and post-developed conditions. 
    All drainage systems shall be designed with sufficient capacity to convey flows from a 25-year storm event. 
    Detention facilities shall be designed to limit post-development outflow volumes to equal to or less than pre-developed volumes for the 2-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year rainfall events.

The above table includes only values for inlets located in continuous grade road roadway. Designers shall provide capacities for inlets located in sag or ponded areas. 
(Ord. No. 10-12, § I, 5-11-10) 
Sec. 24-208. - Easements. 
    Two (2) types of easements shall be provided for stormwater detention. 
(1)  Access easement. All detention reservoirs with the exception of parking lot and roof detention shall be enclosed by an access easement. The limits of the easement shall extend ten (10) feet beyond the maximum anticipated ponding area. The limits and designation of detention facilities shall be shown on the project plans of final plat. 
(2)  Drainage easement. A minimum ten (10) feet wide drainage easement shall be provided within the reservoir area, connecting the tributary pipes and the discharge system, along the most direct possible routing of a piping system for possible future elimination of detention. The limits of the drainage easement shall be shown on the project plans of final plat. 
(Ord. No. 6628, § I (H), 7-26-94) 
Sec. 24-209. - Maintenance. 
    Detention facilities are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff they must be fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation. Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed periodically from the detention area and control structure in order to maintain full storage capacity. 
    The responsibility of maintenance of the detention facilities in single lot development projects shall remain with the general contractor until final inspection of the development is performed and approved, and a legal occupancy permit is issued. After legal occupancy of the project, the maintenance of detention facilities shall be vested with the owner of the project. 
    If the owner fails to provide a reasonable degree of maintenance and the facilities become inoperative or ineffective, City of Carthage crews may perform remedial work and assess the trustees or owner for the cost of repair and maintenance. 
    Upon conceptual approval of the location and final approval of the design and construction of multi-lot residential development projects, the City of Carthage will accept the responsibility for the maintenance of the detention facilities. Drainage and access easements will be required giving the City of Carthage the authority to gain vehicular access to the facility from a public street. 
(Ord. No. 6628, § I (I), 7-26-94; Ord. No. 97-50, § I, 9-23-97) 
Sec. 24-210. - Temporary detention. 
    It may be advantageous in some situations to delay the building of the permanent detention facilities until after the completion of the other improvements. In these situations temporary detention facilities must be provided. The permanent or temporary detention facilities must be constructed and be functional before proceeding with any other construction. 
(Ord. No. 6628, § I (J), 7-26-94) 
Sec. 24-211. - Off-site and regional detention concepts. 
(1)  Off-site detention. Stormwater detention facilities designed and constructed off-site or outside the limits of the proposed development will be considered for approval. This approval is contingent upon documentation being furnished to verify that drainage easements have been obtained for the channel area from the proposed development to the detention facility and including the detention area. The drainage easements must clearly set out provisions for maintenance. 
a.  Fees for offsite stormwater detention, for use of the city-owned detention facility, located in the Northwest corner of Lot 1, Block 2, Myers Park Subdivision #3, shall be paid to the city within ninety (90) days after issuance of the building permit by the engineering department. Use of said facility shall be subject to available capacity. Said fees shall be based on cubic feet of storage required for detention, as follows: 
Number of cubic feet required Fee per cubic foot 1 cu. ft.-9999 cu. ft. $0.90 per cu. ft. 10,000 cu. ft.-49,999 cu. ft.  0.75 per cu. ft. 50,000 cu. ft.-above  0.65 per cu. ft.  
(2)  Regional detention. Detention facilities designed and located to provide detention on major drainage channels will be considered as a regional detention facility. The drainage area considered for a regional detention facility must be five hundred (500) acres or greater. The facility must provide a detention volume for a 100-year storm for the entire drainage area, and must be designed with a variable control outlet structure that has a one (1) year maximum outlet opening. The regional detention facility must be designed with a low flow concrete channel through the limits of the basin.

A public hearing shall be held at the time this amendment is pending before the council as provided by law, and approval of the amendment shall constitute approval of the plan. 
(f)  Upon approval of the zoning change by amendment, to the zoning district map, the proponent shall submit a final development plan to the commission for its review and recommendations.

Upon approval of the council, such plan shall be filed for record in the office of the city clerk. 
(b)  If the final development plan fails to conform to the intent of the preliminary plan submitted in support of the rezoning, such final development plan may be submitted to the commission as an amended preliminary plan, upon which the commission shall advertise and hold a public hearing. The procedure shall be the same as for the original preliminary plan. 
(c)  No building permit shall be issued for any construction until the commission and the council shall have approved the final development plan, covering at least the first stage of development.

(e)  The proponents of a C-P district shall prepare and submit a schedule of construction in one (1) or more stages, which construction shall begin, within a specified period following the council's final approval of the final development plan or any stage thereof. Failure to begin the construction as scheduled shall void the plan, as approved, unless a request for an extension of time is made by the proponents to the commission, and approved by the commission and by the council. 
(f)  If for any reason, the plan is abandoned, or if the construction is terminated, during or after the completion of any stage and there is ample evidence that further development is not contemplated, the amendment establishing the district may be repealed by the council and the zoning of the entire tract, or the portion which is undeveloped as a district C-P, may be changed to a suitable classification. 
(g)  After the final development plan has been approved and the zoning change made, and when, in the course of carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of building, parking areas, entrances, heights, or open spaces are established by the approved final development plan, for the area to be covered by buildings, parking spaces, entrances, height, setback and other requirements, such adjustments may be approved by the council upon application, and after receiving the recommendation of the commission.

DIVISION 12. - DISTRICT AE, ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

Sec. 25-800. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of district AE is to identify and prescribe specific requirements and conditions for the location of certain defined adult entertainment activities. The district is designed as an overlay district in a certain zoning district. Adult entertainment uses do not occur on a frequent basis and require separate and specifically designed regulations for their development. Such adult entertainment uses are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly if several of such uses are concentrated, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. The location of such uses has an additional deleterious effect upon adjacent areas and could contribute to the blighting and downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The special regulation of adult entertainment uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse effect of such uses will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhood, whether residential or nonresidential, by location or concentration and to ensure the stability of such neighborhoods.

(16)  In districts D to G inclusive in computing the depth of a rear yard for any building where such yard abuts an alley, one-half of such alley may be assumed to be a portion of the rear yard. 
(17)  In any district where buildings on adjoining lots, used exclusively for dwelling purposes, do not conform to the side yard requirements of this chapter, the board may vary the side yard requirements, provided that no building may be built nearer than three (3) feet to the side lot line and provided that the width of the building allowable under this chapter may not be increased. 
(Code 1978, § 405.190) 
Sec. 25-1202. - Special height regulations adjacent to airports and landing strips. 
    The following additional regulations shall apply to lands situated adjacent to any airport or landing strip in the city which contains a runway or landing strip of four thousand (4,000) feet or less in length. The airport hazard area shall be defined and regulated as follows: 
(1)  Detailed description of hazard area: 
a.  The hazard area consists of approach zones, turning zones, and transition zones. The outer boundary of the hazard area is composed of a circle whose center is the midpoint of the centerline of the instrument runway or landing strip and having a radius of four thousand (4,000) feet, and which also constitutes the outer boundaries of the approach and turning zones. 
b.  The inner boundary of the hazard area is a boundary line consisting of a series of intersecting tangents, five hundred (500) feet from the parallel to the centerline of the instrument runway or landing strip and two hundred fifty (250) feet from the parallel to the respective centerlines of all other runways or landing strips and connecting the inner boundaries of adjacent approach zones at the ends of the runways, landing strips, or proposed runways or landing strips. 
(2)  Zone descriptions: 
a.  An approach zone shall be located at each end of each existing or proposed runway, landing strip or other portion of the airfield used regularly, or to be used regularly, for the landing or taking off of airplanes. Such approach zones shall begin two hundred (200) feet beyond the ends, their respective landing strips and at such beginning be five hundred (500) feet in width for all runways and landing strips and shall extend and expand uniformly centered along the extended centerline of the respective landing strip, to the outer boundary of the approach zone at a ratio of twenty (20) feet of width for each one hundred (100) feet of horizontal length for all runways. 
    The inner area of each approach zone shall be that portion of the approach zone beginning two hundred (200) feet beyond the end of the respective or proposed landing strip and extending to the intersection of the controlling glide angle with a plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport. 
    The outer area of each approach zone shall be the area between the inner area of the approach zone and the outer limit of the approach zone. 
b.  The turning zones shall compromise all portions of the hazard area not contained in the approach zones and in the transition zones. The outer limits of the turning zones shall be a circle the radius of which is four thousand (4,000) feet and whose center is the midpoint of the centerline of the longest runway or landing strip. 
c.  The transition zones shall be the areas bounded by the inner boundary of the hazard area, the sides of contiguous inner area of approach zones and the outer limits of the transition zones; the outer limits of the transition zones being the intersections at elevations of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport, of a series of continuous planes originating from bases established by the inner boundary of the hazard area and the edges of adjacent inner areas of approach zones. The planes rise from their respective bases at the rate of one (1) foot vertically to seven (7) feet horizontally to the lines of intersection previously referred to. 
(3)  Height regulations. No building or structure, including transmission line, communications line, pole tree, smokestack, chimney, wires, tower or other structure or appurtenances thereto of any kind or character shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered, nor shall any tree or other object of natural growth be allowed to grow: 
a.  In inner areas of approach zones to a height above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport in excess of one twentieth of the distance from a point two hundred (200) feet beyond the end of the runway or landing strip, to said structure or object. 
b.  In the outer area of approach zones and in turning zones to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the elevation of the highest point on any runway or landing strip on the airport. 
c.  In the transition zones to a height above the planes forming the transition slopes. 
d.  In the runways or landing strips to a height above the finished grade of said runways or landing strips. 
Regulations controlling height of buildings and structures adjacent to heliport shall be applied by the commission at the time that a permit is applied for and after receiving an aeronautical evaluation of the proposed facility by the Federal Aviation Agency as required by law. 
(4)  Permit. It shall hereafter be unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, repair, or establish any building, transmission line, communication line, pole, tree, tower, smokestack, chimney, wires, or other structure or appurtenance thereto of any kind or character or to plant or replant any tree or other object of natural growth, within the boundaries of the hazard area of an airport without first obtaining a building or land use permit from the building inspector. 
(5)  Nonconforming structures. Within the hazard areas as hereinbefore defined, no nonconforming building or structure, or object of natural growth shall hereafter be replaced, substantially reconstructed, repaired, altered, replaced, or allowed to grow, as the case may be, to a height which constitutes a greater hazard to air navigation than existed before these regulations if such structures or objects of natural growth have been removed, torn down or destroyed. 
(6)  Marking of nonconforming structures. Whenever the building inspector shall determine, or shall be notified by the Federal Aviation Agency that a specific structure exists within the zoned area hereinbefore described at such a height or in such a position as to constitute a hazard to the safe operation of aircraft landing at or taking off from the airport, the owner and the lessor of the premises on which such structure or object is located shall be notified in writing by the building inspector and shall within a reasonable time permit the marking thereof by suitable lights or other signals designated by the Federal Aviation Agency. The costs of such marking shall not be assessed against the owner of or lessor of the premises. 
(Code 1976, § 405.190) 
Sec. 25-1203. - Extensions into adjoining districts. 
    The board may grant a permit for the extension of use, height or area regulation into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district divides a lot in a single ownership at the time of the adoption of this chapter, such extension not to exceed fifty (50) feet.
